1,"Investors have been grasping for some sort of framework by which to compare the market rout stoked by the coronavirus outbreak. On Monday, the 11th anniversary of the bull market, they got it: 2008. While it may not be a perfect comparison, strategists are now pointing to the deep downturn during 2008 for clues as to where the markets today will go—and warning value stocks may not be the place for a tactical shift. Instead, many prefer companies with strong balance sheets. Markets globally tumbled Monday, with coronavirus concerns exacerbated by Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war. The S&P 500 opened down 7%, briefly halting trade.As confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China tripled in the past week and the U.S. began grappling with how to deal with the outbreak, strategists started preparing for their worst-case scenarios to become the baseline, even as a lot remained unknown.For the most part, strategists aren’t looking to jump in yet for bargains. “We’re looking for 2008 levels of market fear to tell us the bottoming process has begun and we expect that window will be shorter than the financial crisis,” writes Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. In a note to clients, Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote that 2008 was a financial shock that hit demand whereas the coronavirus shock is one that is hitting both demand and supply and that means it is likely to play out differently. As a result, he expects a sharp economic hit that will play out more like a recession than a depression.• While the 2008 crisis created a deep recession and a slow recovery as both households and financial firms had to heal their balance sheets, the virus is likely to spark sharp drops in output in the affected economies over the next quarter but, as long as virus fades, activity should bounce back as supply constraints are eased. In other words, Shearing writes, expect a short, sharp shock.• Typically, fiscal and monetary stimulus work by boosting demand. But today, the problem lies with both supply and demand. Loans and subsidies to the hardest-hit companies—targeted, temporary and large fiscal support—could offset the shock and central bankers could ease credit troubles with cheap financing to banks to the worst-hit companies. But the speed of the recovery is predicated largely on how the virus spreads and life returns to normal, he notes.• Asset-price collapses have historically triggered severe depressions in the past. In 2008, high levels of leverage in the banking system and other vulnerabilities in the global financial system, such as a dependence on wholesale finance and short-term credit lines, magnified the situation, Shearing notes. The good news: Though debt levels are high, they are concentrated in the government rather than households and thus less risky and banks are better-capitalized. The pockets of vulnerabilities are not big enough to trigger a global crisis, Shearing says. • The biggest risk beyond the immediate coronavirus is likely what the Japanification of more of the developed economies means, where more countries get stuck in a rut of anemic growth and perpetually low interest rates. Interest-rate cuts made to combat this crisis could push more investors to reach for yield, eventually causing bubbles to inflate, thus sowing the seeds of the next major crisis, he warns.Shearing’s outlook is the kind that has investors rushing to find some safety. But most low-volatility stocks are trading at premiums that are making them unattractive to some. And while value stocks sometimes do well out of market routs, strategists aren’t so sure this time. Better positioned may be strong balance-sheet companies. In a note to clients, Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, co-head of portfolio strategy at Bernstein Research, gives two reasons it is hard to make a case for a tactical shift to value: The biggest value sectors are banks and energy—both of which face severe challenges as interest rates tumble, credit risks rise and oil prices plummet. Fraser-Jenkins says large-cap energy stocks could become a core part of an income strategy—but in the medium term rather than the short term. While many investors flock to low-volatility stock because they tend to do well as earnings growth turns negative, Fraser-Jenkins cautions that these stocks tend to reverse quickly as earnings growth bottoms. Plus, in the U.S., low-volatility stocks are expensive and highly linked to short-term bond-yield moves. With the quality of corporate credit at its lowest point in two decades and balance-sheet quality not priced into the stock market the way other quality measures are, Fraser-Jenkins favors stocks of companies with good balance-sheet quality. Plus, companies with strong balance sheets in the U.S. and Europe aren’t expensive, with relative valuations around the middle of their post-1997 historic range—a “relatively inexpensive entry point” for investors seeking protection from the market rout.Electronic Arts      (ticker: EA),            Alphabet      (GOOG),            Procter & Gamble      (PG),            Walmart      (WMT),            Biogen      (BIIB),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Visa      (V), and            Accenture      (ACN) are among the U.S. companies Bernstein listed as having a sector neutral low leverage and high credit ratings, as well as an Outperform rating.The lesson: Not everything that was “safe” last time will be this time around.

0,"Shares in            Publicis      Groupe rose as much as 4% on Thursday after the world’s third biggest advertising group by sales confirmed its outlook for 2020. But challenges remain as clients continue to cut ad spending amid competition from Facebook and Alphabet’s Google. The back story. The French ad giant behind marketing campaigns for companies including Coca-Cola (KO) and            L’Oréal      (LRLCY) has had a challenging year as clients tighten their budgets in a tough economic environment. It lowered its guidance twice in 2019.Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun has been trying to offset the fall in traditional ad spending by reorganizing the business, including investing heavily in data capabilities and technology as spending moves online. In July, it paid $4.4 billion to buy Epsilon, the marketing-services company, from            Alliance Data Systems. Whats new. Publicis (PUB.France), which competes against bigger rivals            WPP      (WPP) and            Omnicom      Group (OMC), recorded an 8.5% decline in net profit to €841 million (about $923 million) in the year ended December 31. This was on revenues of €9.8 billion, up 9.3% over the period, compared with €9 billion in 2018. The company confirmed its earlier outlook for 2020 organic sales growth, saying its underlying sales would evolve in the range of -2% and +1%. It also continues to target an operating margin rate of around 17%, driven by the reorganization and new sources of revenue.Shares in Publicis, which have fallen by nearly 30% in the past year, were trading 3.06% higher at €41.37 at 12:30 GMT. Looking Ahead. Sadoun’s strategy of fending off competition from tech giants, as well as consulting firms like            Accenture      (ACN), by focusing on data analytics is starting to work. The French group has scored a series of big mandates including Walt Disney (DIS), Swiss drugmaker            Novartis      (NVS) and snacks company            Mondelez International      (MDLZ) and can now offer them technological tools on top of traditional creative marketing campaigns. For now, that seems enough to have convinced analysts at UBS to assign a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of €44.00. Shares in Publicis Groupe rose as much as 4% on Thursday after the world’s third biggest advertising group by sales confirmed its outlook for 2020.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Danaher      is famous for its business system that effectively integrates small, bolt-on acquisitions. The company has completed more than six transactions a year on average for the last five years. The strategy has worked for investors. Danaher stock has returned more than 20% a year for the last 10 years on average, 4.5 percentage points better than the Dow Jones Industrial Average.What does a conglomerate (ticker: DHR) have in common with a software company you may never have heard of?            Open Text      (OTEX) is Canada’s largest software company, providing enterprise information management products. Like Danaher, it spends free cash flow on small, bolt-on acquisitions—completing about four deals a year on average for the past five years. And Open Text shares have returned more than 17% a year on average for the last 10 years—nearly as impressive as Danaher’s. What’s more, Open Text’s reasonable valuation and stable business model should help it repeat the feat over the next 10 years.Open Text software products help businesses and governments become digital—putting legacy data into the cloud. Its strategic partners include            Microsoft      (MSFT),            Oracle      (ORCL),            SAP      (SAP),            Accenture      (ACN) and Deloitte. Open Text has more than 120,000 customers and 100 million users in over 110 countries. It’s a significant global operation with a market value in excess of $10 billion. The U.S. software sector has been incredibly hot lately. The software components of the S&P 500 have returned nearly 24% a year for the last five years, nearly double the return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the same span. And software valuations have exploded, rising from four times price to sales—a common metric used by investors valuing the high-growth, high-margin software sector—to more than seven times price to sales.Investors have bid up software companies in recent years because of the transition to recurring revenues. Software companies no longer sell periodic updates. Instead they sign customers up on a subscription basis. The predictable pattern of revenues has been rewarded by investors with higher multiples.That’s not the case with Open Text though. Its valuation is less than four times forward estimated sales, exactly where it was five years ago. That fact belies strong fundamentals. The company boasts a 7% free cash flow yield—double that of the software components of the S&P 500. Open Text revenue has grown at 14% a year on average from 2014 to 2018. And 75% of sales are contractually recurring. So what’s not to like?RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Treiber rates the shares Outperform with a $47 price target, 22% higher than recent prices. Trieber thinks the valuation is attractive and believes that margins have additional upside once the company finishes integrating a $1.7 billion enterprise software company bought from            Dell Technologies      (DELL) in 2017.Software stocks, including Open Text, are attractive for another reason. Private equity attention. PE firms just acquired two software companies for more than six times sales. Mindbody was bought by Vista Equity Partners in February and Thoma Bravo announced plans to buy          Ellie Mae      (ELLI) in February as well. That deal will close later in 2019.It’s not just private equity players who are interested in software. Activist investors have noticed the valuation discrepancy in Open Text, too. Blue Harbour owns 3.7% of Open Text’s outstanding stock. There is no guarantee activist ownership means a deal is imminent, but the PE and activist attention helps put a floor under its valuation and makes Open Text stock less risky.It appears Open Text stock has flown under the radar to this point. That’s surprising given how investors have gobbled up software stocks in recent years. Now, if U.S. software valuations look concerning you can look North of the border for better value.

1,"Adobe      shares were trading lower Thursday afternoon as the company gave an early hint about how the software sector could be affected by the growing coronavirus crisis. For the fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 28, Adobe (ticker: ADBE) posted revenues of $3.09 billion, up 19% year over year, ahead of the Wall Street analyst consensus at $3.04 billion. It was Adobe’s first-ever quarter with more than $3 billion in revenue. Non-GAAP earnings were$2.27 a share, above the Street consensus at $2.23. The company said profits were reduced by 7 cents a share for the cancellation of corporate events due to the coronavirus, or Covid-19, situation.For the second quarter, the company sees revenue of $3.175 billion, above the previous consensus at $3.12 billion, with non-GAAP earnings of $2.35 a share, two pennies above the previous consensus at $2.33.Adobe said guidance reflects the expected impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. The company said its revenue and earnings “are relatively predictable as a result of its subscription-based business model,” but that it does expect some companies to defer bookings decisions, delay consulting services implementations, and reduce marketing spend. Adobe expects reduced consumer spending in countries more adversely impacted by the virus situation and some impact on software license revenue driven by channel partners. “These impacts are expected to be more prominent in countries and industries most affected by the crisis,” the company said.Adobe Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said in an interview with Barron’s that the company had a great first quarter, but that it has started to see some impact from Covid-19, in particular on its consulting services business, which is “higher touch,” with salespeople, consultants, and people working on site to implement software. The company can’t recognize revenue for services it can’t deliver due to travel and other restrictions. Murphy said guidance would have been higher without the effects of the virus.Adobe shares were flat in late trading Thursday. The stock was down 9.6%, to $285, in the regular session.

All Rights ReservedWith the stock market in full freak-out mode, most investors are ignoring analyst advice on individual issues—every stock now looks a lot cheaper than it was a month ago, or even a week ago. The news that matters is macro in nature—the focus is on the coronavirus outbreak, not incremental improvements in cash flow estimates. That dynamic has spurred some Wall Street pundits to get philosophical—and to coach investors on sticking to their guns on companies with compelling investment stories.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who covers a wide range of tech names, took the barbell approach in a research note this morning, trying to pull back to the 30,000-foot level, while also offering some practical suggestions on stocks to buy while everything is on sale.“Across the tech space the red screens are front and center for investors as the panic, fear, and worries about a coronavirus-driven economic downturn continue to pressure stocks across the board,” he writes. “Our investing philosophy in times of crisis is to do a bottoms up analysis and stress test the models of our top tech names/themes vs. a sensitivity in valuations. If stocks stick out with a green light based on this exercise and framework, we hand hold investors to buy these dips through this volatility, own the names for the other side of this panic, and see the forest through the trees on the fundamental drivers for the next decade in tech.”Ives thinks that a “surge of strategic and financial buyer driven M&A could be on the horizon over the coming months as valuations start to reach levels which can ignite a long-overdue deal frenzy that could start to put a floor on the software sector as well.” He thinks            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT), Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google,            IBM      (IBM),            Adobe      (ADBE) and            Oracle      (ORCL) could all look to take advantage of their strong balance sheets to beef up their cloud portfolios.Ives writes that he remains bullish on cloud computing, 5G wireless handsets, and cybersecurity. “Does an economic slowdown impact these models and valuations? The answer is a clear yes,” he writes. “However, looking past the fear and panic (and a potential short-lived economic dent/softness), we believe these high-priority areas of spending and business models have attractive risk/rewards looking ahead and we would be buying these tech names at current levels.”His picks: Write to Eric J.

0,"The enterprise-software sector isn’t going to be a haven from the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at both            Citigroup      and Jefferies weighed in on the group Wednesday morning, and both made wholesale estimate cuts for the enterprise-software companies they cover. These companies aren’t directly subject to supply-chain issues or reduced consumer demand, but they have an assortment of vulnerabilities nonetheless as the coronavirus dampens economic activity worldwide.Citi’s Walter Pritchard asserts that “the global reaction to the outbreak will cause some short-term impact on the ability of software companies to close business.” He notes that a number of companies report earnings this week—including            Adobe      (ticker: ADBE),            Oracle      (ORCL),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and            DocuSign      (DOCU)—which will provide a fresh look at the impact of the virus on software demand. He’s keeping a close eye on Adobe and Oracle, both of which report February quarters and which have “meaningful Japan exposure.”Pritchard sees the companies affected by both soft demand in Asia and risk to high-touch sales models as travel is curtailed and trade shows and meetings are canceled. He also expects a hit to more transactional revenue, like advertising. Companies more tied to recurring revenue, where selling is less required, will be less vulnerable, he says. Pritchard cut estimates for many, but not all, of the companies he covers, noting that the most significant cuts affect            Ceridian HCM      Holding (CDAY),            Check Point Software Technologies      (CHKP),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD),            Dynatrace      (DT),            Guidewire Software      (GWRE), MicroStrategy (MSTR),            Open Text      (OTEX),            PTC      (PTC),            Splunk      (SPLK),            SAP      (SAP), and            Zscaler      (ZS).In a similar vein, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill cut estimates for 40 companies in his coverage universe for their current fiscal years by 1%-3%. Thill notes that over the past few weeks, a number of companies have already made cautious comments on the outlook.Microsoft      (MSFT), for instance, warned that it won’t reach its previous target in its “More Personal Computing” segment, which includes Windows.            VMware      (VMW) cited virus-related impact on Asian demand, and            Zendesk      (ZEN) pointed to virus risk at a recent analyst day. And Thill notes that March quarter guidance from companies on a normal calendar reporting scheduled likely provided their outlook before the global outbreak, and could be at risk.Thill says companies with exposure to perpetual licenses and multiyear on-premise licenses are most at risk, as travel restrictions reduce the mobility and impact of software sales and support staff. He cites            Check Point,Commvault      (CVLT), Oracle,            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW),            SailPoint      (SAIL),            Tufin Software Technologies      (TUFN), and VMware as companies with high license-revenue exposure. He sees more limited impact for companies with lower touch sales and implementation models. In that group, he includes            Atlassian      (TEAM),            Bill.com      (BILL),            Cloudflare      (NET),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            HubSpot      (HUBS),            Dropbox      (DBX), and Zendesk. Thill says            Intuit      (INTU) is “one of our most defensive names, with subscription-based small business accounting and predictable tax business.” He also likes            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), since “worker mobility is a potential long-term driver of incremental licenses and could benefit from increased remote working near-term.”The Jefferies analyst adds that he would be wary of companies with elevated revenue multiples, which he argues could be more vulnerable to sharp declines. Companies he covers trading at more than 15 times the next 12 months’ revenue include            Bill.com      (BILL),            Shopify      (SHOP),            Datadog      (DDOG),            RingCentral      (RNG),            Paycom Software      (PAYC), Atlassian, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and            Smartsheet      (SMAR).Thill suggests software investors focus on companies with strong fundamental stories and high profitability, calling out Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit,            ServiceNow      (NOW), and Ring Central.Amid a sharp, broad market decline Wednesday, almost all software stocks are trading lower.

0,"While painful for many investors, the recent global equity selloff has presented a “golden opportunity” to buy some solid technology stocks cheaper.That’s according to Wedbush analysts, who have offered up 10 tech names to own in the coronavirus rout, which wiped $4.3 trillion off Wall Street equities last week, and threatened to take a little more off the table on Monday.The long-term “transformational bullish trends of cloud computing, 5G EV, streaming and cybersecurity for the next few years,” won’t be altered, even if the virus proves to be a near-term hit on supply chains and demand, analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe told clients in a note.Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT) is at the top of their shopping list. Shares fell 9% last week, and the tech giant took PC guidance off the table due to the virus. Yes, it has China supply-chain issues, but the rest of its guidance is unchanged. It’s a long-term cloud player that shouldn’t be dismissed, say analysts.Apple      (AAPL) is worth owning because once the coronavirus-interrupted supply chain gets back to full speed, the iPhone growth story will resume, they say. Apple recently issued a warning over the virus. Its shares dropped 12% last week.Tesla      (TSLA) slumped 25% last week. The coronavirus is a speed bump that will be short-lived and could just move out a “handful of deliveries” from the March to June quarter for the electric car maker, the analysts maintain. Therefore it’s still worth owning.Wedbush also likes software group            Adobe      (ADBE), whose shares fell 7% last week. The company isn’t expected to be affected by the coronavirus, and has some big tailwinds headed into this year. Elsewhere, cloud-security group            Zscaler      (ZS), identity governance software maker            SailPoint Technologies Holdings      (SAIL), software companies            Nuance Communications      (NUAN) and            NICE      (NICE), e-signature technology group            DocuSign      (DOCU), and ride-sharing group            Uber Technologies       (UBER) are on Wedbush’s list of tech stocks to own.

0,"Robert Smith, head of the private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners, is known for his wildly successful technology investments, and he says that both the tech industry and private equity have a woman problem. Smith, who was trained as an engineer before he became a Goldman Sachs Group (ticker: GS) banker, said he has heard some of the stories of problems women have encountered working in tech. Nearly 58% of women aged 16 or more participate in the U.S. workforce, according to January 2020 data from the Labor Department. But they account for only about 30% of jobs at major tech companies, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In 2019, women made up roughly 23% of tech jobs globally at Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB). “There’s a lot wrong with tech. The stuff that I read gets back to that ‘bro culture,’” Smith said. He estimated that his engineering classes at Cornell University were “about 80% pale males. Probably more than that.” Smith, who is African-American, opted for a study group that included a man from Cuba and a woman from Michigan. His classmates, meanwhile, formed study groups that had little diversity. “They grow up with that,” he said. These male executives went on to secure positions at companies with similar-looking people, Smith said. When it’s time to hire, these people typically pick subordinates that look “just like them,” he said. Sometimes the hiring is a product of unconscious bias, but sometimes it is conscious, he said. “Part of what you have to do in the tech industry is train away from that,” Smith said. He mentioned Satya Nadella, CEO of            Microsoft      (MSFT), and Sundar Pichai, head of            Alphabet,      who are both Indian-American. “They’re not pale males are they?...Talent can be found anywhere on the planet. The point is to find it, cultivate it, develop it and give it opportunity to bloom. That’s how I think about it.”Smith made the comments Wednesday after hosting a panel at the “Women’s Business Leadership in Tech: Unlocking the Value of Gender Diversity,” an annual event that is co-sponsored by Vista Equity at Columbia Business School. More than 300 executives and students, mostly women, attended the conference, which is meant to increase gender diversity in the tech workforce. Smith graduated from Columbia’s business school in 1994. While tech may have a diversity issue, Smith’s firm celebrates its women. Founded in 2000 by Smith and Brian Sheth, Vista Equity invests in software, data, and tech companies. The buyout shop has more than $52 billion in cumulative capital commitments. Vista, like many private-equity firms, does more than buyouts. The firm also has credit, consulting and public strategies arms. In 2018, Vista sold Marketo to Adobe (ADBE) for $4.75 billion, making $3 billion in just two years. The return was the single biggest profit in Vista’s history, Forbes said at the time. Vista employs more than 450 people across its various businesses, including credit and consulting. Nearly half, or 43%, of its staff are women, while people of color comprise about one-third, or 29%. When it comes to Vista senior staff, 23% are women and 30% are people of color. Two of its funds, Endeavor and credit, are co-led by women, Smith said. The firm’s external board of directors is also 40% women. “Vista, you know, is the most diverse private-equity firm out there now,” he said.Women also lead several of Vista’s portfolio companies. The firm uses aptitude tests and personality profiles to identify talented executives. Smith pointed to Angela Pecoraro, CEO of Advicent, a wealth tech company that Vista owns. Pecoraro started out in tech support at Zywave in 2002. She was managing a customer-relations team when Vista bought the company in 2008. (Zywave changed its name to Advicent in 2013.) The firm identified Pecoraro through its high-potential leadership program roughly eight years ago. She was named Advicent’s chief executive in April 2017. “When I talk about meritocracy, we test every employee. We don’t care what you look like, where you go, who you love, all that sort of stuff,” Smith said. “That’s how Angela got on our radar screen. She’s now a CEO.” Vista’s diversity gains come as women inch forward in the private-equity industry. Women make up only 19.4% of all private-equity employees globally, up from 17.9% in 2017, Preqin said in November. Most women in the business can be found in investor relations or marketing, the research firm said. Female executives make up only 11.5% of senior roles, a nearly 3% increase from 2017, when the figure was 9%, Preqin said. Smith has spoken before about the lack of women in private equity. In 2014, he echoed            Facebook      COO Sheryl Sandberg when he said publicly that women in PE needed to “lean in, lean in” and not take time off from the industry if they wanted to succeed. Now, he thinks the lack of women is partly due to a “pipeline” problem. Private-equity firms usually grow talent organically, hiring staff as associates at the beginning of their careers. Typically, after five years, 50% have exited for various reasons, Smith said. Firms that only hire a few female associates face the risk that, down the line, they won’t have women candidates for more senior positions. “You’ve got to build a critical mass in the pipe knowing at the rate that people decide to go do different things,” he said. Vista has posted 22% annualized returns since the firm’s launch, a spokesman confirmed. Investors, Smith said, are often surprised that Vista’s returns are often three times better than other firms. He said he hopes limited partners, or investors, realize that diversity helps Vista analyze businesses, underwrite them better, transform the operations of these companies and build more sustainable business practices. “You know we leverage and utilize the diversity of people in everything that we do. That’s just how we operate,” Smith said.

That’s when Denmark-based Astralis Group will become the first pure-play e-sports team to go public, with a ticker of ASTGRP. If that means nothing to you, consult your nearest 20-something. E-sports, or competitive videogaming, is riding a wave of younger viewers increasingly attractive to advertisers in a world of cord-cutting and aging sports audiences. Market research firm Newzoo estimates e-sports revenue at more than $1.1 billion in 2019. ESPN recently reported that a franchise slot in one of the biggest games, League of Legends, sold for $33 million. Newzoo e-sports chief, Remer Rietkerk, notes that Astralis has unique brands for its three teams: Astralis, playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive; Origen with League of Legends; and Future FC with FIFA. Its Counter-Strike team is among the world’s best, while Origen owns one of the 10 franchise league slots in Europe. Venture-capital investors and traditional sports owners are moving in. But Astralis CEO Nikolaj Nyholm tells Barron’s its investments in league slots need to last beyond a 10-year VC life cycle. “The public market allows us ample opportunity to raise funds and for our investors to come and go as they see fit, without my co-founder and I being forced to sell our shareholding,” he says.Will Hershey, CEO of Roundhill Investments, which sponsors an e-sports exchange-traded fund, says investors are watching to see how the market values Astralis. Astralis has set a price of 8.95 Danish Krone a share, or $1.33, a valuation of $75.5 million.

Thursday is a technology-heavy day:            Adobe,Oracle,      and            Broadcom      all report.—according to a forecast by eMarketer. That would be a third more than this year.One way to play that explosive growth could be to invest in            Trade Desk       (TTD). The company’s platform is used by ad buyers to create and manage their campaigns. Trade Desk then takes a cut of spending.Investors are already excited about the opportunity. Trade Desk stock has more than doubled this year. But several analysts see it continuing to climb in 2020.—in its initial public offering today. And the Denmark-based company isn’t like any other publicly traded one out there today. That’s because it’s an e-sports team, active in three video-game leagues where players compete for prizes.Competitive videogaming is already a big business—one estimate puts revenue at more than $1.1 billion this year.

0,"In the days before coronavirus, when markets were hitting new highs, technology stocks were the tip of the spear. Just a few weeks ago, there were four U.S. companies with market valuations above $1 trillion, all of them tech stocks. Those companies—            Microsoft       (ticker: MSFT),            Apple      (AAPL),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and Google parent            Alphabet      (GOOGL)—with their fortress-solid balance sheets, are poised to come out of the downturn just as strong as they went in. But for intrepid tech investors, there are less obvious opportunities to be found amid the current carnage and chaos.To help find the best ideas, Barron’s reached out to a few of our favorite tech-focused stockpickers. Some clear themes run through their recommendations: The work-from-home revolution underlines the power of cloud computing; we all still need to be entertained, even if we’re stuck at home; and we’re still going to need broadband, now more than ever.Here’s what the experts have to say: David Readerman Readerman is proprietor of Endurance Capital Partners, a San Francisco–based tech hedge fund. Readerman has zeroed in on cloud plays. “What’s certainly being reinforced right now,” he says, “is that cloud-based information-technology architecture is providing agility and resiliency for companies to operate dispersed workforces.”Readerman says the jury is out on whether there’s a lasting impact on how we work, but he adds that contingency planning now requires the ability to work remotely for extended periods. Among his cloud software picks are            DocuSign      (DOCU), a provider of digital-signature software, and            Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), the videoconferencing company that has been one of the year’s best stocks. “If there was ever doubt about the migration of the enterprise to cloud platforms, Covid-19 has proved its capabilities,” he says.Readerman concedes that Zoom’s valuation looks extreme—the stock trades at 34 times Wall Street’s sales estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2022—but he says there’s an opportunity for Zoom to monetize its surge in new users. He thinks that Zoom can expand beyond videoconferencing to offer a wider range of tools. “Zoom reminds me of AOL when it was everywhere, with ease of use and the freemium model,” he says.Readerman is bullish, too, on data center operators like            Equinix       (EQIX) and            Digital Realty Trust      (DLR). On the more speculative side, he likes their smaller rivals,            CyrusOne      (CONE) and            CoreSite Realty       (COR), which could be consolidation targets. He says that            Equinix      is seeing a surge in traffic to its servers, another sign of the growth of the cloud-computing trend. “Grocery stores are sold out of toilet paper, and we all need more broadband,” he says. Companies like            Equinix,      he adds, are “the critical on/off ramp for internet-based connectivity and commerce.” Rich Greenfield Greenfield, the co-founder of research boutique LightShed Partners, has covered entertainment and media companies for 25 years. His coverage universe was dealing with disruption—the technological kind—long before coronavirus, but the pandemic is creating a set of more serious challenges, with movie theaters and theme parks closed, sports shuttered, and ad budgets crunched. Greenfield notes that 12 of the top 50 TV advertisers are ailing auto makers; another 11 are quick-serve restaurant chains. The lack of sports content is particularly problematic on the advertising front. The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was canceled, and the National Basketball Association season, Major League Baseball, and the Olympics have all been delayed. There is no clarity on when the event calendar will pick up—and when people will be comfortable in public settings. “How long does it last?” Greenfield asks. “Does the stimulus ward off a recession or depression? It’s hard to tell. No one knows how to forecast this.”But people still crave entertainment, and that’s keeping Greenfield bullish on            Netflix      (NFLX). Unlike most content companies, Netflix sells no ads. And while movie and TV production is shut, Netflix has several months of new content ready to go. “They’re in a really strong position relative to their peers,” he says, pointing to            Walt Disney      (DIS), which has been battered on multiple fronts—its ESPN has no sports to show, its theme parks are closed, and it has no open theaters through which to distribute films. The weak ad market, meanwhile, is problematic for Disney’s broadcast and cable properties.Says Greenfield: “More people are using Netflix than ever before.” He notes that the number of subscribers is accelerating, which isn’t surprising given all of the home-bound people with more hours to fill and no sports to watch. He says Netflix will benefit from people switching to more expensive multiple-user plans and from reduced churn, or cancellations. In coming quarters, he says, Netflix will have “higher subscriptions, higher average revenue per user, and better free cash flow than people think.” Greenfield is also bullish on            Twitter      (TWTR), which this past week warned that revenue for its March quarter would be down year over year, as ad budgets fall. But, he notes, Twitter is seeing record usage. While profits and revenue will take a near-term hit, he points out that Twitter can withstand the crisis, with $6.6 billion in cash. And the company is poised to benefit from a crowded events calendar once the virus threat ebbs. “There aren’t enough weekends on the calendar for all the stuff coming down from September through summer 2021,” Greenfield says, with spring sporting events shifted to the fall, a packed film-release schedule, and the November election. “It’s absurd.” And he thinks it will all drive traffic—and ad dollars—to Twitter.  Paul Meeks Meeks wears multiple hats, as a portfolio manager for Independent Solutions Wealth Management, an asset management firm in Williamsville, N.Y., and a manager of The Wireless Fund, a small tech mutual fund. Meeks say that he has been using the recent rally to raise cash, while dabbling in marquee names and “banking proceeds for a better day.” Meeks says that he’s waiting until “earnings estimates are slashed to the bone” before making substantial new commitments. “I need to see them all confess all their sins, and to take down numbers dramatically.” In the meantime, Meeks has been nibbling on megacaps, specifically Amazon and            Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA), both of which he thinks will benefit from the expanded role that e-commerce will play in the post-coronavirus world. Eventually, he says, when earnings estimates reset, he wants to own his “dream team of semiconductor stocks,” including            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD),            Lam Research      (LRCX),            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing      (TSM),            Micron Technology      (MU), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT), where he expects to go from basically zero to a big overweight. Meanwhile, Meeks is bullish on            Virtu Financial      (VIRT), a New York–based tech-driven financial trading platform. Meeks sees the company as a play on volatility. He notes that Virtu trades for about 10 times earnings and pays a “fairly certain” dividend, currently yielding 4.3%. “When stocks go up endlessly again, and investors are complacent, they become an average company again,” he says. But, for now, Virtu will benefit as long as we continue to see “whipsaw moves in both directions.” Dan Niles Niles is founder and portfolio manager for the Satori Fund, a tech-focused hedge fund. On Feb. 17, just after Apple pulled its March quarter guidance, Niles tweeted that he had 50% of his portfolio short Apple, seven of the company’s suppliers, and        QQQ,      an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. It was a prescient call. Niles remains generally bearish on the market, but there are stocks he likes and owns, particularly around videogames. While Niles thinks the market has exaggerated the impact of a fifth-generation, or 5G, iPhone launch later this year, he sees opportunity in a less-watched product cycle: new videogame consoles from Microsoft and            Sony      (SNE), expected this fall. “They’re going to launch the first new hardware platforms since 2013, and everyone is stuck at home,” he says. “I like them all,” he says of the videogame stocks, including            Zynga      (ZNGA),            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO), and            Electronic Arts      (EA), along with China’s            NetEase      (NTES) and            Tencent Holdings      (700.Hong Kong).Other Niles bets are Amazon, a beneficiary from the shift to e-commerce, and work-at-home play            RingCentral      (RNG), a cloud-based communications provider. Meanwhile, he’s still ready to short Apple again as the stock rallies. For one thing, he says, “I don’t know who is going to feel rich enough to buy an iPhone.” And he wonders why anyone would pay 19 times current earnings for Apple, when other hardware plays like            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ) trade for just seven times.  Craig Moffett Moffett, founder of the research boutique MoffettNathanson, is the market’s most influential telecom and cable seer. He predicts deep issues for some of the largest companies he covers, notably            AT&T      (T) and            Comcast      (CMCSA), given their exposure to ad-supported content through their respective WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal segments. AT&T and Comcast are getting a boost from their broadband units, but Moffett sees better ways to play that trend.He’s bullish on            Charter Communications      (CHTR) and            Altice USA       (ATUS), both pure plays on the cable business and, therefore, free of ad-supported content worries. Charter is down 13% over the past month. “The fact that Charter has sold off as much as the broader market makes no sense at all,” Moffett says. “The cable companies are simply digital infrastructure providers. They are agnostic about how you can get your video content. And the broadband business is going to be just fine.” He says that Altice, while a little riskier than Charter, is even cheaper. Both companies are seeing demand for faster—and more expensive—broadband plans, with parents and children spending so many hours at home. Moffett thinks that Altice could rally 40% to 50%, while Charter could rise 30% to 40%. Moffett is also bullish on            T-Mobile US      (TMUS), which is about to be a strong No. 3 player in the U.S. wireless market after it closes a pending deal to buy            Sprint      (S). “They’ll be very well positioned, with line of sight to cost savings and margin expansion, and network advantages that should translate into market-share gains for years and years to come,” he says. And while Moffett still sees some risk to the deal’s completion, he thinks that T-Mobile is attractive with or without Sprint.  Write to Eric J.

0,"Add servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

1,"Advanced Micro Devices      shares are trading higher Tuesday after Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar upped his rating on the microprocessor company’s stock to Overweight from Neutral, with a new price target of $56, up from $45.AMD shares (ticker: AMD) had dropped 19% from their peak on Feb. 19 through Monday’s close. Kumar contends that the pullback—triggered by concerns over the coronavirus—“provides an attractive opportunity for long-term investors.” Kumar trimmed his near-term estimates to reflect the impact of the virus, but raised his long-term estimates. “From a product standpoint, we believe AMD is extremely well positioned in its laptop/desktop and data center markets, and we see several tailwinds in these markets to provide significant growth over the next several years,” he writes in a research note. “The company has established a solid cadence of new product introductions over the last few years, and we believe customers are more than comfortable with AMD’s product set. In addition, we expect AMD to continue to gain share from            Intel      INTC over the next several years, as the company now offers as good or better performance at roughly the same cost in many of its competing markets.”Kumar trimmed his 2020 earnings-per-share forecast to $1.09, from $1.13, but lifts his 2021 view to $1.59, from $1.49. He argues the company can earn $1.93 a share in 2022. Street consensus estimates are $1.15 a share for 2020 and $1.58 for 2021. AMD is holding a meeting with analysts on Thursday, Kumar notes.AMD stock is up 3.3%, at $49.03, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      is up 0.1%. Write to Eric J.

0,"Instinet analyst David Wong believes            Nvidia      stock will fall because of the coronavirus impact on its sales. On Monday,        iShares PHLX Semiconductor       exchange-traded fund (ticker: SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor sector index, fell nearly 5% after reports of further coronavirus infections outside of China, including in South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Earlier this month, Nvidia reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter and gave guidance for its current quarter ahead of Wall Street expectations. But Wong says the chip maker may be underestimating the risk of the virus outbreak. Consequently, he lowered his rating for Nvidia shares (NVDA) on Monday to Reduce from Neutral. “In our view, the risks to the global semiconductor industry posed by the COVID-19 outbreak have grown over the last few weeks,” he wrote. “We consider NVIDIA’s gaming GPUs and Nintendo Switch based chips to be consumer discretionary items. We think the economic dislocations resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak pose risk to demand in most electronic end markets.”The analyst cited how Nvidia’s gaming chip business accounts for more than half of the company’s revenue. He also noted the chip maker faces increased competition from            Advanced Micro Devices       (AMD) this year in the graphics chip market. Wong lowered his price target for the shares to $230 from $235. Nvidia stock was down 4.2% to $261.74 on Tuesday morning, while the S&P 500 was down 0.9%. The company declined to comment on the analyst report.Other Wall Street analysts are generally positive on Nvidia.

0,"Semiconductor stocks have soared over the past year in anticipation of a rebound for the sector. But Instinet analyst David Wong says the market may be misjudging the potential negative effects from the coronavirus outbreak on the chip industry. On Monday, equity markets fell after reports of further coronavirus infections outside of China, including in South Korea, Italy, and Iran.“While there has been a lot of attention on the supply chain disruptions associated with COVID-19, we think that many investors, and companies, may have underestimated the risk of the current issues impacting end market demand,” Wong wrote in a note to clients Sunday. “We remain cautious on the chip industry overall and selective in our chip and chip equipment stock picks.”The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor sector index, had risen more than 30% over the past year. On Monday, the ETF fell about 4%.The analyst noted how Analog Devices warned last week that the virus outbreak was affecting demand from its China-based industrial and automotive customers, while also slowing the rollout of 5G in China.Shares of chip makers            Micron Technology      (MU),            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) all declined more than 4% Monday.

AMD (ticker: AMD) makes processors that act as the main computing brains for personal computers, servers and graphics cards. The company’s stock has risen nearly 140% over the past year on anticipation of strong sales for its latest chip lineup.On Thursday, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers lowered his rating for AMD stock to Equal Weight from Overweight.“We’re positive on AMD’s competitive positioning and market share gain story,” he wrote. “However, at current levels, and based on our new sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis, we are downgrading…we see shares approaching levels that present a more balanced risk/reward.”AMD shares were down 0.2% to $58.81 Thursday morning, while the        Nasdaq Composite Index      was off less than 0.1%. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the analyst report.Rakers does predict that the company’s gross profit margins in its semi-custom segment, which makes chips for gaming consoles, will improve over the next few years. Both            Microsoft      (MSFT) and            Sony      (SNE) will use AMD’s chips for their new consoles in the 2020 holiday season.The analyst raised his price target for the stock to $64 from $55, but noted the lack of upside from current levels as the reason for his rating change.Other Wall Street analysts are generally mixed on AMD. Thirty-two percent have a Buy or Overweight rating on the company, according to FactSet.

All Rights ReservedIt has become so easy to make money in the stock market that the famous dart-throwing monkeys who have long beat human stockpickers have reportedly turned in their lanyards. In this era of low interest rates, anyone with an online trading account has a great chance at making money just by buying almost anything that moves. And incredibly, almost everyone gets to trade commission-free. Nothing, seemingly, can derail the bull—not even            Apple’s      (ticker: AAPL) recent warning that the coronavirus crisis in China would hurt future earnings. The        S&P 500      index remains near record highs. The semiconductor sector—which is a proxy for the economy because chips are in everything—is also at historic highs. Everything is so incredibly bullish that you could probably make loads of money just by rubbing your hands together and saying, “Abracadabra, give me some dosh.”The options market, which typically prices stocks as if the apocalypse started yesterday, is now pricing higher highs in the stock market. And in another reversal, call options are now generally more expensive than put options.Rather than bemoan this historic advance and tell you to hedge with inexpensive puts to protect gains, let’s focus on upside opportunities. Earnings season will soon end, and companies will begin hosting investor day, or analyst day, meetings. Many investors don’t know that these are legitimate trading opportunities because the events aren’t always advertised, and the Street tends to not make a big deal about them. But a            Goldman Sachs      study has found that the meetings consistently generate gains. Companies often offer greater details about operations, strategies, and financial outlooks at the meetings. The information is then reflected in analyst’s reports, and sometimes even in their earnings models and ratings. This creates a halo around the stock, and shares advance in expectation of a brighter future.Anyone who systematically bought calls on liquid U.S. stocks ahead of every investor day over the past 18 years had an average annual gain of 21% above costs, according to Goldman. So far this year, the strategy has returned 28%. The trading system is simple: Buy calls five days ahead of the event, and close calls one day after the event. John Marshall, a derivatives strategist at Goldman, recently told clients that the options market fails to sufficiently price the potential for volatility around these events. “Unlike earnings, which occur with a fixed quarterly frequency, analyst days can be held many years apart, making it difficult to employ a systematic trading strategy around these events. We believe this leads to relatively low option prices heading into the event, providing an edge to fundamental and generalist investors,” he wrote. Marshall advised his clients to focus on investor days as the next potential source of single stock volatility after earnings season. Option prices on single stocks have declined. One-month implied volatility on the average S&P 500 stock is at 22, down three points from January highs.Goldman told clients to focus on these investor day meetings:            Hasbro      (HAS) and            Mattel      (MAT) on Feb. 21;            Mimecast      (MIME) on Feb. 24;            Arconic      (ARNC),            Deluxe      (DLX), and            Freshpet      (FRPT) on Feb. 25;            Chevron      (CVX),            Keysight Technologies      (KEYS),            Lam Research      (LRCX), and            F5 Networks      (FFIV) on March 3;            Zendesk       (ZEN) and            Centene      (CNC) on March 4;            United Airlines      (UAL),            Exxon Mobil      (XOM), and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) on March 5;            Big Lots      (BIG) on March 9;            Alteryx       (AYX) and            Cerner      (CERN) on March 10;            Parker Hannifin      (PH) on March 12; and            Illinois Tool Works      (ITW) on March 13.

1," Two to One. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at all-time highs Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average did not. Still, investors looked past the coronavirus and let momentum carry the day. Tesla stock surged again and            Advanced Micro Devicesjumped on a report saying its chips might supplant            Intel      in            Apple      products. In today’s After the Bell, we...•...explain why the stock market rose on Monday;•...offer an alternative explanation;•...wonder about a mismatch in the market.If investors were worried that the market would follow through on Friday’s selling with more selling, they had nothing to worry about. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced      174.31 points, or 0.6%, to 29,276.82, while the        S&P 500      rose 0.7% today to 3352.09, and the        Nasdaq Composite      gained 1.13% to 9628.39. And yes, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit new highs.So what was the good news the market was reacting to? Some Chinese factories went back to work on Monday, though far more remained close. Still, progress is progress, and maybe the market will take what it can get.But maybe the market wasn’t responding to what happened today. Maybe it was responding to something that happened on Friday. “Remember that I said on Friday that if the market greets a strong jobs number with a decline, it usually comes to its senses after a day or so,” writes Todd Market Forecast’s Stephen Todd. “I believe that was the main reason for the rally on Monday.”Of course, we still have to deal with the fact that oil prices and Treasury yields continue to fall, a sign that the market might be worried about the economic impact of the coronavirus. “Despite the Nasdaq’s new all-time high, small-caps remained relatively weak and Treasury yields continued to fall, so risk assets might still not be out of the woods,” writes Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman. “Today’s mixed trends could be attributed to the cautiously optimistic coronavirus-related reports, but ‘under-the-hood’ we saw evidence of weakening participation in the rally, and that’s something that investors should keep an eye on.”Consider it done.

1,"Advanced Micro Devices stock tumbling after the chip maker reported earnings results that beat Wall Street estimates.AMD reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings per share of 32 cents, above the 31 cents Wall Street had expected. It posted revenue of $2.13 billion, beating the $2.11 billion analyst estimate.Guidance for the current quarter was slightly below what Wall Street anticipated at the midpoint of the range. AMD (ticker: AMD) forecasts a revenue range with a midpoint of $1.8 billion for the quarter ending in March, versus the average analyst estimate of $1.86 billion.“2019 marked a significant milestone in our multi-year journey as we successfully launched and ramped the strongest product portfolio in our 50-year history,” CEO Lisa Su said in the earnings release. “Our focused execution and the investments we made in our high-performance computing roadmaps position us well for continued growth in 2020 and beyond.”AMD stock was down 7.8% to $46.60 at 10:14 a.m. Wednesday.

0,"U.S. stock futures were pointing to modest gains on Tuesday, with investors hoping for a distraction from worrying coronavirus news via a big earnings roster that includes Apple.

Many of the stocks in his portfolio benefit from running operations out of the less-costly Midwest, and investors can sidestep currency conversions due to companies’ domestic focus.

Picking winners and losers in this environment might feel like a fool’s errand. But starting to sort through the sea of opportunity is a wise idea. To help stay engaged in this market, investors should embrace the power of the stock screen to find names with the right mix of factors for this moment. Even in good times, stock screens are one of the most useful tools an investor has. They can yield a funnel of new ideas, even if one shouldn’t buy a stock based on a screen alone. In calmer times, some investors look for faster-than-average growth, while others favor cheaper-than-average valuation multiples. In the Covid-19 storm, traditional screens look inadequate. Screening for multiple factors simultaneously will help. Using a mix is a little like two-factor authentication, which made the digital world far safer. As many remote workers can already attest, users enter passwords and then get texts or emails with confirmation codes. It reduces the chances for nasty surprises, such as identity theft. For our multifactor stock-authentication screen, we settled on a combination of cash flow, debt, earnings growth, and valuation. That would help us get rid of bargain stocks that were cheap for a reason, or avoid paying through the nose for fortress balance sheets. As a proxy for cash-flow stability, we looked for        S&P 500      companies that generated positive free cash flow in 2008 and 2009—during the financial crisis. Cash generating ability is at a premium again as Covid-19 dramatically slows the economy. We then kept only the companies with below-average debt and an absence of large, near-term debt maturities. Finally, we kept only those with below-average valuations and a demonstrated ability to grow earnings. In other words, we wanted a history of growth at a reasonable price.About 40 companies made the cut. Turning a stock screen into stock selection is more art than science. We took the relatively more attractive stocks across many sectors, and we looked for any additional catalysts that might boost stock performance down the road. Our final 12, in no particular order:            Caterpillar      (CAT),            Merck      (MRK),            UnitedHealth      (UNH),            Intel      (INTC),            Honeywell International      (HON),            Best Buy      (BBY),            W.W. Grainger      (GWW),            D.R. Horton      (DHI),            Qualcomm      (QCOM),            Akamai Technologies      (AKAM),            Lockheed Martin      (LMT),            BlackRock      (BLK). The dozen are down about 18% year to date, a little better than the drop of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      They have little debt, on average, and trade at a 25% discount to their own valuation history. And each has a story. Caterpillar makes diggers and dump trucks and bulldozers, huge machines ordered months in advance. It’s what is known as a long-cycle industrial business. Bank of America analyst Ross Gilardi cut his 2020 Cat earnings estimates Friday—the virus impacts everyone—but he noted the company had a strong balance sheet and a 4% dividend yield. Grainger is an industrial distributor, selling lots of small-ticket items that turn over quickly. The company, historically, has generated growth and cash flow in most economic environments, in part because it can swiftly scale operations up or down, depending on demand. It also sells a lot of safety products, like masks and cleaning solutions—items in high demand today. The stock trades for about 14 times estimated earnings, a discount to the broader market’s 15.8 times. Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, isn’t completely dependent on the health of the broader economy. And in the case of Merck and            UnitedHealth      —two health-care stocks—the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic front-runner has eliminated some of the political risk for the sector. Yes, this time is different. In the past 80 years, we’ve faced wars, banking crises, and recessions. We haven’t dealt with a global pandemic that threatens to grind the global economy to a halt. But even now, opportunities are revealing themselves. Investors just need a place to start.

1,"Heading into the coming December quarter earnings season, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish surveyed 35 “channel partners” on the state of the enterprise technology market. In a research note Wednesday, he writes that his biggest takeaway from the survey is that the picture looks better for software players than for hardware vendors. Fish, who does this exercise on a quarterly basis, found insights in the survey for multiple companies.Fish reports that the survey points to potential earnings upside for virtualization and cloud computing software company            VMware       (ticker: VMW), as well as for            Nutanix      (NTNX) and            Akamai Technologies      (AKAM). Nutanix provides hybrid cloud software, while Akamai is a content delivery network and one of Fishs top infrastructure picks. Fish’s other top infrastructure picks are            Cloudflare      (NET) and            RingCentral      (RNG). He adds that the survey results lead him to be incrementally more bullish on VMware, Zoom Video (ZM) and            Arista      Networks (ANET). The analyst, meanwhile, sees evidence of potential earnings misses at            Juniper      Networks (JNPR)—which makes networking hardware—as well as            NetScout      (NTCT) and            CommVault      (CMVLT). Netscout provides application and network performance management software, and CommVault provides data protection softwareAs a result of the survey, he is more cautious on Juniper and CommVault, along with            LogMeIn      (LOGM). He suggests a pair trade for investors of going long VMware and shorting Juniper (a bet that the stock will fall) ahead of quarterly results.Here are some brief company-specific comments from Fish based on the survey results: Write to Eric J.

1,"Senator Susan Collins recently disclosed that her husband, Thomas Daffron, made some stock trades in August.Specifically, the Maine Republican’s spouse bought            Akamai Technologies      stock (ticker: AKAM) and sold shares of            Covetrus      (CVET), an animal-health company.“Tom Daffron has no involvement in the purchase or sale of any of the stocks in his diversified portfolio,” Sen. Collins’ office said in a written response to a request for comment on Daffron’s trades. “These investment decisions are made exclusively by a third-party advisor.”Daffron’s account bought Akamai stock valued between $15,001 and $50,000 on Aug. 20, according to a form that Sen. Collins filed with the Secretary of the Senate. Specific values aren’t required for disclosure, only ranges. The stock of the cybersecurity firm has surged this year. Through Friday’s close, Akamai stock sports a year-to-date gain of 48.0%, more than twice the 20.0% rise in the        S&P 500.      Last year, both Akamai stock and the index slipped about 6%. Akamai stock has risen in 2019 on strong earnings as its focus on a “zero trust” approach to security seems to be paying off.This is the first transaction in Akamai stock for Daffron’s account this year. Another regulatory form that Sen. Collins filed earlier showed that Daffron didn’t own any Akamai stock at the end of 2018.Daffron didn’t own any Covetrus stock at the end of 2018, either. That’s because health-care supplier            Henry Schein      (HSIC) spun off Covetrus in February. Daffron owned Henry Schein stock valued between $15,001 and $50,000 at Dec. 31.Daffron’s account sold Covetrus stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000 on Aug. 15, his first transaction in the animal-health company’s shares, which may be playing dead. Covetrus stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value since closing at $46.19 on Feb. 6, its first day of trading publicly.The Wall Street Journal noted last month that the approval rating for Sen. Collins had turned net negative, an interesting development because she was re-elected in 2014 with 68% of the vote.Collins has said that she is confident she would win re-election in 2020, should she run again.

0,"In Economics 1, you learn how to draw supply and demand curves. One thing you discover is that price is tied to scarcity. When supply goes down, or demand goes up, prices rise. That’s the principle behind Uber’s surge pricing, and it helps explain a recent spike in            Fastly      stock.Founded in 2011 by CEO Artur Bergman, San Francisco-based Fastly (ticker: FSLY) calls itself an “edge cloud platform.” It includes a content delivery network, or CDN, with other services layered on top.Companies in the CDN business, like Fastly rival            Akamai Technologies      (AKAM), sit on the edge of the network and speed up access to web content and commerce sites. Companies can reach users faster if they serve up their websites from multiple places around the network, rather than one centralized spot. That is important for applications where speed matters, like video, say, or e-commerce, where long wait times often lead to abandoned shopping carts. Fastly adds additional services, such as security software and load balancing, to its CDN.Fastly shares have been swinging wildly since the company went public in May at $16 a share. The stock immediately spiked above $24, then ratcheted gradually back toward the initial public offering price. It recovered to the old highs in July, before sliding anew, this time below the IPO price, on slight disappointment with the company’s June quarter earnings. Since then? Oh my. As of mid morning, the stock had risen 93% in nine sessions, including Tuesday’s gain of $1.14, or 4.1%, to $28.70.Exactly what is going on is a little murky, and the company declined to comment on trading activity. But what seems clear is that there is not a lot of stock to buy, and the total is shrinking by the day.While Fastly has a little over 93 million shares outstanding, most of those are in the hands of insiders and venture investors. Most Fastly shares are still subject to the post-IPO lockup period, which expires in November. For the moment, only the 13 million shares sold in the IPO are available to trade.And that number is shrinking, thanks to Abdiel Capital, a New York-based investment firm that has been scooping up shares of Fastly with both fists. A few days after the IPO, Abdiel disclosed ownership of 1.8 million of the company’s class A shares, those that were issued in the IPO, via a 13-G filing, indicating a passive investment, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A few weeks later, the company converted that into a 13-D filing, which implies a more active investing posture.By last Friday, Abdiel’s stake had increased to 3.8 million shares. That is 29% of the float prior to the expiration of the lockup. In short, the supply of Fastly shares is shrinking, and that is driving up the price. In its 13-D filing, Abdiel wrote that the firm will keep tabs on Fastly’s “financial condition, business, operations and prospects, conditions in the securities markets, general economic and industry conditions and other factors,” and may engage in discussions with management and the board “about their investment, the business, operations, governance, strategy, capitalization, ownership and future plans of the Issuer and the management and board composition of the Issuer or commercial or strategic transactions.” Abdiel didn’t respond to a request for comment.The firm, by the way, is an aggressive tech investor that holds a small number of concentrated positions. The firm’s most recent 13-F disclosure, filed with the SEC earlier this month, shows just 10 positions, with the largest bets on            Alteryx      (AYX),            Shopify      (SHOP), and            Appian      (APPN).One other factor potentially contributing to the new focus on Fastly is a recent IPO filing by Cloudflare, another emerging player in the CDN market. Cloudflare got some unwanted publicity lately for hosting the bulletin-board website 8chan, used by suspects in various recent mass shootings, before pulling the plug. Piper Jaffray analyst James Fish, who recently began coverage of Fastly stock, wrote in a research note Monday that “a lack of available float is the culprit,” for the recent stock spike, “combined with upward pressure created by its largest shareholder, an overreaction to Q2 results, and a reasonable valuation.” He adds: “We continue to appreciate the fundamentals but expect further volatility in shares given the lack of float dynamic.”The interesting question is what will happen when the rest of the Fastly share base becomes tradable after the lockup expires in November.

0,"It’s always a little dangerous for analysts to do a sum-of-the-parts analysis. The approach leads to speculation of theoretical transactions that aren’t likely to happen. What would Amazon Web Services be worth as a stand-alone business? Or how much would the Apple App Store be worth on its own? And what if News Corp. spun off Barron’s? Piper Jaffray analyst James Fish Tuesday unveiled a detailed analysis on            Cisco Systems       (ticker: CSCO), and found—surprise!—that the parts are worth more than the whole. His base case found $244 billion in value at Cisco, which would be about $57 a share, suggesting nearly 20% upside for the stock. His calculation includes $101 billion for infrastructure platforms, $47 billion for applications, $37 billion for security, and another $50 billion for other stuff. The infrastructure calculation reflects $25 billion for campus switching, $40 billion for data-center switching and routing, $13 billion for software-defined wide-area networking, $18 billion for wireless, and $4.5 billion for servers and hyperconverged infrastructure. For applications, he counts $27 billion for collaboration software and $17 billion for AppDynamics, which Cisco bought in 2017 for what now appears to be a bargain price of $3.9 billion.Fish is quick to note that he is not advocating for a Cisco split up but instead asserts that the analysis supports a higher valuation for the stock and that recent multiple expansion is likely to continue as long as the “growth” segments can execute. He finds good risk-reward in the shares with the stock at the low end of his sum-of-the-parts range, which goes from $43 to $70. Fish has an Overweight rating on Cisco stock with a $55 target price.Fish also uses his note to engage in some speculation on potential M&A targets for the always-acquisitive networking giant. His list of potential deals is long, but he singles out companies as the best ideas for an “elephant-sized deal,” including            Splunk       (SPLK);            PagerDuty      (PD);            ServiceNow       (NOW); “an edge compute vendor” like            Akamai       (AKAM), Cloudflare (which just filed for an IPO), or            Fastly       (FSLY);            Sailpoint       (SAIL); privately held Exabeam, and            Nutanix      (NTNX).

1,"Blockchain technology, the software behind bitcoin, has been heralded as a potential trillion-dollar innovation. But investors have few ways to invest in the technology, which is still in its infancy and has attracted as many skeptics as proponents. There are multiple exchange-traded funds that hold companies that have made blockchain investments, but their actual exposure to the technology is minimal.What’s an investor to do? JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty has some ideas. Auty is optimistic about the technology. He thinks that “permissionless blockchain,” software like bitcoin that is open to anyone, is comparable to “the World Wide Web in 1998,” even if most businesses that currently use blockchain technology are “permissioned,” meaning they don’t allow public access. And in a report last week, he picked three stocks that could benefit from blockchain over the long term.Cloud infrastructure company            Akamai Technologies      (ticker: AKAM) could help companies run blockchain software as a service, Auty projects. In May, Akamai announced a partnership to build a blockchain-based payment network that the company says is designed to process more than 1 million transactions per second.DocuSign       (DOCU), meanwhile, makes electronic signature technology, and could also benefit from blockchain if the company digitizes the entire contracting process, Auty writes. The company already allows users to connect a blockchain to its system, he notes.Ellie Mae      (ELLI) a software company that processes mortgage applications, could also benefit, Auty writes. “Utilizing blockchain to manage the mortgage process could bring trust among parties and use of smart contracts could help automate various tasks,” he writes.JPMorgan may be bullish about these companies’ blockchain prospects, but it only has a buy rating (or Overweight) on two of them: Akamai and DocuSign. The firm has an Underweight rating on Ellie Mae.

0," The Wrong Kind of Throwback. Stocks closed lower across the board on Thursday, as all eyes turned to the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which had its biggest one-day move since the 2016 election—and touched at its highest level since 2011. In today’s After the Bell, we…   Yield Sign Stocks had a down day on Thursday, ending a streak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average that saw it reach its 15th record high for the year.The Dow lost 200.91 points, or 0.75%, to 26,627.48, while the S&P 500 lost 23.90 points, or 0.82%, to 2901.61 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 145.57 points, or 1.81%, to 7879.51. By now we know that bonds were behind today’s move lower, as investors fret about rapidly rising yields. But why now? Well, in a nutshell, investors were “surprised” by the bonds’ move and are worried about the dampening effect that interest rates may have on a bull market in its ninth year. (“Surprised” because markets ignored the yield’s gain Wednesday—and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hint on Tuesday that the central bank could finally move away from accommodative territory, after removing dovish language from the Fed statement last week.)Still, there are plenty of voices dismissing the rout. Yes, yields may have caught investors off guard, but the reason yields are going up is good, not bad. “Yields need to be higher—the economy is booming and money velocity has picked up,” writes Harris Financial Group’s Jamie Cox. “Yields are not going much higher, so folks can calm down and stop with the hysteria about rates torpedoing the economy.”Certainly, while rising interest rates can be a worry—in that they can rein in economic growth—higher Treasury yields aren’t always a bad sign. They can also occur when investors are optimistic about growth and equities, eschewing safe havens like U.S. government debt. Yet it’s the former scenario that has investors more worried at the moment.  Allianz Investment Management’s John Bredemus writes that the Fed will have to hike until real rates are between 1% and 1.5% to effectively manage inflation, which puts the fed-funds rate “very close to the Fed’s dots which is simply not priced into the market. Combined with uncertainty around how quickly the European Central Bank will remove accommodation, it doesn’t surprise us that the market is moving in the direction of the Fed’s view.”Yet he too argues that the Fed is reacting to a robust economy, one that can still support more stock gains. Inflation and wage increases are raising businesses’ costs, but better productivity and a strong consumer (who can absorb the pass-through of higher input costs) can offset these drags. “Today’s equity pull back is probably a reaction to the speed of the rate increase and the uncertainty around how far it will go but generally rates need to go up much higher to have a longer term negative impact on equities,” Bredemus writes.Plus, we just finished a third quarter in which the Dow rose 9%—a little bit of a pause isn’t that shocking. As Plancorp’s Peter Lazaroff notes, during postwar bull markets, the S&P 500 has seen a pullback of 5% to 9.9% once a year, a correction of 10.0% to 19.9% every 2.8 years, and a bear market decline of at least 20% every 4.7 years. By that metric, we’ve already avoided a fair bit of pain. “Investors must be willing to lose money on occasion to earn the average long-term return that attracts most people to stocks in the first place,” he writes.Nor was the U.S. the only market suffering from the Treasury yield’s rise, as the selloff reverberated around the world. It’s the year’s market movement in microcosm: The U.S. may be rocking the boat, but benefiting from a safe-haven reputation, it never gets as doused as much other nations. “Higher yields aren’t all doom and gloom for stocks,” writes TD Ameritrade’s JJ Kinahan, as the U.S. market “has been doing well despite the rate hikes we’ve seen and expectations for future interest rate rises. If that trend continues, we could see money shift into U.S. stocks and bonds at the expense of some overseas markets.”Heads we win, tails, they lose.  The Hot Stock Constellation Brands shot to the top of the S&P 500, following its beat-and-raise second quarter.Constellation climbed $11.34, or 5.4%, to $222.10. The alcohol and spirits maker earned $2.87 a share on revenue of $2.3 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.61 on revenue of $2.25 billion. For the full year, it sees earnings per share of $9.60 to $9.75, up from a prior range of $9.40 to $9.70, and above the $9.44 consensus estimate.A strong showing from Constellation’s beer business and higher sales of pricier wines helped drive the robust results.Constellation is down 2.8% year to date, although it’s risen 10.4% in the past 12 months. The top five stocks in the S&P 500 Constellation Brands: 5.4%Eli Lilly      (LLY): 4%Jefferies Financial Group      (JEF): 3.1%Cabot Oil & Gas      (COG): 3%CME Group      (CME): 2.9% The Biggest Loser  Coty (COTY) sank to the bottom of the index, on worries that Chinese tourists won’t be able to load up on its products abroad.Coty lost $1.03, or 8.3%, to $11.45.

1," Monday Motivation. Stocks were tiptoeing higher to start the week , following Europe’s lead, although as always, shadows of trade worries lingered in the background, highlighted by a presidential tweet. In today’s Morning Movers we… • Review the latest tweet tumult; • Discuss ongoing market worries, and; • Take a look at Tesla’s move upward.  September Shakes Stocks looked prepared to shake off last week’s losses Monday, as all three indexes had their noses pointed higher as the market opened.Dow Jones Industrial Average futures and the S&P 500 futures were both up 0.4% and Nasdaq Composite futures were 0.3% higher. Yet as always, it doesn’t take long to chip away at the calm and reveal worry. Monday, trade was again the bugaboo, with            Apple      (AAPL) suppliers tumbling following a weekend tweet from the White House arguing that the tech giant should move production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs.That’s not particularly welcome news, given that tech has been such a weak spot of late. While U.S. stocks are shrugging it off for now (as they have been prone to do when it comes to trade-related worries lately), it’s worth noting that emotion continues to creep into the market as jitters remain. “Trade wars, weakness in tech, and contagion risk from emerging markets offset another week of solid fundamental data,” writes Piper Jaffray’s Craig Johnson, speaking of last week’s move downward for stocks. While the fundamental narrative remains in place, he’s concerned that “concerns over trade wars, contagion risk from weakening foreign markets, and a flattening yield curve cannot be ignored,” meaning that “September may live up to its bad reputation.”Alas, it seems like only last month that we were toasting new highs for the S&P 500. That’s because it was last month: On Aug. 24, the index closed at 2784.69, which, as CFRA’s Sam Stovall notes, allowed it to recover all of the 10.2% that it lost during the correction in January and February. Yet the recovery took 197 days, longer than previous bounces, leading yet again to worries about the aging bull market. Stovall thinks that the S&P 500 can make a run at 3000 by the end of the year, but that the rally may not be the gift that keeps on giving. “We advise investors not to think this accelerated appreciation will continue well into the New Year. Indeed, we project the S&P to trade around 3100 a year from now, implying a sub-standard price increase in the coming 12 months, as the benefits of tax and corporate profit tailwinds subside,” he writes.While that may sound like a downer, what a difference a decade makes. Just about ten years ago, we were staring down the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Yet, as we approach the anniversary, DataTrek’s Nicholas Colas writes that while Lehman’s collapse may be the only thing we remember, it was hardly an island of trouble. “The reality about 2008 is that the US was on track to see a recession regardless of what happened with Lehman. Oil prices had doubled from June 2007 to the same month in 2008 and sat at $140/barrel. That’s exactly the sort of spike that always drives a US (and usually global) economic slowdown.” We may only talk about the financial crisis today, forgetting the rest, but the “truth is that the global economy was already on very shaky ground.”Therefore, today’s ongoing strong fundamentals may be overwhelmed by negative headlines, but they’re a reminder that we’re still in a much better position than many think.  Morning Movers Akamai Technologies      (AKAM) is up 2.2% to $76.18 after D.A. Davidson upgraded it to Buy.Novartis      (NVS) is up 1.2% to $82.72 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded it to Buy. Snap      (SNAP) is down 1.3% to $9.80 after its chief strategy officer resigned. Tesla      (TSLA) is up 3.2% to $271.65 after CEO Elon Musk outlined management changes and said that the company is “about to have the most amazing quarter in our history.”UnitedHealth Group      (UNH) is down 0.8% to $266.05 after Citi downgraded it to Neutral.

0," Several names are reporting earnings in the after-market:  Instructure (INST), the cloud-based maker of software for classrooms, reported revenue of $47.99 million and a loss of 21 cents, narrowly beating the consensus estimates for revenue of $47 million and a loss of 23 cents a share. The company’s forecast for this quarter calls for revenue of $49.1 million to $49.7 million and a loss of 25 cents to 27 cents, which is a little lighter on the top line compared to the average $50 million estimate.The stock is up 5 cents at $40.60 in late trading, perhaps not surprising given it is among cloud stocks that, as I wrote earlier, have already surged this year, raising expectations.Another cloud name is Apptio (APTI), the maker of finance applications that went public in October. It reported revenue up 23%, at $54.1 million, and breakeven on the profit line, which was better than consensus estimates for revenue of $51.6 million and a loss of 6 cents per share.The forecast is also higher, with revenue this quarter seen at $55 million to $56 million, versus $53 million expected. The full-year forecast is for revenue of $225 million to $230 million, higher than the average of $223 million.Shares are up $1.49, or 5%, at $31.Shares of bandwidth provider Akamai (AKAM) are up $1.95, or 2.7%, at $73.60, in late trading after the company comfortably beat Q1 expectations, reporting $669 million in revenue and EPS of 79 cents versus consensus estimates for revenue of $654 million and EPS of 70 cents.We have to wait until the call to know the forecast for this quarter.

0,"Shares of Internet bandwidth and applications provider Akamai Technologies (AKAM) are up $1.77, or almost 3%, at $65.44, despite the market’s wobbly session, following a report of better-than-expected Q4 results yesterday afternoon, and an upbeat outlook.There are no ratings changes today, that I can see, but several price target increases, going up into the $80 range.In a phone call a short while ago, CEO Tom Leighton described to me the ways the company continues to diversify away from its traditional business as a “CDN,” when it was mostly known for helping Netflix (NFLX) and others push bandwidth-heavy video to viewers.“The major platform companies now represent around 8% of our revenue, which is a big change from years past when it was more like 20%,” he said.Helping that diversification is the move into providing security tools for both public cloud computing operations and for enterprise security. The security business was up 32% in the quarter. The portion that is for enterprises to use on-premise is “just getting started,” he says.Leighton’s priorities for this year “are focusing on growth, improving margins, continuing to turn around the media business, and advancing these new product areas were we’ve had terrific success, like security.On the Street, both bull and bear are hiking targets, though bears continue to believe the business is structurally challenged: Michael Olson, Piper Jaffray: Reiterates an Overweight rating, and raises his price target to $78 from $59. The mix shift towards higher margin performance & security continued on a y/y basis; P&S was 62.7% of revenue in Q417, up ~300bps from 59.6% in Q416. Guidance for Q118 was above consensus (revenue guide 1% and EPS 10% above) as the company expects Media Delivery to continue to rebound and EBITDA margin to remain stable q/q. If the companys visibility into the media delivery business has, in fact, improved and the fundamentals of that segment are becoming more favorable, investors would likely be willing to assign a higher multiple to AKAM shares. Brad Melnick, Credit Suisse: Reiterates an Outperform rating, and rises his price target to $78 from $75. Possibly inspired by Elliott Management’s 13D filing in December, the company has embarked on several initiatives that are expected to drive better performance through 2018. Apart from operating improvements, we continue to believe Akamai’s edge network is convertible into something far more valuable over time, in security and beyond ... We note March 8th is the final day to nominate Board candidates for election and expect Elliott to crystalize its strategy over the course of the next month, perhaps including an update on the alleged strategic review process, as reported by Bloomberg. Colby Synesael, Cowen & Co.: Reiterates a Market Perform rating, and raises his price target to $64 from $59. The company reported solid 4Q17 results and we applaud the company for taking a fresh look at its cost structure and its overall Media strategy. That said, we continue to view an outright sale of the company as unlikely and while we admit we missed the run, we believe stock is now priced appropriately. Greg Miller, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Reiterates a Hold rating, and raises his target to $70 from $60. Despite a solid beat – even excluding an FX tailwind –better-than-expected 1Q guidance and confidence in momentum, full-year revenue guidance is roughly in line with our prior estimates and consensus. While conservatism is likely and projecting enough confidence in a business that has historically been challenged by lack of visibility to provide annual guidance is positive, some might have expected more aggressive guidance. Brandon Nispel, KeyBanc Capital: Reiterates an Underweight rating, and raises his target to $57 from $51. Bulls received the cost reductions they wanted, but bears will continue to point to what else can be done. We view the business as structurally challenged and would not be paying above historical average multiples for a company with below historical average growth and margin profiles.Shares of Internet bandwidth and applications provider Akamai Technologies (AKAM) are up $1.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved Here are some things going on today in your world of tech:The market opened shaky, the Nasdaq slipping 21 points but quickly rallying, and is now up 17 points at 7,133.36. Amazon.com (AMZN) is on pace to close above Microsoft (MSFT) for the first time ever, with a market cap of $706 billion or so, versus $697 billion for Microosft, according to the data gurus at Dow Jones. That would make Amazon the new No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization. Snap assessment  Snap (SNAP) is one of the stand-out gainers, rising $4.69, or 33%, to $18.75, following yesterday afternoon’s surprise Q4 beat, and a better-than-expected rise in daily average users.THe stock has gotten at least five upgrades this morning, from Merrill Lynch, SunTrust, Susquehanna, JP Morgan, Evercore ISI, and RBC Capital.RBC’s Mark Mahaney, raising his rating to Outperform from Sector Perform, and raising his price target to $21 from $15, writes that this is the “reacceleration and inflection” that he thought might come later this year. He thinks it’s sustainable, thanks to an improvement in the Android version of the app, the transition of Snap’s ad business to an auction model, and the company slowing its employee growth, keeping operating expenses in check.The enthusiasm is spreading to other parts of social media. Twitter (TWTR) shares are up $1.10, or 4.3%, at $26.34, after Deutsche Bank’s Lloyd Walmsley raised his price target on the shares to $22 from $18, while reiterating a Hold rating, writing that he’s hearing improved feedback from ad buyers, and seeing better user trends in comScore data. Earnings results mostly gainers Among other earnings gainers this morning, Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is up $3.27, or 5%, at $66.94, after yesterday afternoon’s Q4 beat and higher Q1 forecast. Ultimate Software (ULTI) and Zendesk (ZEN) are both up sharply today, 7% and 8%, respectively, after yesterday afternoon’s reports prompt multiple price-target increases.Another winner is Match Group (MTCH), makers of the “Tinder” dating app, as well as Match.com. Its shares are up $2.71, or 8%, at $35.97, after it reported Q4 revenue and Ebitda beat expectations, and it forecast revenue for this quarter above consensus, at $380 million to $390 million, versus the average estimate for $365 million. New Relic (NEWR) is building on yesterday’s gains, up $3.83, or 7%, at $63.13, and for a moment up 9%, after the company beat fiscal Q3 revenue expectations and delivered its first quarterly profit, a surprise for the Street, and forecast this quarter’s results higher as well, sending its stock higher in late trading.Among this morning’s reports, Cognizant Software Technologies (CTSH) is up $4.81, or 6.5%, at $78.71, after the company reported Q4  revenue just a hair above consensus, at $3.83 billion, and beat by 7 cents on the bottom line. The forecast for this quarter is also higher, for both revenue and profit. Cognizant said it will buy back $1.2 billion of its shares this year.Among the losers is Microchip Technology (MCHP), after yesterday blaming its Atmel business for warping its March-quarter outlook.There are several bulls stepping up to defend the stock, but SunTrust Robinson Humphrey’s William Stein, reiterating a Hold rating, writes that it confirms a more abrupt industry-wide slowdown is at hand - as we warned in Dec. Goldman wants to fund your iPhone  Goldman Sachs (GS) is looking to expand its consumer banking effort by financing purchases of Apple (AAPL) gear, according to an article this morning by Peter Rudegeair and Liz Hoffman in The Wall Street Journal, citing multiple unnamed sources. Purchasers of an iPhone, for example, could get a loan from Goldman instead of putting it on a credit card. The talks between the two companies for the effort are ongoing and “could still fall apart,” the authors write. Infinera, Synaptics on tap On tap for earnings this afternoon, after the closing bell, are Infinera (INFN), Inphi (IPHI), Limelight Networks (LLNW), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Synaptics (SYNA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO), Yelp (YELP), Zayo Group (ZAYO), and Zynga (ZNGA).An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedStocks look set for a lower open this morning as bears once again have the upper hand. S&P 500 futures imply a 0.6% fall at the open, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures imply a drop 197.77 points, or 0.8%. Nasdaq Composite futures imply a 0.6% decline.We took a look at what’s been responsible for selloff and the pickup in volatility, with issues ranging from potential inflation, higher bonds yields and valuations. What’s been interesting though is how little has actually changed. Bond yields are higher, but not much higher, and the 10-year is trading at 2.78% this morning, off of Friday’s high.The folks at Pavilion argue that rates haven’t moved enough to cause a selloff in stocks. “The current episode has not been directly a rates-induced selloff,” they wrote today. “If this were the case, we would have seen the interest rate-sensitive sectors underperform broader equity indices severely, which was not the case.”But fear of higher rates--and the impact it would have on valuations--is very real. If the ten-year yield rises by a percentage point, then the equity risk premium, by definition, would have to drop by a percentage point. Until the market feels comfortable with where rates are headed--and the valuations that implies for stocks--don’t expect the volatility to end.   Morning Movers    Earnings  Akamai Technologies      (AKAM) has climbed 7% to $68.10 after reporting an adjusted fourth-quarter profit of 69 cents a share, in line with analyst forecasts, on sales of $663.5 million, also meeting expectations. Akamai also said it would earn between 67 and 70 cents during the first quarter, ahead of forecasts for 61 cents.Chipotle (CMG) has slumped 9.4% to $275.71 after reporting an adjusted profit of $1.34 a share, beating forecasts for $1.32 a share, on sales of $1.11 billion that met analyst forecasts. “Given what we see as a “new norm” of mid-single-digit unit growth, low-single-digit same-store sales (SSS) and a high-teens restaurant-level margin – we view CMG’s premium valuation as increasingly challenging to justify,” says Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Farmer.Gilead Sciences      (GILD) has fallen 1.7% to $79.00 after reporting a profit of $1.78 a share, beating forecasts for $1.67 a share, on sales of $5.95 billion ahead of estimates for $5.71 billion. Gilead said it would produce sales of $20 billion to $21 billion in 2018, below forecasts for $21.94 billion. “Results confirm our thesis that GILD is an attractive turn-around story,” writes Jefferies analyst Michael Yee.Hasbro      (HAS) has slumped 6.8% to $87.56 after reporting a profit of $2.30 a share, beating estimates for $1.80, on sales of $1.6 billion, below forecasts for $1.7 billion. “ HAS shares likely trade lower on significant revenue, operating earnings miss and Europe inventory issues,” writes Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Conder.Michael Kors (KORS) has jumped 8.2% to $70.80 after reporting better-than-expected earnings and sales. “Big 3Q beat provides evidence of improving product innovation and operational execution,” writes MKM’s Roxanne Meyer.Snap (SNAP) has surged 22% to $17.14 after reporting a loss of 28 cents a share, beating forecasts a 33-cent loss, on sales of $285.7 million, ahead of analysts forecasts for $254.8 million. “We did not hear any commentary nor observe any data which causes us to meaningfully alter longer-term variables in our model,” says Pivotal Research’s Brian Wieser, who rates Snap a Sell.Walt Disney      (DIS) has risen 1.8% to $108.08 after reporting a profit of $1.89 a share on sales of $15.35 billion. Analysts had been predicting earnings of $1.61 a share on revenue of $15.5 billion. “Still, the F1Q18 earnings release showed stronger than expected performance across multiple divisions, with the Media Networks more than making up for a topline shortfall with better than expected margins,” writes Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant.Wynn Resorts      (WYNN) has climbed 8.6% to $177.20 after CEO Steve Wynn resigned. “We think this separation reduces WYNN (the company’s) negative regulatory risk outcomes meaningfully (not to zero, but a great deal, in our view, with respect to license suitability/revocation risk in NV, MA and Macau as well as other potential negative outcomes in Macau),” writes            JPMorgan’s      Joseph Greff, who upgraded Wynn’s shares to Overweight from Neutral.  Upgrades & Downgrades  Cleveland-Cliffs      (CLF) has gained 4.6% to $7.07 after getting upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at            Credit Suisse.Cboe Global Markets      (CBOE) has dropped 4.7% to $111.50 after getting cut to Neutral from Buy at            Goldman Sachs      and to Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan.Spirit Airlines      (SAVE) has risen 2.4% to $41.38 after getting upgraded to Outperform from In-Line at Imperial Capital and to Outperform from Neutral at Macquarie.Charles Schwab      (SCHW) has fallen 2.4% to $51.60 after getting cut to Sell from Neutral at            Citigroup.Intercept Pharmaceuticals      (ICPT) has slumped 4.6% to $58 after getting cut to Sell from Neutral at Goldman Sachs.  The View From Silicon Valley  As the stock market whipsawed its way through a triple-digit swing on Tuesday, Elon Musk ended the day with a bang while Meg Whitman’s era at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (            HP      E) is ending quietly.SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket roared into the sky from Kennedy Space Center in a fiery display both symbolic and showy. Carrying a payload that included Musk’s red Tesla roadster playing David Bowie’s Space Oddity, it marked the first successful launch of the 1,500-ton rocket with 27 engines – roughly the size of three Falcon 9 boosters glued together – after five years of delays.For Musk, it’s a significant step in his dream to colonize Mars, though he had his worries yesterday: He pegged the chances of Falcon Heavy exploding at 50% shortly before the successful launch.Back to Earth and across the country, there were no fireworks at HPE, which is in the midst of moving its headquarters to Santa Clara, south of its place of origin in Palo Alto. Whitman, who is retiring this month after nearly seven years as HPE’s Chief Executive Officer,In the end, she faced the same impossible task as former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer: Turn around a listless corporate behemoth whose best years were behind it.And, like Mayer, Whitman eventually left after delivering mixed results. They competed in a world of            Facebook      (FB),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others that left it in the technological dust.Whitman inherited an aging, troubled company when she joined HP in 2011, and she was forced to slash jobs and break up the company. Contrast that with her previous tech stop,            eBay      (EBAY), where she led it during the dawn of the commercial Internet and became a billionaire as a result.The juxtaposition of Musk and Whitman, odd as it may be, offers an ongoing lesson to be learned from Silicon Valley: Fortunes rise and fall quickly here. Innovation has a short memory.  -- Jon Swartz  Email:  editors@barrons.com Stocks look set for a lower open this morning as bears once again have the upper hand.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"As U.S. stocks continue to set record highs led by the fastest-growing companies, growth stocks have trounced value in recent years. With the bull market over a decade old and valuations toward the high end of their historical range, many have called for a comeback in value investing.Growth stocks are most simply defined as those that are expected to increase their earnings or revenues at a faster rate than the rest of the market. Value stocks are those that trade at a discount to the market on various fundamental measures.But why choose one strategy when you can have both? Barron’s decided to look for stocks in the        S&P 500      that exhibit characteristics often sought out by both growth and value investors. They’re cheap on one key metric, but also expected to increase earnings faster than their peers this year. Read Next: These Are the 100 Most Sustainable Companies in AmericaThe index’s average free cash flow yield—a measure of return—is currently 3.7%. Analysts also expect the S&P 500 to grow earnings per share by 8.1% in 2020. Here are the dozen stocks in the S&P 500 that are at least 75% more attractive than the index on both metrics.Source: FactSet, BloombergPerhaps unsurprisingly, a pair of energy companies top the list:            Valero Energy      (ticker: VLO) and            Marathon Petroleum      (MPC). The sector is coming off a tough year with a persistently low oil price that’s weighed on many companies’ performances. That’s caused investors to avoid the sector, and made the stocks cheap. Marathon’s free cash flow is almost 12% of its market value, while Valero’s is almost 11%.While many oil and gas stocks are unlikely to see an upswing without a higher oil price, analysts are confident about rebounds at Valero and Marathon—to the tune of 82% and 62% earnings per share growth, respectively. Both recently raised their dividends. Barron’s suggested that investors should have some exposure to energy companies in their portfolios earlier in February.Bristol-Myers Squibb      (BMY) stock has been held back by merger controversy over much of the past year. Its shares tumbled in early January after it announced that it would be acquiring the biotech firm Celgene. Investors took some time to come around to the deal, which closed in late 2019. At the stock’s current level it yields almost double the free cash flow of the S&P 500 index. Analysts see several promising drug projects at the newly combined company, and expect earnings per share to jump 43% in 2020.Qualcomm      (QCOM) stock has had its share of headwinds including limits on business with Huawei, an antitrust investigation in Europe, and most recently supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus in China. But analysts are bullish on the company’s opportunities in the shift to next-generation 5G networks. The stock’s free cash flow yield is at a healthy 6.5%, and Wall Street expects 22.2% earnings per share growth this year.General Motors      (GM) has long traded at an alluringly cheap multiple. But this one could simply be a value trap. There has been little appetite for traditional auto makers like GM.            Tesla       (TSLA) captures all the electric-vehicle enthusiasm, while tech players like            Alphabet’s      (GOOGL) Waymo unit are way ahead on autonomous-driving capabilities. GM is making an effort in both future areas, but investors have proven skeptical of the company’s long-term prospects—even at its current 15% free cash flow yield and with earnings per share forecast to rise 28% in 2020.Other stocks with potential value and growth appeal include            H&R Block       (HRB),            State Street      (STT),            Alliance Data Systems      (ADS), and            Anthem      (ANTM).

0,"Shares in            Publicis      Groupe rose as much as 4% on Thursday after the world’s third biggest advertising group by sales confirmed its outlook for 2020. But challenges remain as clients continue to cut ad spending amid competition from Facebook and Alphabet’s Google. The back story. The French ad giant behind marketing campaigns for companies including Coca-Cola (KO) and            L’Oréal      (LRLCY) has had a challenging year as clients tighten their budgets in a tough economic environment. It lowered its guidance twice in 2019.Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun has been trying to offset the fall in traditional ad spending by reorganizing the business, including investing heavily in data capabilities and technology as spending moves online. In July, it paid $4.4 billion to buy Epsilon, the marketing-services company, from            Alliance Data Systems. Whats new. Publicis (PUB.France), which competes against bigger rivals            WPP      (WPP) and            Omnicom      Group (OMC), recorded an 8.5% decline in net profit to €841 million (about $923 million) in the year ended December 31. This was on revenues of €9.8 billion, up 9.3% over the period, compared with €9 billion in 2018. The company confirmed its earlier outlook for 2020 organic sales growth, saying its underlying sales would evolve in the range of -2% and +1%. It also continues to target an operating margin rate of around 17%, driven by the reorganization and new sources of revenue.Shares in Publicis, which have fallen by nearly 30% in the past year, were trading 3.06% higher at €41.37 at 12:30 GMT. Looking Ahead. Sadoun’s strategy of fending off competition from tech giants, as well as consulting firms like            Accenture      (ACN), by focusing on data analytics is starting to work. The French group has scored a series of big mandates including Walt Disney (DIS), Swiss drugmaker            Novartis      (NVS) and snacks company            Mondelez International      (MDLZ) and can now offer them technological tools on top of traditional creative marketing campaigns. For now, that seems enough to have convinced analysts at UBS to assign a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of €44.00. Shares in Publicis Groupe rose as much as 4% on Thursday after the world’s third biggest advertising group by sales confirmed its outlook for 2020.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      fell, dragged lower by discouraging news from 3M, but the other major U.S. stock-market indexes were higher as investors assessed a flood of news about corporate earnings.The Dow lost 49 points, or 0.2%.

0," Monday Malaise. U.S. stocks lost ground, if only just, with all three major market indexes finishing the day in the red. A mixed bag of earnings results from the likes of Citigroup and Goldman Sachs left investor unenthused as they await for updates on U.S.-China trade negotiations. Earnings from Johnson & Johnson and Bank of America will in focus Tuesday morning. In today’s After the Bell, we...•...build a wall of worry;  •...highlight Anthem’s market-leading gain;  •...and explain why Alliance Data Systems was the worst performer in the S&P 500. When the market stops moving, it is always fair to wonder what it is waiting for—and the answer might not be what investors want to hear. On Monday, the        S&P 500      declined 0.1% to 2905.58, while the        Dow Jones Industrial Average,      dipped 27.53 points, or 0.1%, to 26384.77, and the        Nasdaq Composite      slipped 0.1% to 7976.01. It was the S&P 500’s seventh day with a move of 0.35% or less during the first 12 trading days of April, though the index is still up more than 2.5% this month. The fact that the S&P 500 has been chipping its way higher isn’t making everyone feel good, however. Take Jefferies strategist Sean Darby, who lowered his rating on U.S. stocks to Modestly Bearish within the firm’s global asset allocation. Darby doesn’t think the U.S. is headed for a recession, but worries about what the market will look like if the global economy actually does recover. “The predicament we and other investors might face in the latter part of 2Q is that the U.S. and global economy improves, leaving share prices already ‘appearing’ expensive,” he writes. So with the S&P 500 hitting his 2900 target, it was time for a downgrade.He’s not the only one starting to get worried. The market’s rally from its December lows has been driven, in part, by a shift in Federal Reserve policy expectations, as the central bank went from planning more hikes to planning none. The market, however, is pricing in a 42% chance of a rare cut, writes Wolfe Research’s Chris Senyek, and that is just too high. “Our sense is that the odds of a cut this year are very low and it is closer to 50/50 as to whether or not the FOMC remains on hold or raises the fed funds rate by 25bps,” he explains. “Further, if the global growth outlook improves in the months ahead, expectations for the ECB to resume asset purchases later in the year are likely to fade as well.”Remember, never fight the Fed.Anthem      (ANTM) climbed to the top of the S&P 500 on Monday, along with other health care stocks.Anthem gained 4% to $262.88. Health stocks like Anthem had a painful run last week, despite a lack of specific news. However, the last shall be first, and today investors were buying back into the group following the selloff. Along with Anthem,            UnitedHealth Group      (UNH) and            Cigna      (CI) were among the index’s better performers.In the past 12 months, Anthem is up 18%.—Teresa RivasAlliance Data Systems      (ADS) slipped to the bottom of the index, following news of an asset sale.Alliance Data Systems lost 9.3% to $164.04 on Monday.The company said it would sell its Epsilon business for $4.4 billion to            Publicis Groupe      (PUBGY), with the proceeds going toward stock buybacks and debt reduction.

1," Midday Rally. The S&P 500 fell for a fifth session in a row on Wednesday, and the stock market is still contemplating what to do with the current mixed bag of news. After some early-morning losses on Thursday, the index rallied as investors focused on the positive: reports that China is offering trade concessions to the U.S., and October retail-sales figures that showed growing strength. In today’s Intraday Update, we......Look at a winner today that has been losing for the week; ...And wonder which tech stocks’ selloffs stem from fundamentals, and which don’t. Tech Is Not One Word Tech has been the best-performing sector on Thursday, with the        Technology Select Sector SPDR      exchange-traded fund (ticker: XLK) up 1.4% in early afternoon, compared with the        S&P 500’s      0.7% rise. That’s why the        Nasdaq Composite      is Thursday’s star among the three major indexes, scoring a 1.3% gain as the other two managed smaller gains.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was up 0.5%, to 25197, while the S&P 500 gained 0.9%.However, technology stocks are still underwater for the week. The Technology Select ETF was down 4.6% week to date as of Wednesday’s close, compared with the S&P 500’s 2.9% loss.            NetApp      (NTAP),            Apple      (APPL), and            Alliance Data Systems      (ADS) have had some of the biggest losses.To be sure, the recent pullback hasn’t wiped out the annual outperformance for most stocks in the sector, which is still up 5.5% for the year versus 1% for the S&P 500. On an equal-weighted basis, tech has increased 6.5%. What many investors don’t realize, however, is that underneath the concept of “tech,” there are vast differences in how companies should be viewed and treated, says Tom Essaye from Sevens Report. If you ask most Technology Select owners what stocks are in the fund, many probably think of the FAANGs. The fact is,            Amazon.com      (AMZN) and            Netflix      (NFLX) were never tech stocks,            Facebook      (FB) and            Alphabet      (GOOGL) are already out of the portfolio, and Apple makes up less than 20% of the fund. For all of the other stocks, people need a better understanding. “There is differential between the tech hardware companies versus Apple and            Microsoft,      ” explains Essaye. “To paint tech with one broad brush is kind of an oversight.” Apple shares were down 7.1% for this week this morning, at least partly because its suppliers noted weaker demand for components, leading people to worry about softer iPhone sales. Facebook and Alphabet, although some don’t consider them tech stocks anymore, are facing regulation risk over data privacy. Facebook was down 21.1% over the past three months, and Alphabet had lost 14.4%. Semiconductor stocks are getting hammered lately, as well, but that’s largely due to oversupply issues instead of demand concerns. Semiconductor stocks within the S&P 500 have declined 9.5% over the past three months. On the other hand, in another offshoot of tech, there has been some bullish sentiment about 5G and communications technology.A recent report from            Morgan Stanley      highlighted some stocks where selloffs have probably been driven by macro market factors and secular tailwinds, rather than fundamentals. It might give tech investors some guidance. Within the semiconductor industry, Morgan Stanley says, there are            Intel      (INTC),            Xilinx      (XLNX), and            Nvidia      (NVDA). Among software companies, there are Microsoft (MSFT),            Adobe      (ADBE), and            Salesforce.      com (CRM). And in the internet world, there are Alphabet,            Expedia      (EXPE),            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO), and            Twitter      (TWTR).

0,"In the latest signs of trouble in the tech supply chain, the electrical connector manufacturer            Amphenol      on Monday warned that it won’t meet its original guidance for 2020 sales and adjusted earnings per share for the March quarter due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus outbreak in China. The company said that the uncertainty around when it can return to full production in China and a lack of visibility on demand from China customers make it impossible quantify the specific impact on its business.Amphenol’s (ticker: APH) announcement echoes the cautions comments last week from its client            Apple      (AAPL), which a week ago warned that a combination of supply chain and demand issues tied to the virus would make it impossible to hit previous guidance.“We are experiencing a slower return to normal business conditions than we originally anticipated, resulting from the limited availability of our workforce and supplier constraints, together with reduced demand from customers within China who have not yet returned to expected production levels,” Amphenol CEO R. Adam Norwitt said in a statement. “As of today, all of our China operations have reopened and more than 60% of our China-based employees have returned to work, despite ongoing significant restrictions on movement within China. Outside of China, customer demand remains in line with our expectations. Our company continues to be fundamentally strong, and we believe that this disruption to our China-related business is only temporary.”Citi analyst Jim Suva points out in a research note Monday that Amphenol generated about 30% of revenue from customers in China, and that it gets a “high-single-digit” percentage of revenue from Apple, so the announcement is not that surprising. Suva, who has a Buy rating and $115 target price on Amphenol shares, thinks sales lost in the March quarter are likely to be recouped in subsequent quarters. “We believe that the demand issue is transitory in nature and that Amphenol should be able to ramp up capacity quickly” as workers return to the company’s factories in China.There should be more commentary on supply chain issues later Monday, when            HP      (HPQ) reports January quarter financial results, with further data points on Thursday when            Dell Technologies      (DELL) reports January quarter results.Adding to the investor jitters on the tech supply chain, Samsung temporarily shut down production at one of its factories on Sunday after one of its workers was diagnosed with the virus.Amphenol shares on Monday are down 4.1%, to $97.59.

0,"The world’s second-largest economy has ground to a virtual halt as China grapples with the deadly coronavirus. Nearly 60 million people have been quarantined, and stores and production lines are still largely shut. Even once the virus is contained, side effects will linger for many companies. The outbreak has infected more than 60,000 people and killed more than 1,300, inflicting an unquantifiable wave of suffering. When it comes to companies, the pain isn’t limited to those heavily reliant on China for sales or that operate facilities in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.The city is a center for auto, electronics-component, and semiconductor production, but it’s also a transport hub—much like Chicago—making it even more crucial to the global supply chain. The takeaway: Disruptions could ripple through an array of industries and hurt sales and earnings, possibly throughout the year.Tourism-related companies are feeling some of the most acute pain. China estimates 13 million individual passenger flights were canceled, and            Delta Air Lines      (ticker: DAL) and others have suspended flights to the mainland until March. Cruise operators are under siege as they approach a key period for bookings.            Wynn Resorts      (WYNN) is losing $2.6 million a day as Macau closed casinos. While markets have priced in a near-term drop in demand and brief supply-chain disruptions, the wider indirect fallout hasn’t been factored in, says Anh Lu, manager of the T. Rowe Price New Asia fund. “Everyone thinks everything is going to bounce if demand comes back, but previous incidents have shown that not every company will benefit the same way,” she says.The next couple of weeks will determine if the virus is contained. Many fund managers expect a sharp rebound in markets once the outbreak appears to be contained and factories restart, with            Deutsche Bank      estimating a 0.2% hit to full-year global economic growth—some of which will be recovered in 2021.While China President Xi Jinping has reportedly called for a loosening of restrictions, production is still halted and many workers stranded. Parts aren’t available—or companies are unable to provide the required face masks for workers due to a shortage. Even in the best-case scenario—operations gradually restart—the virus is going to deal China the biggest hit to growth since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Gavekal Research analysts Andrew Batson and Ernan Cui.As production resumes, fund managers will look for opportunities, though selectively. Companies with pricing power may be able to split the costs related to the virus—such as paying overtime or expediting orders to make up for lost time—with customers. But weaker companies could see margins deteriorate, and those burdened with a lot of leverage could struggle to make it even through the initial fallout. In a note to clients, UBS Global Wealth Management recommended a short-term playbook that favored high-dividend payers with strong cash flow while avoiding vulnerable companies in Asia. Here are some of the companies analysts and fund managers are monitoring for signs of weakness. Consumer stocks. Companies catering to Chinese consumers have been a bright spot in many global managers’ portfolio for years. But they are far from immune. Take liquor companies. Lunar New Year is a big time for alcohol consumption, and retailers, bars, and restaurants had stocked up in anticipation. But most large gatherings were canceled—and that lost demand is unlikely to be recovered. Inventory won’t need to be replenished for a long time. “Even when people resume going out, manufacturers might not get new orders for a while,” says Donny Kranson, co-manager of the Vontobel International Equity strategy. Shares of spirits maker            Diageo      (DEO) are down 3.7% so far this year, while            Budweiser Brewing APAC      (1876.Hong Kong), the Asia-Pacific subsidiary of the beer maker, is down 11%.The outbreak could also change attitudes toward eating out.            Meituan Dianping      (3690.Hong Kong), a darling among emerging market investors, has fallen 12% from a recent high last month. Only about 20% to 30% of restaurants have been opened for food delivery, and delivery volumes appear to be down 50% or more at the majority of those that are open, according to Bernstein analyst David Dai. Widely held luxury retailers and cosmetics companies like            LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton      (MC.France) and            Estée Lauder      (EL) won’t escape unscathed. Luxury stores on the most fashionable streets around the world are empty as Chinese tourism has plummeted. LVMH has estimated a not-too-terrible hit to sales, while            Estée Lauder      cut its profit outlook for its fiscal second half, though it expects a rebound once travel resumes. Over the long term, the outbreak is unlikely to wean Chinese shoppers from luxury goods, but for now, fund managers are looking to cheaper pockets of the market, like industrials. Industrials. The sector was well-positioned for a global economic recovery previrus, and economists still expect one, just delayed. In the near term, though, industrial companies risk weakened demand, as well as supply-chain interruptions, yet most have not adequately discounted the blow from the virus in 2020 outlooks, Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC, wrote in a recent note. Two exceptions:            Emerson Electric      (EMR), which estimated a roughly $50 million to $100 million hit to sales, or a 1.5% hit to second-quarter revenue estimates, if factories had reopened on Feb. 10—and a greater impact if it extended beyond that—and            Xylem      (XYL), which could see a three- or four-cent hit to first-quarter earnings per share.  Technology. Companies linked to China’s 5G buildout—which is reliant on government spending—could also be vulnerable, as the government may need to focus on other priorities. Plus, Wuhan is known as China’s Optical Valley, home to much of the optical-component supply chain crucial to the 600,000 to 650,000 5G base stations planned to be operational in China by the end of 2020, says Matthew Sigel, managing director at Hong Kong–based broker CLSA. If the Chinese government continues to enforce travel and commerce restrictions within Wuhan, “we could see Wall Street’s earnings estimates for some of the handset and 5G supply chain adjust lower and/or get pushed into 2021,” Sigel says.            Qualcomm      (QCOM), the world’s largest maker of mobile phone chips and modems, warned of “significant uncertainty” around its handset demand and supply chain. Components like printed circuit boards, optical fiber, and displays face the biggest risks to production, while LCD, memory, and Chinese auto technology may be more resilient, Sigel adds.Goldman Sachs      highlights semiconductor and technology hardware companies as the most exposed group within the sector, with 47% and 14% of revenue, respectively, coming from Greater China. These two areas also are starting with valuations that had baked in some good news pre-outbreak—signs the semiconductor industry was about to emerge out of a downturn with better earnings-growth expectations for            Apple      (AAPL). The outbreak has cast a shadow over those assumptions.Apple has closed all its stores and corporate offices in mainland China and is at risk of major disruptions, with nearly half of its manufacturing and supply sites located in China. While iPhone assembler            Foxconn Technology      (2354.Taiwan) was expected to resume production this past week, reports suggest some of its factories will remain closed, while others are operating with 10% of the workforce. For every week business activity doesn’t resume from Feb. 10, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar estimates a two-cent-a-share hit to earnings from lost iPhone or service sales.Apple has factored some of the hit into its outlook, mitigating some of the risk, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani. Other companies Daryanani highlighted as worth monitoring include            Amphenol      (APH), which has roughly 30% of sales tied to China;            HP Inc.      (HPQ), which has about 70% of its manufacturing workers in China; and            Dell Technologies      (DELL), which has more than half of its suppliers in China. Citi China internet analyst Alicia Yap summed up the wariness of those on the ground: “We would be patient and wait for better entry points and assess the downside risks versus valuation before getting too excited.” Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.comThe world’s second-largest economy has ground to a virtual halt as China grapples with the deadly coronavirus.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Warren Buffett has said for more than a year that he is looking for an “elephant sized” acquisition to add to            Berkshire Hathaway’s      portfolio, but he hasn’t found one. Now a team of analysts has drawn a blueprint for other investors to find stocks that Buffett would like—and maybe even want to purchase. Among them are            Target      (TGT), BlackRock (BLK),            General Dynamics      (GD) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). HOLT, a team within            Credit Suisse,      has come up with a framework that the analysts say finds Buffett-compatible stocks. HOLT uses a financial metric called “cash flow return on investment” (CFROI) that the analysts think gives a better picture of a firm’s underlying economics than earnings metrics. The analysts think that Buffett uses a similar framework.Buffett buys companies with strong management teams, high returns on equity, little or no debt, stable margins, and easy-to-understand business models, the analysts say. Among his previous acquisitions are railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe and industrial company Precision Castparts.Berkshire didn’t respond to a request for comment on the report.HOLT came up with 141 potential Berkshire acquisitions in several sectors, from consumer discretionary to industrials to tech. Some seem extremely unlikely—Bristol-Myers, for instance, is currently undergoing its own controversial acquisition of Celgene (CELG). And owning a defense company dependent on political support like General Dynamics might be out of character for Buffett. Other companies on the list seem more likely. Discount retailer            TJX      (TJX), for instance, has reported consistent returns and margins, putting it on another Barron’s list of stocks that could appeal to Buffett.Below are 12 of the largest companies on the list:TJX (TJX)Target (TGT)General Dynamics (GD)Northrop Grumman (NOC)Cognizant Tech (CTSH)Amphenol      (APH)Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Anthem (ANTM)BlackRock (BLK)Marsh & McLennan (MMC)Sherwin-Williams      (SHW)LyondellBasell Industries      (LYB) Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.comWarren Buffett has said for more than a year that he is looking for an “elephant sized” acquisition to add to Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio, but he hasn’t found one.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Investor sentiment on semiconductor stocks has soured recently, and a more pronounced slowdown could be on the way, warns            Morgan Stanley. Where we were: Chip stocks haven’t quite kept up with the broader tech sector in 2018, with the        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX) up 8.8% year to date, less than half the            Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s      (XLK) 19% gain.  Where we’re headed: Morgan Stanley lowered its estimates for the first time in three years, cutting its expectations not only for the fourth quarter, but also for 2019.Third-quarter earnings season is just around the corner, and semiconductor bulls might be in for a harsh surprise, warns Morgan Stanley’s Craig Hettenbach.He lowered his estimates ahead of what he believes will be an inventory correction for the semiconductor industry, spurred by a slowdown in key end markets like autos and industrials, as a number of companies in these areas have warned of lower sales, largely on the back of weakness in Europe and China. Inventory levels are on the rise, and even companies with broad-based customers may still feel the pinch as well, he writes.Hettenbach notes that investor sentiment on chip stocks has quickly turned negative: There’s some debate about how much risk is priced in, and while a lower bar could be easier for companies to clear, he warns that if estimates start to come down—as he expects—it will be hard for stocks to make headway. That said, he still thinks there are a few places to hide, specifically in companies with high-quality, defensive business models, and reiterated an Overweight rating on            Amphenol      (APH), and            Analog Devices      (ADI). By contrast, he urges investors to steer clear of companies with lower margins or weaker balance sheets, and reiterated Underweight ratings on            Cypress Semiconductor      (CY), On Semiconductor (ON), and Sensata Technologies Holdings (ST). SOXX is off 0.5% to $184.72, while XLK is 0.6% higher to $76.16. Make the Connection  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)has been falling on Intel’s (INTC) chip progress.Is it time to get more positive on            Broadcom      (AVGO)?Investor sentiment on semiconductor stocks has soured recently, and a more pronounced slowdown could be on the way, warns Morgan Stanley.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1," This article first appeared on SumZero, the world’s largest research community of buyside investment professionals. In some cases Barron’s edits the research for brevity; professional investors can access the full version of this thesis and tens of thousands of others at SumZero.com.  Disclaimer: The author’s fund had a position in this security at the time of posting and may trade in and out of this position without informing the SumZero community.   • Recent price: $92.94• Target price: $140• Timeframe: 2-5 years    Overview: How would you like to own a supplier to the Ford Model T, back when 99% of the world was running on horse and carriage?Well you can’t.But you can own something almost as good, and for the low price of ~14x off 2019 earnings ($6.50 excluding buybacks and M&A; predicated on conservative mid-teen EPS growth off conservative 2018 guidance). Earnings should continue to compound at mid-teens for a decade-plus, with a free call option on autonomous driving that has more than 5x the connector content needed (not in my numbers). PS: All the electric vehicle (EV) stuff in this write-up also applies to NXPI, which I also recommend owning.I’m recommending            TE Connectivity      (TEL) as a long. Recent earnings allow for a great entry point, as results both confirmed the secular core thesis of accelerating content growth and alerted the public to unfiltered negative noise such as non-core SubCom’s weakness, global/North America auto production, and trade/tariff fears. TE Connectivity is a global provider of connectors and sensor technologies, serving multiple end markets such as automotive, A&D, industrial equipment, medical, energy/subcom, and consumer (data networks and appliances). The company enjoys ~30% market share in connectors within its largest segment of autos, and despite fragmented markets, has top-three market share in most of the applications it plays in. The Company has almost evenly split geographical exposure with very high Asia/China exposure. Autos is a huge percentage of the company, though North America autos is only 15% of the auto biz which is 40% of revenues (important to note).  Company TEL gave a pretty detailed background of the company at their December 2017 Investor Day (included with the SumZero research report), so I won’t go too much into the company itself. One thing I will mention about the history is that TE Connectivity was part of the large conglomerate Tyco, which was split up after a large scandal regarding accounting irregularities and fraud.The history with the Tyco break-up and damage fallout has afforded current shareholders increased transparency, as TEL reports three segments and nine sub-segments, among other detailed metrics. Management is conservative, as the growing backlog includes orders with cash deposits only, resulting in almost 0% cancellations historically. There is a large portion of orders not included in the backlog that almost every other industrial company would include. Thesis Secular growth in hybrid and electric vehicles (EV), and future autonomous driving technology, should drive outsized alpha generation for many years. The key to this thesis is that rising content growth in autos (50% of revenues) and industrials (30% of revenues) will drive HSD to LDD growth, almost irrespective of what happens to the global end market (math shown in report, with pretty conservative hybrid/EV content assumptions).The below chart (included with report) is well known to existing shareholders, but I will focus on why the below is underestimating the near-term opportunity (i.e. 2019+) given recent changes in China and Europe. As a more near-term catalyst, I’m calling for an acceleration of synchronous growth given accelerating Chinese auto demand dynamics, larger Industrial incremental margins, and a return to growth within the Comms segment as SubCom turns.1.2mm of the ~94mm global cars produced annually are EVs, with Hybrid+EV penetration at ~5mm units. Even though TEL’s content per vehicle is 2x higher in EVs ($120 average), this number varies wildly by OEM. When TEL is allowed to participate early on in the design process for EV models, the results can be outsized. On example is the NIO, where the average $ content is $500+. Luckily, this model is ripping right now and gaining market share in China.“If you are wondering which Chinese company leads the premium electric vehicle pack, wonder no more. It’s NIO.”People also forget that there are multiples more buses in China than in Western countries. Buses are mandated (and have already) gone 100% electric in some tier-1 cities. The effect is enough to even affect oil demand, which is significant despite how small buses are as a percentage of transportation—which is itself a small percentage of total oil usage. This government mandate will also drive growth going forward, even if production flatlines or even declines.Perhaps the most important dynamic to note is that China has pent-up auto demand. It’s surprising that most investors don’t know this, but just ask any Chinese citizen who’s been waiting to buy a car. Which brings me to the most important point. There are currently multi-year waiting lists in tier-1 Chinese cities, which will continue to drive EV demand, with a hockey stick starting in 2019 as new models are launched and solve the biggest pain for Chinese drivers: range.Why the acceleration? A green license plate initiative on top of subsidies and tax cuts allows citizens to IMMEDIATELY hit the road with an EV car versus a traditional ICE vehicle. In some cities such as Beijing, even green license plates have a small waiting list, implying that ICE registrations have little hope of hitting the streets anytime soon unless you expect to get VERY lucky. This is a game changer and a major cause of EV demand, as some niche investors in 2016/2017 were going as far as buying dozens of cheap cars just to win the license plate lottery to resell to those on the waiting list.Regarding Industrials, which has been beaten up in the past few weeks given a misread of CAT’s earnings call: I would read Emerson (EMR) and            Rockwell Automation      (ROK) recent transcripts for some conviction on the fact that we are nowhere near the peak of the cycle. In fact, we’re only about one year past trough, and I see 2020+ as peak for Industrials. Even if you didn’t believe this, factory floor automation and warehouse automation is seeing immense build-out as reshoring becomes a real theme and not just a talking point. Years of under-investment has created a massive aging installed base in the U.S.Combined with higher “electrification” content needed in robotic arms and other connected automation solutions, TEL should see even higher than LT guidance of MSD growth in 2H18 and 2019. Cash repatriation, tax reform, 100% accelerated depreciation, and localization all drive capex investment. Orders growth in the double digits gives me a lot of conviction in the industrial segment (30% of revenues), with the largest margin upside to 18%-19% in 2020E versus low teens today given rearview cost cutting and SG&A providing high incremental margins.Regarding SubCom, this business is very lumpy and becomes a tailwind rather than a headwind. What gives me comfort in growth coming back (which is not needed for the thesis) is the strong orders growth and conservative backlog buildup. TEL has record Subcom backlog, $600m YTD orders (higher orders for all of 2017), and Google has stated that they commissioned three new cables this year (per Google’s Q1 18 transcript).2019 should be a great year given the backlog and the high incremental margin at SubCom, which can then lead to a sale of the non-core biz as a medium-term catalyst.As an FYI, all the big tech companies are significantly increasing their spending on Hyperscale infrastructure. Google’s Q1 18 capex increased by more than 180% YoY.So why does the opportunity exist? Anything touching autos has gotten smoked but in any given recent month it’s been a mix of tariff/trade war fears combined with fears of declining auto production and/or North American seasonally adjusted annual rate. SubCom’s recent project delays were the most recent “issue” that popped up, despite it currently under-earning and contributing zilch to FCF and being a headwind to margins.First, TEL has proven that global auto production has nothing to do with growth. The company saw 10% core growth in Transportation despite flat auto production in 2Q18. Furthermore, math works out to HSD CAGR from content growth alone, using mgmt. estimates, which is outdated/too conservative. To frame the risk, North America is such a small piece of the business that even a draconian 5% decline in U.S. SAAR would be a headwind of only $0.02 to EPS. Global and U.S. SAAR is the ultimate red herring in this story.Though one can play the same theme with semis with high auto exposure (i.e Infineon and NXP), we believe the best connector play is with TEL given outlandish (50%+ revenue exposure) to autos and EVs, versus lower for comps like            Amphenol,      Aptiv, and            Ametek.      Most of these comps trade at higher valuations and still need to make substantial investments in R&D and capex versus TEL’s portfolio, which is already at the level for full autonomous driving.Furthermore, TEL has #1 market share in all geographies with harsh-environment connectors, which are mission-critical yet low-cost components relative to the total vehicle cost. This is a huge moat, as harsh environment connectors need to be able to transfer huge volumes of data within the car ecosystem and ECU while making sure there is 0 latency/lag. Imagine an autonomous vehicle going 70mph on the highway; there can be no lag or reliability issues or the driver would die.TEL’s market position and increasing design wins/market share are overlooked by the market, at the same time that secular trends are about to kick in. Given low leverage of 1x+, catalysts include increased buybacks, bolt-on M&A deals, a sale on SubCom or the Comms segment, and continued beats+raises for FY 2018. Free cash flow will ramp heavily as TEL converts growth and winds down working capital in 2H18. Risks: Short-term slowdown in EV mixshift, which is easily trackable via European and Asian car registrations (particularly PHEV and EV registrations),Global SAAR production (particularly a slowdown in Asia), trade war with Europe/China or both; though TEL produces locally with relatively low-cost components versus something more substantial such as Boeing planes.

0,"Corning      (GLW: NYSE)  By Susquehanna Financial Group ($28.19, Aug. 22, 2017)The sum of the parts suggests Corning shares are undervalued by 15%-20%Additionally, our valuation exercise may prove conservative as we did not ascribe any value to Corning’s (ticker: GLW) Other revenue, which is on pace to reach $200 million in calendar 2017. All in all, the sum of the parts helps with incremental confidence the 12% pullback since the June-quarter print should be used as a buying opportunity.The key takeaways are: 1) peer group price/earnings multiples for each segment imply bottom-up market cap of $33 billion, or $33 a share, and 17 times P/E (calendar 2018); 2) valuation could range from $30 to $36 based on a plus/minus 10% band around peer P/E multiples, in other words, shares currently trade below the conservative end of our sum-of -the-parts framework; and 3) valuation is sensitive to Corning’s Display and Optical Communications segments, which contribute a majority of earnings and are outperforming peers on key operational metrics like revenue/earnings growth, margin expansion, and asset turnover.We remind investors our valuation work is sensitive to various assumptions (primarily the peer universe used) and is intended to serve as an alternate lens through which investors can value Corning shares.The five key operating segments are Display, Optical Communications, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences. Using the median P/E of each segment’s peer group suggests bottom-up market cap of $33 billion, or $33 a share versus the current share price of $28.20. Display and Optical account for the majority of Corning’s total earnings power, reflected by their combined 80% contribution to bottom-up market cap in our sum-of-the-parts valuation.We estimate Display could be valued at nearly $19 billion ($19 a share) based on the peer basket of Asahi Glass, Nippon Electric Glass and Kyocera, which currently trade at a median 18 times P/E. Display could even warrant a modest premium due to comparative outperformance on operational factors including: 1) cost of glass manufacturing is about 50% lower versus the nearest competitor; 2) asset turns improving low single digits versus peers flat; and 3) net profit margins expected to expand over 200 basis points by calendar 2018. Additionally, we note the highest-valued peer (Kyocera) is currently trading at 22 times, with asset turnover expected to decline over the next two years versus Corning Display asset turns improving 200 basis points, and Kyocera’s net profit margins of 8% are just one-quarter those of Corning Display. Valuing Display in line with Kyocera while holding other segments constant contributes incremental $4 billion to bottom-up market cap, or $4.30 a share.The Optical Communications segment could also drive incremental upside: The peers used for this segment include            CommScope      Holding (COMM), Prysmian of Italy,            Amphenol      (APH) and            TE Connectivity      (TEL). Their median P/E of 17 times implies segment-level valuation of $7 billion ($7 a share), although it is worth highlighting Corning Optical is expected to outperform the peer basket from calendar 2016-2018, reflected by: 1) revenue and earnings growth outpacing peers by 700 basis points and 1,000 basis points, respectively; 2) asset-turnover growth at a 15% point premium to peers; and 3) net profit margins expanding at nearly 2 times the rate of peers. This also holds true when comparing Corning to the highest-valued peer (Amphenol) which is valued at 25 times P/E. Applying a similar P/E to Corning Optical yields $3.6 billion incremental upside to bottom-up market cap, or $3.60 a share.Our sum-of-the-parts valuation does not ascribe any value to Corning’s Other revenue, which represents a number of new opportunities being pursued by the company that are not yet big enough to be classified in a particular segment. In this context, if any of these new opportunities were to materialize and achieve meaningful scale, it could represent an additional source of upside for Corning shares. It is worth highlighting that Other revenue grew more than 2 times in calendar 2016 and are on pace to reach $200 million in calendar 2017. -- Mehdi Hosseini  -- David Ryzhik  -- Bill Grinstead The companies mentioned in Hot Research are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.

0,"A New York City police officer uploads images of a suspect to a fleet of drones patrolling above Times Square. When the squadron fails to find the target using facial recognition technology, a new algorithm is sent and, based on an analysis of his stride pattern, he is found and apprehended.Simultaneously in Minnesota, a soy bean farmer receives a text telling her that, based on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels, and tomorrow’s forecast for between a quarter and a half an inch of rain, the irrigation and fertilization system will run for an hour less than planned. Meanwhile in Perth, Australia, a technician monitors a fleet of gigantic driverless dump trucks 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) to the north. The vehicles, each the size of a house, are filled by autonomous loaders with ore dug by robotic drills. The trucks haul the raw material to automatic trains that shuttle between the iron mine and a processing plant, 24 hours a day.This is now possible because of a convergence of sensor, data processing and network connectivity technologies alongside the growth, power and ubiquity of cloud-based computing. It’s a trend that is shaking the semiconductor industry out of a decade in the doldrums. While the advent of personal computers created a market for semiconductors in the hundreds of millions of units, and mobile phones in the billions, growth in those sectors has dwindled sharply and total volumes will seem like a blip in the era of smart, network-enabled devices armed with artificial intelligence that allows them to act and learn autonomously. The market for intelligent machines is expected to reach hundreds of billions of units within a decade, and could eventually measure in the trillions.These smart devices will be all-pervasive. While autonomous cars, connected home appliances and devices such as Alexa from            Amazon.com      (ticker: AMZN) and Nest and Google Home from          Alphabet      (GOOG) are driving awareness in the consumer arena, it’s in the industrial space that immediate financial and productivity gains and the fastest growth can be found. Rio Tinto      PLC (RIO) already operates autonomous dump trucks, drills, loaders and trains at its Australian mines. Amazon is doubling the number of robot pickers at its fulfilment centers, while companies such as            General Electric Co.      (GE) make jet engines that can determine by themselves when they need to be serviced based on the conditions they fly in. The impact will be felt in every industry and geography, and companies that aren’t already thinking about how a device or function can be made smart are probably too late. At the heart of these artificially intelligent machines is a trove of data that companies will increasingly need to collect, analyze and leverage to widen their competitive moat with new services and products.The convergence and increasing pervasiveness of inexpensive sensors, data processing and connectivity components gives industrial equipment makers such as General Electric, Siemens AG and Caterpillar Inc. the ability to evolve from being solely sellers of hardware to suppliers of software and services that provide recurring revenues at a higher margin, giving added value for them and their customers. And this isn’t some distant vision that’s years down the line. It’s happening now.Perhaps the biggest endorsement of the trend, which will drive advances in the technology sector over the next several years, was the $32 billion purchase of U.K.-based semiconductor maker ARM Holdings Plc by SoftBank Group Corp., completed in September. The Japanese Internet and telecommunications company then doubled down on its bet in October by committing as much as $25 billion over five years to a new technology investment fund, which Bloomberg reported this month is closing in on its $100 billion target. Among those said to be investing are the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund, which is reported to be injecting $45 billion, Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Co., Apple Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.Investors looking to benefit from this long-term trend should be positioned to allocate capital to well-managed companies with good assets and a competitive advantage in the semiconductor, connector, sensors, connectivity and Cloud arenas. SoftBank’s ARM is likely to be a key beneficiary from the development of smart industrial and consumer devices, along with semiconductor makers Microchip Technology Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Xilinx Inc. In the 12 months through May 16, Texas Instruments advanced 39 percent, SoftBank climbed 45 percent, Xilinx rose 50 percent and Microchip Technology surged 66 percent.Perhaps more tellingly, while the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index rose 63 percent in the same 12-month period, its 14 percent advance in 2017 lags the S&P 500 Technology Index by almost two percentage points, indicating that the trend is underappreciated.  Ford Races Toward an Exciting Future    Yahoo! Shares Still Look Undervalued    A Smart Strategy for Municipal Bond Investors  Producers of connectors, such as            Amphenol Corp.      (APH) and            TE Connectivity Ltd.      (TEL) , are also poised to benefit, with their stock rising 32 percent and 28 percent respectively over the 12 months through May 16.The growth in the amount of data collected, stored and analyzed should also favor Cloud computing giants Amazon, Alphabet’s Google,            Microsoft Corp.      and China’s          Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.,      while makers and operators of cellular masts -- such as            American Tower Corp.,      whose stock is up 24 percent in 12 months -- should see an uptick in traffic between mobile networks and smart devices on the edge of the Cloud.

0,"Semiconductor companies are starting to admit how big a hit their sales will take from the coronavirus. But some analysts are saying it is not as bad as their worst fears, at least so far. Chip stocks tumbled last week, along with equity markets, on more reports of the coronavirus spreading outside of China. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, declined by about 10% last week.On Sunday,            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI) lowered its March quarter sales guidance by $50 million to $150 million due to the outbreak. Last month, the company gave an adjusted sales guidance range of $2.195 billion to $2.255 for its first quarter.“What we have seen is lower than expected sell-through and order push outs in both our distribution channel and with direct customers,” Richard Clemmer, NXP Chief Executive Officer, said in the release. “We need to stress that these assumptions are based on less than perfect data, as the situation in China continues to be highly fluid.”NXP shares were up 3.8% to $118.00 at 12:22 p.m. Monday.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated his Outperform rating for NXP on March 2.“Overall, given the chaos caused by the virus it feels (at least to us) that it could have been worse,” he wrote.In similar fashion, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra on Monday upgraded his rating for            Micron Technology      (MU) to Neutral from Underperform, saying memory pricing hasn’t faltered much during this health crisis.The chip maker is a leader in the DRAM and NAND semiconductor markets. DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is used in desktop computers, mobile phones, and servers, while NAND is flash memory used in smartphones and solid-state hard drives.“DRAM/NAND flash pricing positive outlooks remain unchanged despite current demand weakness in China,” he wrote. “We expect memory pricing to remain very resilient throughout this year. Server demand remains strong.”Micron stock was up 3.1% to $54.19 on Monday.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh also recommended chip stocks            Analog Devices      (ADI), NXP and            Microchip      (MCHP) on Sunday, citing their lower exposure to consumer markets.

0,"Semiconductor stocks have soared over the past year in anticipation of a rebound for the sector. But Instinet analyst David Wong says the market may be misjudging the potential negative effects from the coronavirus outbreak on the chip industry. On Monday, equity markets fell after reports of further coronavirus infections outside of China, including in South Korea, Italy, and Iran.“While there has been a lot of attention on the supply chain disruptions associated with COVID-19, we think that many investors, and companies, may have underestimated the risk of the current issues impacting end market demand,” Wong wrote in a note to clients Sunday. “We remain cautious on the chip industry overall and selective in our chip and chip equipment stock picks.”The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor sector index, had risen more than 30% over the past year. On Monday, the ETF fell about 4%.The analyst noted how Analog Devices warned last week that the virus outbreak was affecting demand from its China-based industrial and automotive customers, while also slowing the rollout of 5G in China.Shares of chip makers            Micron Technology      (MU),            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) all declined more than 4% Monday.

1,"Analog Devices      shares were trading higher Wednesday on strong results for the company’s fiscal first quarter. For the quarter ended Feb. 1, the chip maker reported revenue of $1.3 billion, down 15% from a year earlier, but in line with both guidance and Wall Street estimates. Adjusted profit of $1.03 a share was ahead of the Street at 98 cents.The company also boosted its quarterly dividend to 62 cents a share, from 54 cents, lifting its yield to about 2%. For the second quarter, the company sees revenue of $1.35 billion, give or take $50 million, which is slightly below the consensus at $1.38 billion. The company said it lowered its outlook by about $70 million to reflect the potential impact from the coronavirus epidemic, although it said it was “difficult to estimate” the impact and “the situation remains dynamic.” Analog Devices sees adjusted profit for the quarter or $1.10 a share, plus or minus 8 cents, slightly below the Street at $1.13 a share.It repurchased $106 million of common stock in the quarter, and $492 million over the past 12 months.“Demand across our end markets has stabilized and is beginning to show signs of improvement as we enter our fiscal second quarter,” CEO Vincent Roche said in a statement. “We are building on this momentum by executing on our 2020 priorities—deepening our customer-centricity, deploying our capital efficiently, and capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth.”In an interview with Barron’s, Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche noted that about 50% of the company’s revenues come from industrial applications, like instrumentation, factory automation and aerospace and defense–and that industrial customers in 2019 were cautious buyers, focused on protecting working capital and reducing inventory in the wake of trade tensions with China. He thinks 2019 will go down as a year where there was “effectively an industrial recession.”But Roche says the company’s business stabilized in the first quarter, with improved demand from industrial, automotive and communications customers.Analog Devices supplies components to a wide range of 5G networking hardware subscribers, and Roche expects a multi-year boost from the rollout. But he cautions that the rollout will be lumpy, with a “bit of a pause” at the end of 2019. He says that “you have to look at the area under the curve over time” to measure the impact in the long run. For carriers, deployment is “a question of timing,” he says, “not if but when.”Roche thinks over time that 70% of the impact from the 5G rollout will come from business-to-business applications, for factory automation, telemedicine and security applications, among others. He sees growth as well in automotive safety applications, where Analog Devices plays a role in safety radar systems, among other things. But he’s no bull on near-term development of fully autonomous driving–he doesn’t see that becoming a reality for two decades or longer.As for the impact of coronavirus, Roche says the impact on the company’s business is entirely on the demand side, in particular from China-base industrial and automotive customers, with some slowing rolling of 5G in China. The company has no manufacturing operations in China.Analog Devices shares (ticker: ADI) were up 4% to $123.37 Wednesday afternoon. The        Nasdaq Composite Index      was up 0.9%.

The sustainable-investing firm also more than tripled its stake in cloud-communications platform          Twilio      (TWLO). Generation disclosed the trades in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The firm declined to comment on its stock trades. Generation’s U.S.-traded equity holdings, which totaled $15.6 billion at the end of 2019, represent only a portion of its $25.1 billion in assets under management.Lombard Odier Funds-Generation Global, the largest public fund managed by Gore’s firm, is based on a long-only global equity strategy that dates to November 2007. Since its inception, the fund, which had $1.89 billion in net assets as of Jan. 31, is trouncing its benchmark, the        MSCI World index.      More impressively, Generation’s fund has been beating an even tougher benchmark, the        S&P 500      index, which has topped the MSCI World for more than the past decade. The total return of the dollar-denominated version of the fund is beating the S&P 500 for all periods, apart from the latest one-year period. Generation slashed 85% of its Deere stock investment in the fourth quarter, selling 3.6 million shares of the maker of agricultural and construction equipment to end the year with 599,414 shares.Deere stock lagged behind the market last year, managing a 16.1% gain while the S&P 500 index surged 28.9%. This year through Tuesday’s close, Deere stock has slipped 4%, while the S&P 500 has gained 4.3%. The Barron’s Roundtable this year saw Deere stock emerge as a pick by Todd Ahlsten of Parnassus Investments. Deere “has one of the widest moats in terms of brand and network globally in the agriculture business,” Ahlsten told us.Analog Devices stock is another name slipping in 2020—shares are down 0.2%, although they had a strong 2019 with a gain of 38.5%.          Apple      (AAPL) warned on Monday that iPhone sales would be hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, dinging many chip makers, including Analog Devices.Generation sold 1.9 million Analog Devices shares in the fourth quarter, ending the year with 2.8 million shares.The investment manager also cut a fourth of its holdings in Microsoft stock in the last quarter of 2019, ending the period with 2.7 million shares. Microsoft stock has been having a good 2020 year to date, surging 18.1% on strong earnings and upbeat Wall Street commentary. The software giant’s shares are adding on to last year’s 55.3% gain.Twilio stock has gained 30.4% in the nascent new year, already topping last year’s mediocre 10% gain. Shares have risen recently on speculation that Twilio could be an acquisition target for Microsoft.Generation now has a larger exposure to Twilio stock. Barron’s noted that the investment manager initiated a position in Twilio in the third quarter; in the fourth quarter, it more than tripled the Twilio investment to 3.4 million shares.

1,"Multiple chip stocks are heading lower Tuesday in the wake of            Apple’s      announcement that its March-quarter revenue will fall short of previous guidance due to the impact of the spreading coronavirus crisis on both contract manufacturing and retail sales in China.Apple (ticker: AAPL) had previously forecast March-quarter revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion but now says it won’t reach that level, and Wall Street estimates are dropping to the $60 billion level or lower. Barclays      analyst Blayne Curtis published a list of component makers Tuesday morning by their revenue exposure to Apple—and most of the names on the list are heading lower. Note, though, that the losses are modest, a reflection of the relatively muted reaction to the announcement on Apple shares. Analysts are cutting their estimates on Apple’s March-quarter results but lifting projections for the June quarter. The widespread view is that the long-term impact on Apple’s business will be minimal.On the other hand, for companies who makes parts for mobile phones, exposure goes beyond Apple and includes both China-based phone makers like Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi and other Android handset makers who rely on Chinese contract manufacturers.Here’s the Barclays list of chip stocks ranked by estimated revenue exposure to Apple:Curtis also ranks chip companies by exposure to Huawei, the leading Chinese mobile-phone manufacturer, and by exposure to non-Huawei Android phone makers like            Samsung Electronics      (005930.Korea):Huawei exposure:Non-Huawei Android phone exposure:In early trading Tuesday, shares of Apple, Micron, Cirrus, Qorvo, Lumentum, and Skyworks were all off more than 2%.

0,"With 5G wireless mobile phones on the way, the time has come to buy shares of the key radio component vendors, according to BofA Global Research analyst Vivek Arya.Arya today did a “double upgrade” of both            Skyworks Solutions      (ticker: SWKS) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) to Buy from Underperform. He lifts his price target for Skyworks to $122 from $92, and for Qorvo to $130 from $90. He also repeats a Buy rating on            Broadcom      (AVGO), which he also expects to benefit from the growth in 5G handsets.“In our view, 5G could prove to be one of the more compelling and investible themes in semis, driven by the exponential growth in components required to upgrade ~1.4 billion 4G smartphones and several hundred million IoT Internet of Things devices,” Arya writes in a research note. “Radio Frequency chips will be a critical enabling technology to help monetize expensive spectrum and enhance battery life.” He says the first round of 5G stock investments focused on infrastructure plays, including            Marvell Technology      (MRVL),            Analog Devices      (ADI) and            Xilinx      (XLNX), but that the next phase could also favor RF chip stocks that have underperformed the PHLX Semiconductor Index since 2015.Arya notes that 5G technology should provide 10 times the bandwidth, requiring “highly complex/integrated RF components.” BofA sees $12.6 billion in RF sales this year, with growth accelerating to 14% annually over the next three years, from just 2% over the last three years. He says 5G phone adoption should grow from under 20 million this year to 200 million next year and 450 million in 2021.

0,"Analog Devices      stock traded higher Tuesday despite softer-than-expected profits and disappointing guidance for the current quarter. Management noted that the results came amid continuing “trade and macro uncertainty,” but said on a conference call with investors that a rebound was not far away.For its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Nov. 2, the company reported revenue of $1.44 billion, down 6% from a year earlier, and slightly below both the company’s guidance and the Wall Street consensus forecast of $1.45 billion. Non-GAAP profits were $1.19 a share, lower than the company had told investors to expect, and below the consensus view among Wall Street analysts that earnings would be $1.22 a share.Under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, profits were 74 cents a share, below the 86 cents Analog Devices (ticker: ADI) had told investors to expect.For the current quarter, Analog Devices is projecting revenue of $1.3 billion, give or take $50 million, with non-GAAP profits of $1 a share, give or take 7 cents. The company expects GAAP profits of 61 cents a share, plus or minus 7 cents.The previous consensus view on Wall Street was that revenue would be $1.43 billion and that non-GAAP earnings would be $1.18 a share.The company said it repurchased $172 million of its stock in the quarter, and $613 million over the last four quarters.“ADI delivered solid fourth quarter and full-year results amid continued trade and macro uncertainty,” Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche said in a statement. “Over the course of the year, we generated revenue of $6 billion and effectively managed costs, while continuing to prioritize strategic investments to drive innovation. Our strong margins and cash flow reflect the resiliency of our business model, which enabled us to return nearly $1.4 billion to shareholders, or over 120% of free cash flow after debt payments.”On the company’s earnings call, Roche said the company is “hopeful that market demand will improve as early as our second quarter,”After trading lower earlier in the day, Analog Devices rebounded, and finished the session up 1.7%, to $114.89.

0," 3:04 p.m. With one hour left in the day, a quick glance at the 10 worst stocks in the        S&P 500      show a consistent theme—investors are scared of semiconductor stocks. They’re not terribly fond of garbage, either.Of the 10 worst stocks in the S&P 500 at 3:04 p.m., seven of them are semiconductor stocks. That’s no surprise following            Texas Instruments      ’ (TXN) disappointing earnings, which appears to have rekindled worries that the chip market hadn’t bottomed yet. That explains the presence of            Analog Devices      (ADI),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM),            Applied Materials      (AMAT),            Western Digital      (WDC), and            Broadcom      (AVGO).That leaves three non-chip stocks to round out 10-worst performers, and each had their own reasons for dropping. There’s            Chipotle Mexican Grill       (CMG), which beat earnings but perhaps not by enough to warrant an 85%-plus gained in 2019.            Waste Management      (WM), meanwhile, beat earnings again—it’s missed just once in the last four years—whether it rises or falls is something of a coinflip. Finally,            Nike      (NKE) fell 2.9% after announcing its CEO succession plans.1. Texas Instruments -7.6% to $118.83  2. Chipotle Mexican Grill -4.6% to $792.98  3.

0,"Semiconductor and semiconductor-equipment makers have seen their stocks rally in 2019 as some analysts and investors called a bottom in the highly cyclical market. But just because industry demand isn’t falling anymore doesn’t mean a recovery is afoot. The back story. Semiconductor stocks had a brutal second half of 2018, falling harder than the broader market. Investors looking ahead to this year saw lofty growth expectations meet the reality of a global economic growth slowdown and the U.S.-China trade war’s disruption to intertwined cross-Pacific supply chains.Christmas Eve 2018 marked the bottom for the stocks, which have rocketed back this year as investors have been willing to give chip companies another chance. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker: SOXX)—which tracks an index of U.S. semiconductor companies—has returned 35% this year, including dividends, versus a 21% return for the        S&P 500.       What’s new. While a return to growth for overall chip demand may not be in the cards yet, KeyBanc Capital Markets semiconductor analyst Weston Twigg sees evidence that at least it isn’t deteriorating further. In other words, orders for a range of chip products may be done falling, as they have been for much of 2019.“Our quarterly Asia trip and supply chain findings revealed overall demand trends remain weak, but are not getting worse,” he wrote in a report on Tuesday. “Additionally, we were encouraged to find inventories beginning to normalize and expectations for normal seasonality in 4Q.”Inventories are not as backlogged as they have been in recent quarters, and while tariffs and other trade disruptions mean that uncertainty is still high, Twigg sees chip companies’ businesses returning to normal going forward. He particularly sees CPU, GPU, and memory companies as poised to see demand stabilize.  For semiconductor-equipment companies, the picture is a bit more mixed. Capital expenditures from memory makers are still weak, but Twigg called foundry investment “robust.” Looking ahead. Twigg recommends buying            Analog Devices      (ADI),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP), and            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI). He sees demand stabilizing and channel inventories becoming more favorable for these chip makers, and upgraded each of the stocks to Overweight on Tuesday.As the U.S.-China trade conflict carries on, Twigg expects Huawei Technologies and other Chinese customers to ramp up domestic production of components for smartphones and 5G infrastructure. That’s a negative for            Xilinx      (XLNX), which Twigg downgraded to Sector Weight on Tuesday.Twigg’s long-term outlook for the sector is more mixed.“With the escalation in the trade war and the accelerated initiatives by Huawei and other China OEMs to move toward China domestic and non-U.S. sources of supply, we are increasingly concerned about long-term implications for U.S. semiconductor companies,” he wrote. “Even post a potential trade war resolution, we do not anticipate a return to normalized U.S.-supply relationships.”The            iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      was trading down 0.7%, at $209.86, on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 was down 1%.

1,"Semiconductor-makers have faced a tough environment in 2019: high growth expectations have come up against the trade-war and economic-slowdown headwinds. But after these stocks plummeted late last year on those concerns, they have rebounded to outperform the market in year to date. Where the sector goes next is a subject of disagreement on Wall Street. The back story. Semiconductor and semiconductor-equipment makers belong to an inherently cyclical industry that sees periodic episodes of booming growth followed by inventory corrections—the current situation. After strong industrywide sales growth of 8% in 2018 excluding memory, the sector is on track for a 6% drop this year. The U.S.-China trade war has extended the current downturn. Most major semi players have been caught in the middle of the conflict, with supply chains and customers on both sides of the Pacific.The            iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (ticker: SOXX)—which tracks an index of U.S. semiconductor companies—tumbled a steep 18% in the second half of 2018 through Christmas Eve, after dividends, versus a 12% loss for the broader        S&P 500.But so far this year, investors have been willing to give semiconductor stocks another chance. Wall Street estimates for chip company earnings came down, managements reset their forward guidance, and the stocks have still bounced back. The semiconductor index has returned over 32% this year versus 17.5% for the S&P 500. What’s new. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur sees that outperformance continuing through the second half of 2019 as both supply and demand sides of the equation improve for semiconductor companies.“We remain confident in a second-half pickup in overall demand with near seasonal demand in PC computing, wireless/wired infrastructure (around 5G), aerospace/defense, smartphones (ex-Huawei), consumer/gaming, and a resumption in cloud/hyperscale spending trends,” Sur wrote in a report on Wednesday morning. The end of the year is a seasonally strong period for orders of chips used in PCs, smartphones, and gaming consoles, according to Sur. Ongoing 5G deployment in the U.S. and abroad will boost demand for wireless infrastructure products. He also expects data center capital expenditures to increase by as much as 30% over the first half of 2019, powered by big spending from the likes of             Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Facebook      (FB), and            Microsoft      (MSFT) on artificial intelligence and cloud chips.Others see a hazier near-term picture for semiconductor stocks. Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong noted in a report published Tuesday that total global semiconductor sales have declined at least 15% year over year in May, June, and July. Recently issued forward guidance from several chip companies implies continued sales declines in the fall, he added.“With the continuing U.S. restrictions on shipments to Huawei and rising tariffs on Chinese goods into the U.S., we think the chance of a meaningful recovery in chip end-market demand in 2019 is unlikely,” Wong wrote. “Our projections assume year-over-year declines in global chip sales in every month through the rest of this year.”For the full year 2019, Wong projects a 15% decline in semiconductor sales.Sur also acknowledges that the U.S.-China trade war, global economic data, and restrictions on doing business with Huawei could all be sources of volatility for semiconductor sector stocks. Looking ahead.            J.P. Morgan’s      Sur recommends buying diversified semiconductor companies exposed to growth in datacenter, automotive, and industrial products. He has Overweight ratings on            Broadcom      (AVGO),            Intel      (INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Micron Technology      (MU),            Marvell Technology Group      (MRVL),            Texas Instruments      (TXN), Inphi (IPHI), and            KLA      (KLAC).Nomura’s Wong, meanwhile, is largely neutral on the sector, including Nvidia, Micron, Texas Instruments,            Xilinx      (XLNX),            Applied Materials      (AMAT), and            Analog Devices      (ADI).

0,"Chip stocks are gyrating on trade-war uncertainty this month. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is telling investors that some chip stocks are worth buying after Tuesday’s announcement about delaying tariffs on some products. The semiconductor sector is exposed to global trade-conflict sentiment, as China and the U.S. represent key end markets for the industry, and most of its supply chain is in Asia.On Tuesday, technology stocks surged on the U.S. government’s decision to postpone tariffs on select product categories—including cellphones and laptop computers—imported from China. But the sector lost much of those gains on Wednesday on recession fears after the yield curve inverted.“Even if tension easing proves to be just symbolic (kicking can down the road)…it’s a near-term sentiment positive and shows US/China governments can be flexible,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya wrote on Tuesday.He noted that the tariffs postponements on some goods are strategically timed to avoid most of the holiday shopping season. Here are three Buy-rated chip stocks that Arya says may do well under the “Trade Thaw.”Nvidia      (NVDA)Arya has a $225 price target for Nvidia stock, which was trading around $149 per share on Wednesday. The chip maker has a “superior long-term growth profile in large, underpenetrated markets,” he wrote.Analog Devices      (ADI) Arya has a $130 price forecast for Analog Devices stock, which was trading around $110 per share on Wednesday. He said the chip maker has “best-in-class profitability.”KLA-Tencor      (KLAC)The analyst has $150 target for the chip equipment maker, whose stock was trading around $131 per share on Wednesday. The company, Arya says, has a “unique position as a key enabler of semiconductor manufacturing technology.” Write to Tae Kim at tae.kim@barrons.comChip stocks are gyrating on trade-war uncertainty this month.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0," Barron’s Picks are weekday stock ideas from our experienced stock pickers, based on the same rigorous analysis and reporting as the picks that appear each weekend in the magazine. We’ll publish a new one every Wednesday, and we’ll track their performance over time. Ever worry about getting stuck in a broken-down elevator? Imagine that instead of waiting for it to fail, the elevator’s manufacturer could collect real-time data on how key components are performing, and anticipate when repairs are needed. Rather than sending a repairman to figure out what’s wrong, pick up the replacement part, and return to the site to install it, the manufacturer could address the problem with barely a break in service. And by pooling that data over its entire installed base, the elevator maker could see which parts fail most often, enabling it to adjust its designs and engineer future elevators to eliminate that defect.Led by CEO Jim Heppelmann, Boston-based            PTC      (ticker: PTC) is working to make that vision a reality. Thanks to several years of planning and multiple partnerships, the company is well positioned to benefit from the industrial manufacturing process of the future: the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). If the company succeeds in shifting to a subscription business model from licensing for its core industrial design software products and can overcome some macroeconomic challenges, its stock could reward investors with double-digit gains in coming years.PTC got its start in computer-aided-design (CAD) software in the late 1980s, when it began to replace traditional methods of designing physical objects by pencil, graph paper, and slide rule. Four major CAD providers emerged, each with midteens market share today: PTC,            Autodesk      (ADSK),            Siemens      (SIEGY), and            Dassault Systèmes      (DASTY). PTC’s CAD solution, Creo, is used by 28,000 customers around the world from the automotive industry, to semiconductors, to aerospace, and more.Along with Siemens, PTC is a leader in the field of product lifecycle management (PLM) software, which allows companies to manage every aspect of the design, sourcing, and manufacture of their products. PTC is in the final innings of a five-year business model transition away from selling Creo and its PLM solution—called Windchill—via one-off perpetual licenses. As of this year, PTC is only offering subscription plans on those products. To date, it has been able to pull off the change because of how important the software is to its clients’ operations.“Their software is very sticky, it’s integral to the design process of all its customers,” says Evercore ISI technology analyst Kenneth Talanian. “Regardless of how it’s being purchased, whether it’s perpetual or subscription, the customer needs this product. In some ways they don’t have much of a choice but to accept the model change.” Clients pay lower upfront costs and receive new software upgrades without having to sign a new licensing deal. While the shift is beneficial in the long run for PTC, it presents some near-term pain. “The transition plays havoc with the financials optically,” says Michael Ware, senior research analyst at Praesidium Investment Management, a concentrated value-oriented investment manager that has held PTC shares since 2015. “As you go through it you’ll show temporary declines in margins and revenue, yet it’s a better model for the company long-term because it greatly increases the lifetime value of a customer.”PTC’s annual revenue has declined from its peak of $1.36 billion in fiscal (Sept.) 2014, the year before it embarked on its model transition. In its latest fiscal year, PTC brought in $1.25 billion in sales with 89% of software revenue in the form of subscriptions. In fiscal 2019, the company expects revenue to recover to $1.34 billion and for subscriptions to make up 94% of software sales.Because the proceeds from subscription sales are spread out over time while operating costs are unchanged, the model transition also takes a chunk out of margins. In fiscal 2014, PTC’s operating margin stood at 25%—last year it was 18%. According to Heppelmann, the company is past the trough in its financials and needs to execute on converting the rest of PTC’s customer base from perpetual license to subscription over the next few years. He expects operating margins to expand by 5 percentage points in fiscal 2019, to 23%, on their way to a targeted 37% in fiscal 2023, alongside 13% annual bookings growth.“What was a headwind will now become a tailwind,” Heppelmann tells Barron’s.Wall Street agrees: Analyst consensus is for $6.33 in earnings per share in fiscal 2023—versus $1.45 last year—on $2.4 billion in sales. A big part of that growth will come from PTC’s newest ventures in the industrial IoT space, where it is uniquely positioned to succeed, according to Evercore’s Talanian. “They essentially have a cash cow on one side of the business from the CAD and PLM software and they’re investing those resources to build out their software for the industrial Internet of Things,” he says.It is the logical next step for PTC because it can leverage its legacy installed base in CAD and PLM to expand to IoT, which it expects will become a $6.8 billion market by 2023, from $1.2 billion today.For industrial companies looking at employing PTC’s IoT platform, called ThingWorx, in their operations, the benefits include improving performance, productivity, and reducing costs. As in the example of an elevator maker, “the Holy Grail is predictive analytics for predictive maintenance, and that’s a software problem at the end of the day,” says Rob Oliver, senior research analyst at Baird. “Maintenance and unplanned downtime can be extremely costly for companies. Reduce that and the benefits go straight to the bottom line.”To expand its presence from manufacturers’ design operations to the factory floor, PTC announced a strategic partnership in June with            Rockwell Automation      (ROK), the leading maker of automated hardware used in applications from chemical plants to discrete manufacturing, with $6.7 billion in sales last year. The companies are joining forces on developing and selling smart-factory technologies to help customers collect, analyze, and act on information gathered in their factories. Other partnerships with            Microsoft      (MSFT) to bring ThingWorx to run on the Azure IoT cloud and            Ansys      (ANSS) on real-time design simulations provide additional credibility and reach for PTC.To underscore its commitment to the partnership, Rockwell invested $1 billion in PTC, for about a 9% stake, and gained a seat on PTC’s board. It is another bullish sign: Rockwell’s experienced management had a look last summer at PTC’s internal financials and made its investment at $94.50 a share. Now, three months since the launch of the joint PTC-Rockwell IoT product and with about a dozen contract wins under its belt—from            Ford Motor      (F) to Lavifood, a Vietnamese food company—PTC stock has dropped to $86.55 a share as of Wednesday morning.Some of that discount can be attributed to investor concerns about a slowing macro environment for PTC’s industrial clients, which may cut back on their spending. “At the end of the day, if their end markets roll over, their business is going to be hurt,” says Oliver. “The subscription model takes out the wild swings of a perpetual license model, but there’s still exposure to the cycle, no doubt about it.”Heppelmann acknowledges the cyclical nature of the traditional CAD and PLM businesses—software sales dropped 32% in the 2007-09 recession—but sees the IoT business continuing to grow through a downturn, because PTC’s solutions are about increasing productivity and saving on costs, an attractive proposition in both good times and bad.At their current level, PTC shares imply a valuation under a bearish scenario in which the company’s renewal rates decline by low-to-mid single digits, says Arthur Young, portfolio manager at Tensile Capital Management, a San Francisco-based investment manager and shareholder since 2015. PTC shares are down about 20% since their September high, and now trade for roughly 25 times fiscal 2020 free cash flow. Comparable companies trade for between 28 and 40 times forward free cash flow multiples, according to Oliver.He sees the shares rising 20% to $105, while Talanian has them going to $110, more than 25% higher.

1,"The dramatic plunge in stocks this month is a good buying opportunity, according to Goldman Sachs.The firm’s U.S. equity strategist David Kostin reiterated his year-end price target of 2,850 for the S&P 500, representing 7% upside from Friday’s close.“The recent sell-off has priced too sharp of a near-term growth slowdown. We expect continued economic and earnings growth will support a rebound in the S&P 500,” Kostin wrote on Friday. “We believe the market has moved past fair value and expect earnings growth will lift the S&P 500 toward our year-end target.”S&P 500 has declined about 4% last week and is down more than 8% this month.While the strategist said Goldman’s economists predict U.S. GDP growth will slow from 3.5% in the third quarter to 1.6% in fourth-quarter 2019, he believes the market’s drop went too far. Kostin expects better market performance as investors look forward to more positive economic releases and 7% earnings growth for the S&P 500 next year.The “sell-off appears overdone relative to fundamentals,” he wrote.For investors who want to take advantage of his bullish market call, he recommends stocks with strong balance sheets, companies with high profit margins and names in Goldman’s “high quality” stock basket –            Mastercard      (MA),            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH),            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Accenture      (ACN),            Ansys      (ANSS),            C.H.

1," Evercore ISI We attended            General Electric’s      Minds + Machines this week in San Francisco.The conference grew considerably from last year to 2,700-plus attendees as the interest of applying software to the industrial world increases in mindshare. There is no question that GE (ticker: GE) is approaching the task of building $15 billion in software revenue by 2020 with intense focus.The core of this approach is GE’s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution Predix which is designed to bridge the gap between operational technology (OT) (e.g. digital controllers for industrial equipment) and information technology (IT) (e.g. software applications).This ecosystem allows developers to leverage other software vendors (Splunk (SPLK) for example) in their applications, which we believe gives these vendors a significant opportunity to gain exposure to the industrial software opportunity. GE provided many examples of customers leveraging Predix to save millions of dollars through productivity gains further solidifying its relevance to the market.While PaaS is the smallest in terms of revenue and the least well understood of the three major clouds (i.e. infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)/PaaS/software-as-a-service (SaaS)), we continue to believe that PaaS is a very strategic market that will drive a significant amount of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) over the coming years as larger vendors battle each other for developer mindshare.In effort to reach its technology/revenue targets, GE continues to invest in software acquisitions (e.g. ServiceMax, Wurldtech, Wise,io, Bit Stew) as well as partnerships (e.g. GE’s expanded alliance with PTC (PTC)). As it relates to our coverage universe, we believe that GE’s focus on democratizing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a positive for many of the software vendors that are focused on delivering IoT-related solutions, including PTC, Splunk,            salesforce.com      (CRM),            Microsoft      (MSFT),            Oracle      (ORCL), Ansys (ANSS),            Autodesk      (ADSK), and Sap (            SAP),      among others. While we believe it is still in the early innings in terms of a more mainstream shift towards IoT, GE’s expertise in verticals such as health care, oil & gas, and aerospace adds substantial credibility to this secular trend and we continue to believe that software investors should keep a close eye on GE as it continues to build out its own software platform. -- Kirk Materne  -- Ken Talanian  -- Ted Lin  -- Fenn Hoffman  -- Tom Mao To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

0," Wedbush Beyond the information-technology universe, large industrial players have a variety of ambitious goals for their nascent Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled businesses, goals which we think will require significant acquisition activity in IoT and related software categories.Manufacturing automation and optimization, equipment monitoring, field service, and smart product development are emerging industrial uses of the IoT, driven by large industrial incumbents such as General Electric (ticker:            GE      ) and Siemens (          SIEGY      ) and new entrants such as PTC’s (            PTC      ) ThingWorx. GE has developed a software platform-as-a-service for the industrial Internet, marketed as Predix. Predix estimated revenue of $50 million in 2016 is still small, but GE has publicly stated a goal of growing its Predix software business to $4 billion by 2020. To complement its Predix platform, GE partnered with PTC to embed ThingWorx in its Brilliant Manufacturing suite of digital manufacturing products. We believe ThingWorx fills a critical gap for GE in IoT application enablement, particularly in rapid application development and deployment. GE has also partnered with Ansys (            ANSS      ) for IoT-enabled, real-time simulation of field hardware for predictive maintenance and product development.PTC is our covered company with the most intensive strategic focus on IoT. PTC is leveraging acquisitions of ThingWorx, Atego, and Axeda to connect smart products to field-service operations. PTC has also incorporated machine-learning acquisition ColdLight and Industrial connectivity platform Kepware into its offerings, while the acquisition of Vuforia’s augmented and virtual reality products provide new relevance to PTC’s Creo CAD products, especially in conjunction with IoT.Although IoT represents less than 10% of PTC revenue at present, we believe this rapidly growing business is increasing PTC’s relevance to its manufacturing customer base and to partners, with strong support from customer senior executives for IoT-enabled initiatives.Other covered companies Ansys, Autodesk (            ADSK),      Oracle (            ORCL),      Splunk (            SPLK),      and salesforce.com (            CRM      ) have some exposure to IoT. Ansys and Oracle have partnerships with GE. Autodesk has acquired IoT products, while Splunk can analyze the machine data produced by connected devices. We expect our covered companies to make tuck-in IoT acquisitions over the coming years. In addition, we wouldn’t be surprised to see more sizeable IoT acquisitions, including acquisitions of larger software vendors with some exposure to IoT and relevance to industrial-technology giants. -- Steve Koenig To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

1," Wedbush Our report provides an introduction to the three-dimensional printing market, including growth drivers and barriers to adoption, market size and growth, technology, applications and competition. 3-D printing enables manufacturers to create complex prototypes and functional parts. Already in use in the automotive and aerospace industries for rapid prototyping, 3-D printing is beginning to see adoption in a broad range of verticals, including food, dental, biotechnology, architecture, engineering, construction, consumer products, energy and defense. 3-D printer costs dropped precipitously five years ago, and we think a round of technology patents expiring this year should further reduce unit prices. The global 3-D printer market is accelerating; we expect it grow from about $600 million in 2013 to $13 billion by 2018, by which time annual printer unit volume is projected to be over two million.Although the market is still in the early stages of development, we believe 3-D printing will ultimately disrupt the design, prototyping and manufacturing processes across a broad range of industries. Early adopters are already finding 3-D printing advantageous for certain applications beyond prototyping. With 3-D printing, enterprises and consumers can customize goods without incurring molding and tooling costs, create high-performance products that conventional techniques cannot achieve, and reduce material waste significantly. 3-D printing could cause manufacturers (niche or mainstream) to pursue more strategies emphasizing custom products, and for supply chain participants (manufacturers, distributors, and retailers) to rethink their strategies and operations. For example, 3-D printing might see uptake for production of spare parts close to the point of service, and for the production of bulky items closer to the point of sale.The 3-D printing arena is crowded, with nine publicly traded printer vendors and many dozens more entrants. The largest printer vendors are 3D Systems (ticker:            DDD      ) and Stratasys (            SSYS      ). We expect the market to rationalize, led by existing vendors with broader portfolios and established companies entering the market, such as Hewlett-Packard (            HPQ      ) in partnership with Outperform-rated 3-D design software provider Autodesk (            ADSK      ).We see a market opportunity for more widespread adoption of low-cost, easy-to-use 3-D modeling software in conjunction with acceleration of the 3-D printing market. In our view, the adoption of 3-D scanners and printers can expand the market for design software beyond the roughly 10 million engineers and architects that currently use computer-aided design software. We think this opportunity may provide optionality for engineering and design software companies such as Autodesk and Ansys (            ANSS      ) (rated Outperform), which we already view as solid investment picks with relatively low risk. In addition, PTC (            PTC      ) (rated at Outperform) may benefit from enterprise adoption of 3-D printing through its partnership with major printer manufacturers.Autodesk is becoming a key player in driving mainstream adoption of 3-D printing. This year, Autodesk released its open-source Spark 3-D printing software and open-source reference design for 3-D printers accompanied by production hardware, Ember, expected to ship in early 2015. Also, we believe Autodesk partners with most major printer vendors -- with the exception of 3D Systems -- to provide design software for use with their printers. Autodesk’s stated motivation for providing open-source software, reference designs, and production hardware is to remove barriers to the adoption of 3-D printing (through the adoption of standards and greater interoperability of software and hardware), thereby benefiting sales of Autodesk design software. While we believe this motivation to be true, we think the move also represents a preemptory response to the possibility that 3-D printing could create a market opportunity for rival design software. -- Steve Koenig To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

1,"Ansys      (ANSS: Nasdaq)  By Wedbush ($74, March 27, 2014)We are upgrading Ansys to Outperform from Neutral and increasing our price target to $88 from $86 on slightly higher revenue and earnings-per-share estimates. Our upgrade stems from a more attractive entry point for            Ansys      (ticker: ANSS) shares, data points from Ansys recent investor day that make us more optimistic about the companys fiscal 2014 outlook, and indications of improvement in the software-demand environment in North America and Europe.Ansys is a well-positioned and disciplined company with good long-term growth prospects. Investors are used to paying up for Ansys, given its high operating margins, long track record of growth, and heavy mix of recurring revenue. Now, we believe a pullback in shares over the last several weeks and months provides a rare opportunity to own this competitively advantaged and highly profitable company at reasonable multiples. At present, shares are trading almost at parity, with a 5% premium to the median forward software price-to-earnings, well below their historical premium of 25% to 30%.Shares have shed 17% of their value since Ansys second-quarter 2013 earnings report in early August, as revenue growth has decelerated and the company has missed top-line expectations slightly due to weakness in Asia-Pacific and Japan. In fiscal 2011 and 2012, shares performed despite a general trend of revenue deceleration, which we attribute to: a) mean reversion following catch-up spending in the wake of the financial crisis; and b) general pressure on large software deals accompanying deteriorating macroeconomic demand from mid-fiscal 2012 to mid-fiscal 2013. However, as signs of macro improvement in the U.S. and Europe became visible in the second half of 2013, we think investors became more concerned with--and less tolerant of--deceleration.We think Ansys has the ingredients ready to accelerate revenues to the 10% year-over-year level by the second half of 2014. We think it is probable that several near-term catalysts will put Ansys back on a higher growth track this year. These catalysts include: fiscal 2013 investments in sales capacity and products; leadership changes in Asia-Pacific; our view that the software demand environment is improving in North America and Europe, based on our integrator checks and recent earnings results; easier year-over-year comparisons in fiscal 2014; and a moderation in currency headwinds.Longer term, we believe sustained increases in compute power will continue to drive greater use of simulation, which Ansys is able to monetize directly through its pricing model. -- Steve Koenig  -- Kevin Ikeda The companies mentioned in Hot Research are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.

0," Wedbush The quarter saw many disappointments.The first quarter in software started off with a big bust --            Oracles      (ticker: ORCL) February quarter miss -- and trailed off with a whimper as          Symantec      (SYMC) guided below consensus when it reported its March quarter. In between, the quarter saw a large number of disappointing preannouncements and earnings releases from the likes of            International Business Machines      (IBM),            Citrix Systems      (CTXS),            Compuware      (CPWR),          Red Hat      (RHT),          Tibco Software      (TIBX) and others.The misses appear to be symptoms of a global demand environment that remains weak, continuing a pattern we began seeing in third-quarter 2012. In the enterprise market, buyers have been deferring or downsizing large deals, as they seek to retain flexibility and minimize risk. As a result, deals are moving through pipelines more slowly and close rates have likely fallen.Although many vendors have reported that pipelines continue to grow as new opportunities are identified, back-end-loaded pipelines dont necessarily imply a second-half pickup, unless deal velocity improves.Beneath the macroeconomic waves are tidal currents that we believe are creating divergences between companies. Chief among these currents is the move from on-premise to software as a service (SaaS), which looks to be accelerating as cost-conscious buyers make difficult prioritization decisions.On average, SaaS names saw a positive 9% share-price change in the two days following their most recent earnings report. On the flip side, we think buyers are deferring or downsizing on-premise infrastructure-software decisions, as difficult prioritization decisions are causing buyers to delay infrastructure software investments where possible.On average, infrastructure names saw a negative 3% share-price change following their reports. Also, we think the results reflect a shift in the relative power of buyers and their control of spending dollars, towards the business buyer and away from the IT buyer, as even on-premise applications out-performed infrastructure.In fairness, we dont expect these results to be repeated every quarter. At some point, we expect improving global economic conditions to drive better demand conditions in the software industry, and relative improvement in perpetual license activity. And whether or not large deals return, year-over-year comparisons become easier in the second half. An important question facing investors is whether or not expectations have adjusted to reflect company-specific, category-specific, and industry-wide demand conditions.At the industry level, we are encouraged by seeing more companies ditch their prior expectations for acceleration in the second half, e.g., at our covered companies            Ansys      (ANSS) and          PTC      (PMTC). Also, macroeconomic indicators have been stable over the last couple of months, e.g. U.S. Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMI) are just above 50 and European PMIs are in the 46-47 range. Moreover, U.S. new orders (Institute for Supply Management (ISM)) moved up slightly from March (51.4) to April (52.3).At the category level, our outlook continues to be mixed, but we think investors should favor SaaS models and exercise care with positions in on-premise infrastructure, as expectations may not fully incorporate the ascendancy of the business buyer -- such as the line-of-business (LOB) manager or functional leaders like the chief-marketing officer (CMO) -- in IT-spending decisions.At the company level -- in our coverage space -- we would focus on two SaaS names (            Salesforce.com      (CRM) and            Workday      (WDAY)), two vertical-applications companies (            Autodesk      (ADSK) and PTC), and an infrastructure name with significant analytics exposure, albeit with some near-term challenges in its transaction-oriented infrastructure business (Tibco). These five companies are all Outperform-rated.Also, our analysis makes us more inclined towards business-driven themes, which makes us incrementally more positive on Neutral-rated            Pegasystems      (PEGA). Although Pegasystems decisions typically involve IT, business buyers often drive Pegasystems decisions. Moreover, the company could be poised to benefit from improvement in perpetual licensing activity as calendar 2013 progresses. -- Steve Koenig To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.comwith Soapbox Submission in the headline.

0," Benchmark Co. Though the potential impact of the upcoming presidential election on the software sector is far less than the risks facing other sectors (e.g., health care, energy), we believe investors should stack up relative risks of the various players, and should also pay attention to several focused vendors that could benefit from the election.While conventional wisdom suggests that the software industry is likely to benefit more from an Obama presidency, we believe the broader software sector and several vendors in our coverage universe could benefit more from a Romney presidency.We believe the main election issues that could have implications for the software industry in general and the vendors in our coverage universe in particular fall into six relatively well-clustered segments: taxes, regulation, H-1B visas, mergers and acquisitions, government information-technology spending and other industry perspectives.A Romney win would likely mean lower corporate tax rates, which is positive for the broader software sector. Gov. Romneys proposal to lower corporate tax rates to 25% from 35% would especially benefit            Ansys      (ticker: ANSS),          JDA Software Group      (JDAS),            LivePerson      (LPSN),            Manhattan Associates      (MANH),            Progress Software Group      (PRGS),            QAD      (QADA),            Pegasystems      (PEGA) and            Tyler Technologies      (TYL), which pay a fully taxed or close to fully taxed effective rates. Gov. Romneys support for a repatriation tax holiday for cash held abroad would benefit Ansys, JDA, Pegasystems, Progress and Qad. Additionally, the software sector would benefit if the research-and-development tax credit is extended, which is favored by both candidates.In general, the lighter regulatory environment favored by Gov. Romney would have little direct impact on the software sector, though its likely to impact many of the industries that software companies sell into, particularly energy, financial services and manufacturing. This would be positive for            Aspen Technology      (AZPN) and            GSE Systems      (GVP) in energy, Ansys, JDA, Manhattan Associates and QAD in manufacturing, and Pegasystems in financial services. Romneys proposal to amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act would likely benefit the smaller software vendors in our universe, particularly          Guidance Software      (GUID), GSE, LivePerson, QAD,          inContact      (SAAS) and          Saba Software      (SABA). Additionally, we believe an Obama administration would be more likely to seek some sort of Do-Not-Track legislation, which is currently stalled in both houses of Congress, a potential negative for LivePerson.While both candidates support enhanced immigration policies (particularly expanded STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) visas), we believe Gov. Romney is more inclined to expand the H-1B visa caps, particularly for foreign students with advanced degrees.We believe a Romney administration would be positive for merger-and-acquisition activity.While we believe government IT spending is likely to be reduced regardless of who wins the Presidential and Congressional races given the need to reduce overall government spending, a Romney win could be negative for Tyler since his plan to lower federal spending to 20% of GDP likely means lower federal transfers to state and local governments.We believe the election is likely to have a greater impact on the various industries that software companies sell into, providing an indirect impact to several software vendors. For instance, a Romney victory would be overwhelmingly positive to the energy and oil & gas industries, which is positive for Aspen and to a lesser extent Ansys and GSE. With respect to the retail industry, a Democratic victory could unfavorably impact consumer spending if the Bush tax cuts are repealed, which is negative for JDA and Manhattan Associates. -- Mark W.

0,"In the days before coronavirus, when markets were hitting new highs, technology stocks were the tip of the spear. Just a few weeks ago, there were four U.S. companies with market valuations above $1 trillion, all of them tech stocks. Those companies—            Microsoft       (ticker: MSFT),            Apple      (AAPL),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and Google parent            Alphabet      (GOOGL)—with their fortress-solid balance sheets, are poised to come out of the downturn just as strong as they went in. But for intrepid tech investors, there are less obvious opportunities to be found amid the current carnage and chaos.To help find the best ideas, Barron’s reached out to a few of our favorite tech-focused stockpickers. Some clear themes run through their recommendations: The work-from-home revolution underlines the power of cloud computing; we all still need to be entertained, even if we’re stuck at home; and we’re still going to need broadband, now more than ever.Here’s what the experts have to say: David Readerman Readerman is proprietor of Endurance Capital Partners, a San Francisco–based tech hedge fund. Readerman has zeroed in on cloud plays. “What’s certainly being reinforced right now,” he says, “is that cloud-based information-technology architecture is providing agility and resiliency for companies to operate dispersed workforces.”Readerman says the jury is out on whether there’s a lasting impact on how we work, but he adds that contingency planning now requires the ability to work remotely for extended periods. Among his cloud software picks are            DocuSign      (DOCU), a provider of digital-signature software, and            Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), the videoconferencing company that has been one of the year’s best stocks. “If there was ever doubt about the migration of the enterprise to cloud platforms, Covid-19 has proved its capabilities,” he says.Readerman concedes that Zoom’s valuation looks extreme—the stock trades at 34 times Wall Street’s sales estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2022—but he says there’s an opportunity for Zoom to monetize its surge in new users. He thinks that Zoom can expand beyond videoconferencing to offer a wider range of tools. “Zoom reminds me of AOL when it was everywhere, with ease of use and the freemium model,” he says.Readerman is bullish, too, on data center operators like            Equinix       (EQIX) and            Digital Realty Trust      (DLR). On the more speculative side, he likes their smaller rivals,            CyrusOne      (CONE) and            CoreSite Realty       (COR), which could be consolidation targets. He says that            Equinix      is seeing a surge in traffic to its servers, another sign of the growth of the cloud-computing trend. “Grocery stores are sold out of toilet paper, and we all need more broadband,” he says. Companies like            Equinix,      he adds, are “the critical on/off ramp for internet-based connectivity and commerce.” Rich Greenfield Greenfield, the co-founder of research boutique LightShed Partners, has covered entertainment and media companies for 25 years. His coverage universe was dealing with disruption—the technological kind—long before coronavirus, but the pandemic is creating a set of more serious challenges, with movie theaters and theme parks closed, sports shuttered, and ad budgets crunched. Greenfield notes that 12 of the top 50 TV advertisers are ailing auto makers; another 11 are quick-serve restaurant chains. The lack of sports content is particularly problematic on the advertising front. The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was canceled, and the National Basketball Association season, Major League Baseball, and the Olympics have all been delayed. There is no clarity on when the event calendar will pick up—and when people will be comfortable in public settings. “How long does it last?” Greenfield asks. “Does the stimulus ward off a recession or depression? It’s hard to tell. No one knows how to forecast this.”But people still crave entertainment, and that’s keeping Greenfield bullish on            Netflix      (NFLX). Unlike most content companies, Netflix sells no ads. And while movie and TV production is shut, Netflix has several months of new content ready to go. “They’re in a really strong position relative to their peers,” he says, pointing to            Walt Disney      (DIS), which has been battered on multiple fronts—its ESPN has no sports to show, its theme parks are closed, and it has no open theaters through which to distribute films. The weak ad market, meanwhile, is problematic for Disney’s broadcast and cable properties.Says Greenfield: “More people are using Netflix than ever before.” He notes that the number of subscribers is accelerating, which isn’t surprising given all of the home-bound people with more hours to fill and no sports to watch. He says Netflix will benefit from people switching to more expensive multiple-user plans and from reduced churn, or cancellations. In coming quarters, he says, Netflix will have “higher subscriptions, higher average revenue per user, and better free cash flow than people think.” Greenfield is also bullish on            Twitter      (TWTR), which this past week warned that revenue for its March quarter would be down year over year, as ad budgets fall. But, he notes, Twitter is seeing record usage. While profits and revenue will take a near-term hit, he points out that Twitter can withstand the crisis, with $6.6 billion in cash. And the company is poised to benefit from a crowded events calendar once the virus threat ebbs. “There aren’t enough weekends on the calendar for all the stuff coming down from September through summer 2021,” Greenfield says, with spring sporting events shifted to the fall, a packed film-release schedule, and the November election. “It’s absurd.” And he thinks it will all drive traffic—and ad dollars—to Twitter.  Paul Meeks Meeks wears multiple hats, as a portfolio manager for Independent Solutions Wealth Management, an asset management firm in Williamsville, N.Y., and a manager of The Wireless Fund, a small tech mutual fund. Meeks say that he has been using the recent rally to raise cash, while dabbling in marquee names and “banking proceeds for a better day.” Meeks says that he’s waiting until “earnings estimates are slashed to the bone” before making substantial new commitments. “I need to see them all confess all their sins, and to take down numbers dramatically.” In the meantime, Meeks has been nibbling on megacaps, specifically Amazon and            Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA), both of which he thinks will benefit from the expanded role that e-commerce will play in the post-coronavirus world. Eventually, he says, when earnings estimates reset, he wants to own his “dream team of semiconductor stocks,” including            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD),            Lam Research      (LRCX),            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing      (TSM),            Micron Technology      (MU), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT), where he expects to go from basically zero to a big overweight. Meanwhile, Meeks is bullish on            Virtu Financial      (VIRT), a New York–based tech-driven financial trading platform. Meeks sees the company as a play on volatility. He notes that Virtu trades for about 10 times earnings and pays a “fairly certain” dividend, currently yielding 4.3%. “When stocks go up endlessly again, and investors are complacent, they become an average company again,” he says. But, for now, Virtu will benefit as long as we continue to see “whipsaw moves in both directions.” Dan Niles Niles is founder and portfolio manager for the Satori Fund, a tech-focused hedge fund. On Feb. 17, just after Apple pulled its March quarter guidance, Niles tweeted that he had 50% of his portfolio short Apple, seven of the company’s suppliers, and        QQQ,      an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. It was a prescient call. Niles remains generally bearish on the market, but there are stocks he likes and owns, particularly around videogames. While Niles thinks the market has exaggerated the impact of a fifth-generation, or 5G, iPhone launch later this year, he sees opportunity in a less-watched product cycle: new videogame consoles from Microsoft and            Sony      (SNE), expected this fall. “They’re going to launch the first new hardware platforms since 2013, and everyone is stuck at home,” he says. “I like them all,” he says of the videogame stocks, including            Zynga      (ZNGA),            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO), and            Electronic Arts      (EA), along with China’s            NetEase      (NTES) and            Tencent Holdings      (700.Hong Kong).Other Niles bets are Amazon, a beneficiary from the shift to e-commerce, and work-at-home play            RingCentral      (RNG), a cloud-based communications provider. Meanwhile, he’s still ready to short Apple again as the stock rallies. For one thing, he says, “I don’t know who is going to feel rich enough to buy an iPhone.” And he wonders why anyone would pay 19 times current earnings for Apple, when other hardware plays like            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ) trade for just seven times.  Craig Moffett Moffett, founder of the research boutique MoffettNathanson, is the market’s most influential telecom and cable seer. He predicts deep issues for some of the largest companies he covers, notably            AT&T      (T) and            Comcast      (CMCSA), given their exposure to ad-supported content through their respective WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal segments. AT&T and Comcast are getting a boost from their broadband units, but Moffett sees better ways to play that trend.He’s bullish on            Charter Communications      (CHTR) and            Altice USA       (ATUS), both pure plays on the cable business and, therefore, free of ad-supported content worries. Charter is down 13% over the past month. “The fact that Charter has sold off as much as the broader market makes no sense at all,” Moffett says. “The cable companies are simply digital infrastructure providers. They are agnostic about how you can get your video content. And the broadband business is going to be just fine.” He says that Altice, while a little riskier than Charter, is even cheaper. Both companies are seeing demand for faster—and more expensive—broadband plans, with parents and children spending so many hours at home. Moffett thinks that Altice could rally 40% to 50%, while Charter could rise 30% to 40%. Moffett is also bullish on            T-Mobile US      (TMUS), which is about to be a strong No. 3 player in the U.S. wireless market after it closes a pending deal to buy            Sprint      (S). “They’ll be very well positioned, with line of sight to cost savings and margin expansion, and network advantages that should translate into market-share gains for years and years to come,” he says. And while Moffett still sees some risk to the deal’s completion, he thinks that T-Mobile is attractive with or without Sprint.  Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedYep, we’re all streaming more            Netflix.That is one of the primary takeaways from some new data from the research firm Comscore on the growing use of “over the top” video streaming services, as more people are homebound in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.In the period from March 1 to March 16, Comscore finds, total streaming hours on connected TVs were up 24% from a year ago; hours watched via streaming sticks from companies like            Roku      (ticker: ROKU) and            Amazon.com      (AMZN) were up 16% over the same span. What hasn’t changed much is what we’re all watching. It starts with            Netflix      (NFLX), which accounted for 37% of streaming hours in the same period, while YouTube’s share stood at 21%. Amazon Prime Video had 16% of the market, while Hulu has a 12% share. All other services accounted for 14% of streaming hours, a group that includes            Apple      (AAPL) TV Plus, Walt            Disney’s      Disney+, HBO, Showtime,            CBS      All-Access, cable-replacement services like YouTube TV and Sling TV, and a range of other providers. Earlier this week, Comscore disclosed research that showed a surge in viewing of live TV, in particular news. For the period from March 16-20, daytime viewership of seven cable news channels was up 24.5% from the prior week, 68.3% from the same week a month earlier, and 102.6% from a year ago. The month-to-month and year-over-year comparisons were dramatically higher in every given time of day—mornings, prime times, and overnight. Financial news viewership in the span was up 95% over the full day from a year ago, and 137% higher for daytime viewing. Daytime viewing of children’s programming is up 30.6% from a year ago.Meanwhile, a new survey from the Consumer Technology Association finds that 26% of American households started using online streaming services like Netflix for the first time in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, 48% report that they are now watching streaming services more often than before the crisis, and 49% say they are watching more live TV than previously. The CTA survey found that more than a third of U.S. households have purchased tech devices over the past week, led by smartphones (14% of those surveyed), laptops (12%), TVs (11%), wireless earbuds or headphones (11%), and wired earbuds and headphones (9%).AT&T      (T) issued new data Friday that show live viewing is up 15% in the post-virus period, with free on-demand viewing up 25% across both AT&T TV and DirecTV. Movie buying and renting has nearly doubled. Viewing of some family-friendly titles three times higher, AT&T said.With the market trading sharply lower, Netflix stock was up 0.1% to $363.05 in recent Friday trading. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedIn a record bear-to-bull turn, stocks ended on Thursday well off their lows on massive government aid, despite city shutdowns that have saved lives but slashed jobs. On Friday, stocks slid again after the U.S. took the lead in coronavirus cases. Investors are left wondering whether it’s time to buy, or too early, or too late. The least-productive thing I hear smart people doing most days is arguing politics. Right now, it feels like a second pandemic. I’m hearing stock-market and public-health opinions that seem to spring from a starting point of loving or loathing the president. I looked online at course listings for nearby medical colleges, and I didn’t find anything for partisan epidemiology. I’m assuming viruses, like stocks, aren’t especially impressed by party affiliation or hot takes on wedge issues. So here’s a plan that goes equally well with MAGA hats, Ridin’ With Biden pins, and Feel the Bern stickers.If you’re a long-term investor, it’s a good time to put money in stocks. Something simple like an        S&P 500 index      fund is fine. It isn’t important to time the bottom perfectly. You just have to buy at prices that are reasonable compared with the alternatives, and hold for a long time. The S&P 500 traded recently at 2630, which works out to 16 times last year’s earnings and 21 to 24 times some early estimates I’ve seen for this year’s depressed earnings. I don’t know if those are accurate, but so long as we expect earnings to return to prior levels over the next couple of years, prices are still reasonable, especially compared with a 10-year Treasury yield of 0.8%. Yields could remain low for years. If you’re a short-term trader, good luck. I’ve seen estimates that say the market could plunge by more than a third and ones that say it could march right back to all-time highs. I have my own estimates as to the anatomical sources from which those price targets have been pulled. If I’m right, some analysts are risking grievous personal injury by trying to produce two targets simultaneously: a near-term bottom and a year-end bounce. There’s good news for antsy investors: Diversification works. When the S&P 500 was down 30% for the year, a 60/40 mix of stocks and quality bonds had lost only about 20%. It had lost 10% versus its level in the same period a year earlier. That wasn’t a fun ride, but it wasn’t disastrous for investors with a decade or more to ride out the downturn. Everything now depends on the course of the virus. I’m hopeful it will abate with warm weather; that shops and offices can open by late spring or early summer; that pills on hand for things like malaria and arthritis will prove effective remedies for Covid-19; that any fall recurrence will be much less severe; and that shoppers by then will feel confident enough to spend. But I’m prepared for disappointments on any of these things. You should be, too, no matter which lever you plan to pull come Election Day. If you want to buy stocks, diversify. If you want to buy stocks patriotically, diversify while singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” I like to start low so I can really let loose on “land of the free.” I’m not much more impressed with Buy ratings than with index price targets. But ratings changes—when an analyst goes from Hold to Buy, for example—are more interesting. Academic evidence for their predictive power is iffy; a 2010 study found that investing based on ratings changes produced handsome returns, but a more recent working paper found that those returns have diminished. Upgrades aren’t all the same, however. I use them as an opportunity to examine the strength of each case.An investor trying to do that in this volatile market had better be fast. There was a flurry of upgrades on Monday, March 23—hosannah! But after a few days of rapturous market gains, some calls were left looking outdated.            Goldman Sachs      on Monday moved            Boeing      (ticker: BA) to Buy from Neutral and said it was headed 82% higher, to $173. Bold call? Not bold enough. By Thursday, the stock closed at $180, making it the top S&P 500 gainer over those days. Morgan Stanley      says            PepsiCo      (PEP) is benefiting from a surge in snacking at home. The report didn’t mention me by name, but when the firm raised its rating to Overweight, I took it personally. Pepsi shares rose 15% by Thursday’s close. They trade at 20 times earnings with a 3.3% dividend yield. Still attractive?            Credit Suisse      thinks so—it upgraded Pepsi to Outperform on Friday. Airlines are key beneficiaries of a coronavirus bailout package, and two firms,            Bank of America      and Raymond James, upgraded            Southwest Airlines       shares (LUV). They rose 29% through Thursday. The shares trade at 10 times last year’s earnings. This year’s earnings are a guess. Baird upgraded            Netflix      (NFLX) to Outperform, pointing out that it continues to take share from traditional television during our national work-from-home-athon. It climbed only 9%. Why? It has been a top gainer year to date. The worst-performing stocks during the week through Thursday included germ-fighting and stay-at-home names that were up nicely this year, like            Clorox      (CLX),            Campbell Soup      (CPB), and            Kroger      (KR). Investors seem to view the shutdown as less of a long-term investment trend. That’s as bright a sign as any.  I spoke this past week with            CVS Health       (CVS) chief Larry Merlo. I’ve never appreciated grocery workers more than now, and the same goes for drugstore staff, so I was glad to see CVS roll out some front-line bonuses and extra benefits. Part of that conversation will be in episode two of my new podcast, called Barron’s Streetwise, after this column. Episode one, available now, is about the search for a Covid-19 treatment.

All Rights ReservedLow-volatility funds are great when market volatility is sending stocks plummeting. But when volatility sends stocks sharply, and unexpectedly, higher—as happened this past week—these funds can seem alarmingly sluggish. But investors should expect more volatility in the coming weeks, months, and years—and low-vol mutual and exchange-traded funds can provide some much-needed cushion for the ride. Consider how some of these funds held up in the stomach-churning month after the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      hit its all-time high on Feb. 12: The largest such strategy, the $29.3 billion        iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA      ETF (ticker: USMV), was down 9% year to date through March 11, performing better than 96% of other large-blend funds, according to            Morningstar,      and nearly six percentage points better than the Russell 1000. The fund is up an average of 6% a year for the past five years, putting it in the top 4% of its category.  Market Data Center:  Funds & ETFs A 9% loss doesn’t sound so bad when the market is crashing. “A lot of our clients are looking to de-risk within their equity allocation rather than rely on bonds,” says Michael Hunstad, head of quantitative strategies at Northern Trust Asset Management. “Low-volatility funds make that possible because they implement an asymmetric beta strategy.” In other words, they will rise and fall with the market, but not as dramatically. Here’s what that looks like: In 2018, when the Russell 1000 fell 4.8%, the lowest-volatility stocks declined 1.6%, according to a recent analysis by Hunstad’s team. When markets recovered in 2019 and the index returned 31.4%, low-volatility stocks weren’t far behind, ending the year up 29.8%. It’s the investing equivalent of having some of your cake and eating most of it. Low-volatility stocks “certainly have a place in a portfolio,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of The Leuthold Group.Historically, there has been a strong correlation between the performance of low-volatility stocks and bond yields. “Low-risk stocks tend to be high-dividend-paying stocks,” says Joseph Mezrich, head of quantitative strategy at Nomura Instinet. But there are caveats. For starters, these funds may perform almost as well in a gradually rising market, but when stocks shot up last week, they trailed significantly. Also, the term “low volatility” isn’t absolute—it is an intention, not a promise. Fund research firms Morningstar and Refinitiv Lipper don’t even have a low-volatility category; instead, low-vol funds are categorized by size (such as small- or large-company), region, or style (growth, value, blend). All this makes choosing and comparing low-volatility funds tricky. *1 Month period through march 11. **1 Month period through March 25Source: MorningstarA low-volatility fund should not fall as much as its category peers (other large- or small-company funds, for instance), a metric known as downside capture. These funds will typically have a lower upside capture, meaning they don’t rise as much as their peers. Also look at the fund’s stock-picking criteria: Some own the stocks that demonstrated the least volatility in the prior year, which can lead to a bias toward defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples. One of the largest ETFs, the $8.7 billion        Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility      (SPLV), weights its holdings based on the 100 least-volatile stocks over the previous 12 months. Recently, these sectors have benefited (relatively speaking) from the stampede to safety. Hunstad prefers a different approach. “The last thing you want to do is buy into a low-volatility strategy that is overweight sectors that are very expensive relative to the benchmark or their own history,” he says.His team uses a quantitative process that favors high-quality names and controls for unintended active exposures, such as sector, industry, and individual stock. Recent top holdings in the        FlexShares US Quality Low Vol      ETF (QLV), launched in July, included            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ),            Verizon Communications      (VZ),            Apple      (AAPL), and            Mastercard      (MA). While the ETF is down 22% in 2020, the strategy behind it has returned an average of 8% a year from its 2014 inception through March 25, versus 6.2% for the Russell 1000.The            iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF      also takes a more nuanced approach, such as targeting the least-volatile stocks within their respective sectors and looking at exposures of the overall portfolio. The fund was down nearly 1% for the week through March 25, while its peer group and the benchmark were up—though it is still ahead of 86% of its peers this year. Many active funds in this sphere blend quantitative and fundamental research. The        BMO Low Volatility Equity      fund (BLVAX) ranks within the top decile of its Morningstar large-value peer group for every major trailing time period through five years. While the fund has fared better than the market and peers in the past month, it hasn’t forgone upside. In 2019, it returned 24%, lagging behind its category average by less than a percentage point. Recent top holdings include            Costco Wholesale      (COST) and gold miner            Newmont      (NEM). MFS Low Volatility Equity      (MLVAX), which launched in 2013, avoids the most-volatile stocks. The managers combine quantitative and fundamental research to see which companies are likely to weather current swings.Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity      fund (FULVX) launched last November, but success in similar strategies suggests that it can deliver. The fund combines fundamental stock selection with quantitative portfolio-construction techniques, with the goal of reducing absolute portfolio risk to outperform over a full market cycle. While it is down 23% in 2020, it still has an edge on its large-blend peers.

All Rights ReservedBoeing      reclaimed its crown as the largest American industrial firm Thursday, cracking the $100 billion market-capitalization threshold again.To say the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has reshaped the industrial marketplace would be an understatement. The changes in market capitalization of industrial firms over the past six or seven weeks tells an interesting story about how the world has changed. Just $100 billion might not seem all that impressive in 2020.            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT) and            Apple      (AAPL), for instance, are each worth more than $1 trillion. But $100 billion is to industrial companies what $1 trillion is to tech firms. Some of the oldest, most famous American companies aren’t valued like today’s tech giants.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      hits its 52-week high on Feb. 12. Back then, there were seven U.S. industrial companies with market capitalizations north of $100 billion—including            Tesla      (TSLA)—and the top 10 were collectively valued at more than $1.2 trillion.Five of the top 10 industrials have aerospace and defense in their corporate DNA: Boeing (BA),            General Electric      (GE),            Lockheed Martin      (LMT),            United Technologies      (UTX), and            Honeywell      (HON). Prior to the pandemic, aerospace and defense was regarded as the best industrial end market. Things are different now: Defense has held up better, but investors’ confidence in consumer air travel has been shaken. Air traffic, historically, doubles every 15 years. Investors are less certain that will happen again now that about 7,000 planes are grounded because no one is traveling. At the market’s nadir, on Monday, no industrial company was worth $100 billion and the group’s value had fallen 43% to less than $700 billion. Boeing ranked eight out of 10 and Tesla was in the top spot. After the electric-vehicle pioneer, railroads and logistics—represented by            United Parcel Service      (UPS)—were the largest firms. Tesla, of course, is a car company. Auto makers are officially consumer discretionary firms. But they are some of the largest manufacturers in the world. Tesla also makes batteries and solar panels and owns a global EV charging network. Things change quickly in this market. As of Thursday’s closing price, there is only one $100 billion industrial: Boeing. The value of the group is up 28% to about $800 billion. The value of the aerospace and defense components are up more than 40%. The $2 trillion government stimulus package, passed by the Senate recently, has billions for air travel. That has helped calm investors. It has also, very likely, taken the worst outcomes for the aviation sector off the table.Despite the bounce, the industrials with the most commercial aerospace exposure remain down about 33% from the February market peak. The other largest industrials are off about 19%. Things continue to change quickly. The        S&P 500      is off 3.5% and Boeing is down more than 11% in early Friday trading, giving back some of a five-day gain that sent shares up about 90%. Investors can expect more volatility from industrial stocks in coming weeks.

0,"Companies with higher environmental, social, and governance factors have outperformed the broad market since its February peak, contradicting views that the trend is just a bull-market phenomenon.In a new report, companies with better ESG risk profiles beat those with lower ones since the        S&P 500 peaked on Feb. 19, according to a report by Sara Mahaffy, U.S. equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Meanwhile, two-thirds of actively managed sustainable equity funds were beating their benchmark in March, Mahaffy pointed out. They were helped by the fact that they were underweight in energy and financials; held higher-quality stocks as measured by higher returns on equity, invested capital, and assets; and they tend to own popular S&P 500 names that have held up better, such as            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT),            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Visa      (V), and            Apple      (AAPL). Flows into ESG exchange-traded funds stayed positive into March, Mahaffy wrote.“This is not a bubble or a trend,” says Erika Karp, CEO of Cornerstone Capital, an investment advisor with a sustainable focus. “ESG analysis is way more important than we could have imagined.”RBC’s findings were echoed in a report by BofA Global Research strategists led by Savita Subramanian. The report showed that since the Feb. 19 peak, stocks with ESG scores in the top quintile outperformed those that ranked poorly by five to 10 percentage points in the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, stocks with lower ESG scores were seeing bigger cuts to earnings forecasts. In Asia, BofA wrote, the phenomenon of ESG outperformance didn’t hold, partly because China and India outperformed Australia and Japan. That was partly because China, in particular, “has had better Covid-19 timing and containment,” the team pointed out.“ESG is a bear market necessity, not a bull market luxury,” BofA wrote, disputing recent critiques suggesting that in times of stress, investors and companies would allocate all resources to staying afloat, and that an ESG focus was a luxury.Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, says that it was possible that the push for companies to make ESG disclosures could slow down, particularly disclosure of “nitpicky” ESG factors. “But big issues like climate change will continue to resonate with investors,” and company disclosures about environmental practices will continue to proliferate, he says.Bud Sturmak, co-chief investment officer of Perigon Wealth Management, notes that sustainable investing is being “mainstreamed,” with ratings firms, central banks, insurers, and corporate lenders incorporating ESG risks into their assessments. “There is now a clear and direct line from a company’s ESG performance to cost of capital, profitability, and share-price volatility,” he says.Whatever the critiques, “the underpinnings of sustainable investing remain alive and well—despite the collapse in oil prices and the fact that many governments’ green growth agendas could be pushed back in time,” Sustainable Market Strategies wrote. “In fact, current market pricing of several ESG-relevant investment themes suggests that investors are still confident that the future will be a more sustainable one.”  Write to Leslie P.

All Rights ReservedAdd servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedIn the world before coronavirus,            Apple’s      shares were largely driven by the anticipated fall arrival of the first 5G iPhones. While Apple hasn’t said boo about a date for the expected upgrade to its flagship line, the company historically upgrades phones in the fall, 5G is certainly coming, and a launch before the 2020 holiday shopping season seemed like a sure thing.But with global supply chains under pressure, Apple stores closed everywhere outside of China, and billions of people stuck inside their homes, there are growing doubts about when the next-generation iPhones might emerge from Cupertino. (Or more accurately, from Hon Hai’s factories in China.)Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, one of the Street’s biggest Apple cheerleaders, recently cut his price target on the stock to $335 from $400. Thursday morning, the stock was up 1.9%, to $249.95.Ives maintained a Buy rating on Apple, and continues to believe that we’re going to see a 5G iPhone “supercycle” once the new phones show up. But he doubts a fall launch is still in the cards.Ives wrote in a research note that Apple “finds itself staring at a major quagmire” as it decides whether to launch the new phones this fall. He now thinks a September or October launch looks “extremely unlikely,” putting the probability at 10%-15%. The issues: lingering supply-chain troubles across Asia, and consumers more concerned about staying alive, keeping their jobs, and finding groceries and hand sanitizer than buying a new iPhone. Ives said mass production of the iPhone 12, or whatever Apple will call it, wouldn’t start until May. But he adds that the associated planning, design, and logistics issues will make a fall launch a challenge, in particular given that Apple’s engineers are locked down in their Silicon Valley houses, with little prospect of flying to China to coordinate with Hon Hai and component suppliers on manufacturing the new phones.“Having one of its most important iPhone launches in its history into a consumer environment still recovering from the impact of this unprecedented Covid-19 dark storm would be a risky decision that likely gets shelved until the holiday season in our opinion,” Ives writes. “Apple has one shot at its first 5G launch and tepid success out of the gates due to a lukewarm consumer appetite would be a disaster scenario.” He thinks investors are already starting to factor in a December launch for the 5G iPhone.But Ives is still bullish. He contends that the stock is still “extremely compelling at current levels” for risk-tolerant investors, given the potential for a delayed 5G supercycle over the next 12 to 18 months. “In a nutshell, Apple’s stock now is pricing in depressed iPhone units, a 5G launch getting delayed, and supply chain not normalizing till the May/June time frame,” he wrote. “We believe iPhone 12 now likely launches around the holiday time frame in a more normalized consumer environment with springboard-like demand momentum heading into fiscal 2021.” Meanwhile, BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan on Thursday repeated his Buy rating on Apple shares, while cutting his target on the stock to $300, from $320. Mohan slashed his estimates for the March and June quarter, but expects most of the company’s demand issues to be transitory. His financial models still assume the 5G iPhone will arrive in the September quarter. Write to Eric J.

1,"It’s time to buy            Apple      shares. At least, Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong thinks so. Late Tuesday, he raised his rating on Apple (ticker: AAPL) to Buy from Hold, while trimming his price target on the stock to $270, from $295. Ong thinks the stock has become too cheap to ignore in the recent market meltdown.Ong writes that while he’s always admired the company, he’s long considered the stock simply too expensive. But with the recent downturn, Ong has become more comfortable with the stock price.Ong concedes that there are risks, including Apple’s ongoing retail store closures, supply chain issues and weaker demand as a result from the global coronavirus pandemic—but he considers all of those risks to be short-term in nature. “We concede that our updated model may not be adequately de-risked for the near-term downside given the unknowns,” he writes. But he is bullish nonetheless. Ong thinks the coming 5G iPhone cycle will drive strong unit growth, and he expects further strong growth for AirPods. He sees the services segment benefiting from the 1.5 billion+ active installed base of Apple devices. And he thinks gross margins will have an upward bias as a shift to services continues. “Overall, while we worry about the near-term downside from retail store closures and smaller spending purses from unemployment/economic dislocation, we believe these long-term drivers remain largely intact,” he writes.Amid a huge market rally on Tuesday, Apple shares rallied 10%, to $246.88. In premarket trading Wednesday, the stock was up 0.8%, while the        S&P 500       was down 0.9% and the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was up 0.1%. Write to Eric J.

0,"With health workers nationwide running low on masks and other protective gear, a growing list of technology companies are locating their own supplies and donating them to those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, a            SoftBank Group      (SFTBY) executive announced on Twitter that the company is donating 1.4 million N95 respirator masks to the State of New York. A spokesperson for SoftBank said the company obtained the masks specifically to donate them to the state. SoftBank’s announcement—and those from other tech firms—stands out given the shortage in medical supplies across the country. On March 17, the attorneys general of Massachusetts, New York, and California wrote a letter to President Trump asking the government for help in obtaining masks, eye protection, gowns, and gloves as the pandemic spreads. “We are in the early days of this public health crisis and are already facing a significant shortage of necessary protective medical gear,” the AGs said in the letter. “Some hospital officials in Massachusetts are instructing workers to begin reusing N95 respirator masks to conserve rapidly dwindling supplies.”Apple      (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook tweeted on Saturday that the company is donating “millions of masks” for health professionals in the U.S. and Europe.            Facebook      (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Saturday said his company is donating an emergency reserve of 720,000 masks that Facebook had accumulated in response to the recent California wildfires. Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff tweeted on Saturday that the company has donated 9,000 masks to the hospital at the University of California San Francisco—and that it plans to deliver another five million masks this week, along with other protective gear to Bay Area hospitals. Other companies pitching in include            PG&E      (PCG) with 950,000 masks, Elon Musk’s SpaceX and            Tesla      (TSLA) with 250,000 masks, Flexport with 60,000 masks, and            IBM      (IBM) with 15,000 masks.Technology companies often have deep logistical networks, particularly in China, where many medical masks are produced. A search of Alibaba.com—the English language website of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group—includes many listings for N95 masks, some offering quantities in the tens of thousands. The tech donations represent a small share of the needed supplies. The letter from state attorneys general cited a need for 12 billion masks “to protect those on the front lines over the course of this epidemic.”  Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedApple      shares have retaken the $1 trillion market-value level, as its stock rallies along with the broad market. On Monday, the company’s market value closed the day below $1 trillion level for the first time since September.But with shares up 6.5% Tuesday, to $238.98, Apple’s market value is now at $1.05 trillion. The        S&P 500      was up 6.4% on Tuesday afternoon. Apple is the second-largest U.S. company by market value, trailing only            Microsoft      (MSFT) at $1.13 trillion. There’s little question that Apple (ticker: AAPL) is feeling significant impact from the coronavirus pandemic. More than a month ago, Apple warned that it wouldn’t reach its previous March quarter revenue guidance due to both supply chain and demand issues in China. The picture has since shifted. There are signs of improvement in China, with production normalizing and Apple’s China retail stores reopened. But the rapid global spread of the virus raises questions about near-term demand, in particular, for iPhones. All of Apple’s retail stores outside China are now closed, and U.S. carriers are closing many of their own stores. That said, expectations are still high for the first generation of 5G-capable iPhones, which investors are expecting to arrive later this year.Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar this morning trimmed his price target on Apple shares to $260, from $343, while repeating his Overweight rating. Kumar chopped his financial outlook on the company, reducing his fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share estimate to $12.32 a share from $13.59, while trimming his fiscal 2021 view to $14.63 from $15.71. But he remains a bull on the stock. “We believe Apple’s diversified revenue stream should provide benefits in both the near and long-term, and we see 5G driving a major product cycle refresh across the company’s product line,” he wrote in a research note. “Given the suspected second-half launch, we believe the number of Apple 5G phones could be less impacted than others currently on the market today. Regardless of overall impact, we believe Apple is considered the cream of the crop for mobile phones...Longer-term, we envision the company’s other product sets could have 5G connectivity capabilities, which could drive additional product set refreshes down the line.”Kumar also points to the strength of the company’s balance sheet. “In times like these, we tend to prefer companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to generate solid free cash flow,” he wrote. “In our view, Apple is one of the strongest companies in our realm in this regard, as it has over $100 billion in net cash. Apple has also generated nearly $64 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months...Largely speaking, we believe Apple is well-prepared financially for an uncertain environment.” He also notes that Apple has $60 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization and could use the recent pullback to repurchase shares.

All Rights ReservedThe last time the S&P 500’s total dividends declined from the previous year was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Expect that to happen this year. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, says an overall decline in dividend payments in 2020 “is very feasible” due to the coronavirus pandemic. That warning marks a drastic turnabout from the start of the year, when Silverblatt was expecting dividend increases of about 9% for S&P 500 companies.Among the S&P 500 companies suspending their payouts so far this year:            Delta Air Lines      (ticker: DAL),            Boeing      (BA),            Ford Motor      (F) and            Freeport-McMoRan      (FCX). Dividend cuts were imposed by energy companies            Occidental Petroleum      (OXY) and            Apache      (APA).“More cuts and suspensions are expected, as companies move to limit expenses as cash-flow declines,” Silverblatt said in a note Tuesday.Among those companies that previously put through dividend increases in April are            Exxon Mobil      (XOM),            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ) and            Procter & Gamble      (PG). Investors will be watching these companies, and many others, closely to gauge trends. Dividends are considered an important signal for a company’s priorities.The top five S&P 500 dividend payers in terms of cash outlays are            Microsoft      (MSFT),            AT&T      (T), Exxon Mobil,            Apple      (AAPL), and            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM).Meanwhile, buyback suspensions have been more prevalent and are likely to increase. Among those suspending buybacks are eight large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase and            Bank of America      (BAC), and various other companies, including            Nordstrom      (JWN) and AT&T.First-quarter “buybacks should be significantly down, as the quarter was already half over when the virus hit the U.S,” Silverblatt said. Looking further out, he says, the second quarter and full year are expected to be dismal on buybacks. For context, S&P 500 companies bought back $728.7 billion of shares in 2019, down nearly 10% from the record $806.4 billion in 2018.There is also mounting political pressure to curtail stock buybacks. President Trump has said that any federal bailout money shouldn’t go to buybacks, and Democratic Presidential front-runner Joe Biden has called for a suspension of the practice for 12 months.

All Rights ReservedThe measures announced by the Federal Reserve in recent weeks to combat the coronavirus crisis are unprecedented in size and scope because the crisis itself is unlike any other the world has faced. While they build on the central bank’s response to the 2008-’09 financial crisis, they vastly exceed steps taken more than a decade ago to shore up the faltering U.S. economy.This time around, moreover, there is no debate about the need for government intervention. In 2008—and well beyond—dissenters questioned the wisdom and fairness of bailing out the corporate sector, and especially the nation’s banks.In setting up a dizzying array of alphabet-soup facilities to buy bonds and take other steps that expand upon programs introduced during the financial crisis, the Fed has extended its reach even further into the economy. And it has taken the central bank even farther afield from its traditional policy tool of buying government securities, the avenue through which it would pump funds into the financial system, which then would channel money into the private economy.At the same time, the Fed’s efforts now are coordinated to an even greater extent with fiscal policies to support an economy that slammed to a near-halt. Ironically, in echoes of 2008, Congressional wrangling is holding up a massive stimulus bill in the Senate, just as the measure to authorize the Troubled Assets Relief Program initially failed, with similarly negative consequences for the stock market.Based on Monday morning’s announcement of an array of new measures, the Fed has extended support directly to the corporate bond market and the municipal bond market. It has also agreed to lend directly to small businesses. That’s in addition to expanding its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in unlimited fashion, compared with the $500 billion and $200 billion originally announced when the Fed slashed its key federal-funds rate target to near-zero on Sunday, March 19.As James Bianco, head of Bianco Research, put it, “At first blush, it looks like they are nationalizing financial markets, except for equities and high-yield” bonds. Alternately, it appears the Fed has reached its Mario Draghi moment, echoing the former head of the European Central Bank in effectively declaring it will do whatever it takes to cushion the blows likely to result from the virtual shutdown of many sectors of the U.S. economy due to the spread of the coronavirus. The economic fallout from the virus crisis is already apparent. Economists at major banks are leapfrogging each other to estimate the extent of the decline in the U.S. economy in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley economists predict that gross domestic product could collapse at a 30.1% annual rate in the period; that compares with an 8.4% downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008 during the financial crisis, and an 11.1% contraction in 1946, with the end of World War II expenditures.The current crisis has been likened to wartime, and rightly so, given the upheaval in ordinary lives and household spending, and the huge disruption to American business. But a strong wartime economy, greased by fiscal stimulus, put Americans to work, even if their spending was curbed by rationing.Layoffs now are mounting from businesses that can’t operate with employees working from home. In but one stark example cited by Torsten Sløk, chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities, bookings at online restaurant-reservation services have fallen 100%, to zero.The fiscal-stimulus bill, now held up in the Senate, would provide an array of assistance totaling more than $2 trillion. According to Cowen’s Washington analyst, Chris Krueger, even this understates the total. The $500 billion “slush fund” to help industry, as he calls it, can be leveraged 10 times by the Fed through the various lending facilities it has announced. That would come to an astounding $7 trillion, or almost 10 times the stimulus provided in 2009 to fight the Great Recession after the financial crisis.Why such an unprecedented program would be necessary after 10-year economic expansion accompanied by a soaring stock market and record-tying low employment of 3.5% is perhaps an obvious question. After all, Corporate America supposedly had huge cash reserves, while U.S. households were flush from their equity holdings and the post-financial-crisis recovery in the value of their home.Yet corporate cash is largely concentrated in a few high-profile companies such as            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Microsoft      (MSFT), and            Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK.A), each of which has more than $100 billion in liquid assets on its balance sheet. Cash-rich companies generally risked becoming targets of activist investors, who would press management to return the cash to shareholders through stock buybacks, Sløk noted.With interest rates at historic lows, in part because of central-bank bond purchases, it was a no-brainer for many corporate-finance officers to borrow cheaply to repurchase stock. Share buybacks reduce share count and thereby increase earnings per share and, in turn, the share price.Many of the Fed’s new programs have been spurred by the resulting loss of financial flexibility in the current crisis. In addition to permitting the purchase of corporate bonds, these programs have revived the central bank’s support of the commercial paper market and money-market funds. At the same time, the Fed has extended its support to the state and local sectors by buying a range of municipal securities and tax-free money funds. Will all this work to stabilize the economy?“Relief for business and consumers may keep the economy afloat through the lockdowns now coming into force in the U.S.,” writes Jonas Golterman of Capital Economics in a client note. “And the Fed’s efforts will also help cushion the blow and shore up the financial system, limiting the risk that the pandemic triggers a full-blown financial crisis.”But only clear signs of success to bring the pandemic under control will bring about stability and recovery in the economy and the financial markets, he concludes.Previous crises have had financial and economic causes, and thus their cures were financial and economic in nature. Never before have monetary and fiscal policy makers had to deal with a public health problem which necessitated bringing the economy to a virtual halt. And so the Fed is acting like never before to provide credit in every corner to mitigate the economic fallout from the coronavirus. That buys crucial time during a period of self-quarantine. But it doesn’t provide a cure. Write to Randall W.

1,"Apple       shares have fallen below $1 trillion in market value for the first time since September. That leaves            Microsoft      as the only U.S. company with a valuation above the $1 trillion mark.Apple stock (ticker: AAPL), which fell 2% Monday to $224.37, has trumbled 31%—more than $100 a share—since peaking at $327.20 on Feb. 12. That is a loss in value of about $468 billion.Microsoft shares            ﻿      (MSFT) have held up a little better. The software giant’s stock is down about 28% in the recent market swoon, reducing the company’s market valuation to $1.04 trillion.Two other technology companies that briefly crossed the 13-digit valuation level have fallen well below the line. Amazon       (AMZN) shares have actually outperformed the broader market in the new bear market. While down about 14% from the stock’s February peak, Amazon shares are up slightly for the year, and on Monday rose 3.1% to $1,902.83. The company has a market cap of about $924 billion.Alphabet       (GOOGL) shares haven’t fared as well. The stock is down 34% in the current downdraft, and now has a market cap just under $700 billion. The stock fell 1.3% Monday.Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal trimmed his price target on Apple shares on Monday to $225 from $295, while keeping a Neutral rating on the stock. He cut his profit estimates on the company to $13.20 a share from $13.69 for the fiscal year ending in September, and to $15.35 from $15.69 for fiscal 2021.“Apple has closed all stores outside of China, though China has opened again,” Kvaal wrote in a research note. “Many operator stores in the U.S. and in Europe are also closed. AT&T and T-Mobile announced they are closing 40% and 80% of stores even before the U.S. lockdowns were in place. We do not expect online sales to make up much of the loss; we believe online comprises only 10-15% of phone sales.” Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedNetflix      shares continue to outperform the market, as investors scan for stocks likely to benefit from the growing number of people around the world who are home bound in the face of the spreading coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, Baird analyst William Power lifted his rating on Netflix (ticker: NFLX) to Outperform from Neutral, boosting his target price to $415, from $350. In the same call, he cut his ratings on both            AT&T      (T) and            Comcast      (CMCSA) to Neutral from Outperform. Power’s view is that the lack of live sports and growing economic pressures could accelerate cord-cutting — and that Netflix will be a “key beneficiary.”Power writes that Netflix’s view that it continues to take market share from linear TV “never looked truer,” with recent survey results suggesting “strong current subscriber trends.” He adds that while he “had previously been concerned with pricing power due to new entrants like            Disney      DIS,            Apple      AAPL, etc., we believe the narrative could shift toward greater revenue leverage from subscriber upside.”Power contends that Netflix will be “one of the pre-eminent stay-at-home winners, with the current environment enabling it to widen its global lead...While free cash flow losses are of heightened investor focus and remain a risk, we expect free cash flow losses to continue to improve, which should allay some concerns.”Meanwhile, in a new note sharply cutting estimates for most big internet companies, RBC Capital’s Mark Mahaney kept his outlook for Netflix profits unchanged. “We believe Netflix is the most insulated from a virus-induced recession as more regions around the world adopt varying degrees of social distancing,” he writes. “We believe given its high-value/low-cost value proposition, subscription-based revenue, and high customer satisfaction/retention rate, Netflix should continue to be recession-resistant.”Not everyone is convinced. Needham analyst Laura Martin on Monday morning repeated her Underperform rating on the stock, writing that she continues to worry about the company’s balance sheet and potential liquidity issues given her projection of $2 billion to $4 billion of negative free cash flow in 2000. She thinks            Roku (ROKU)      offers a better bet on streaming video, and repeated her Buy rating and $200 target on the stock.Netflix shares on Monday were up 5.5%, to $351.06. The stock is up about 10% for the year to date. Roku was up 7.3%, to $81.72. AT&T, meanwhile, as down 6.9%, to $26.49, and Comcast was off 1.7%, to $32.81. Write to Eric J.

0,"Social distancing and other efforts to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in countries around the world are effectively slamming the brakes on the global economy. The impact on companies’ earnings in coming quarters will undoubtedly be negative, but quantifying just how bad it will get is exceedingly difficult at this stage. Investors clearly fear the worst, having sent U.S. stock indexes down by almost a third over just the past month.First-quarter results may be mixed depending on the industry, as many of the canceled events, bans on travel, and tumbling consumer activity outside of China didn’t kick in until mid-March. Airlines, hotels, and other transportation and leisure companies are already facing intense pressure. But grocery stores and consumer goods companies may report a blockbuster March, as people rushed to stock up on food and supplies. But that’s likely more than priced in.            Kroger      (ticker: KR) and            Clorox      (CLX) are among the best-performing stocks during the market’s recent meltdown. Even            Walmart      stock (WMT) hit an all-time high on Wednesday.For the        S&P 500      more broadly, first-quarter consensus earnings estimates are down 4.1% since late January, when coronavirus news began to pick up. They now imply a 1.3% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings per share in the first quarter, according to Yardeni Research.Managements’ forward guidance and commentary about the second quarter and the rest of 2020 will clearly be more important—and potentially much uglier. The consensus has been for S&P 500 earnings per share to be 2.7% higher in the second quarter of 2020 than they were in the same period in 2019, per Yardeni. That’s highly unlikely as things appear today.For all of 2020, analysts on aggregate still see 6.1% growth for S&P 500 earnings per share, with their average forecast down just 2.3% since late January.Analysts might be waiting to hear from companies directly before adjusting their forecasts. According to Credit Suisse’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, only 15% of Wall Street analysts have changed their estimates since the start of last week. Those that have see an 0.7% drop in 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share on average.“As the estimate cuts continue to ramp up in the coming weeks, those growth forecasts will turn negative too,” wrote economist Ed Yardeni, who is president of Yardeni Research, on Wednesday. “The question is whether the same can be said for Q3 and Q4.”If the coronavirus outbreak is under control by the second half of the year and life and economic activity is allowed to resume, many companies could see a rebound in their business that makes up for some of the losses in the second quarter. Apple      (AAPL) may be losing out on iPhone sales while its stores are currently closed, but a shopper may simply buy the same device once they reopen. For airlines, restaurants, and many other businesses, the catch-up effect won’t be nearly as strong. Coffee-drinkers won’t buy two            Starbucks      (SBUX) lattés a day in June and July to make up for the ones they missed in April and May. Many energy companies will suffer unless the price of oil rebounds strongly.And there is always the still-unknowable possibility that the coronavirus impact lasts well into late 2020.Evercore macro research analyst Dennis DeBusschere likewise expects a steady stream of downward revisions to earnings-per-share estimates in the coming weeks. He notes that even if S&P 500 revenues remain flat over the full year, per-share per share can still fall significantly. For starters, profit margins are likely to contract as one-off expenses rise and productivity falls across the economy. Many companies are taking steps to support employees, which will also dent margins.“Some mega-cap corporations are committing to paying employees as if business was operating as usual such as Apple, Walmart, or            Amazon.com      (AMZN),” DeBusschere wrote on Tuesday. “Those policies, while a welcome support for individuals and spending in the broader economy, will be a significant drag on profitability.”Plus, many companies eager to conserve cash are pausing their stock-buyback programs. That means share counts will decrease less than currently forecast, and earnings-per-share growth estimates will come down even more.And the most economically sensitive cyclical companies will feel the greatest burden from the coronavirus disruption. Those firms were both the largest contributors to earnings growth and the greatest contributors to buybacks in the S&P 500.The rapid tumble in U.S. stocks has made a wide swath of the market suddenly appear attractive on a price-to-forward-earnings multiple basis. But take those ratios with a grain of salt. Analysts still have much catching up to do.First-quarter earnings season kicks off in mid-April with major banks reporting first, as usual. The results will be even more telling than usual.

0,"In the days before coronavirus, when markets were hitting new highs, technology stocks were the tip of the spear. Just a few weeks ago, there were four U.S. companies with market valuations above $1 trillion, all of them tech stocks. Those companies—            Microsoft       (ticker: MSFT),            Apple      (AAPL),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and Google parent            Alphabet      (GOOGL)—with their fortress-solid balance sheets, are poised to come out of the downturn just as strong as they went in. But for intrepid tech investors, there are less obvious opportunities to be found amid the current carnage and chaos.To help find the best ideas, Barron’s reached out to a few of our favorite tech-focused stockpickers. Some clear themes run through their recommendations: The work-from-home revolution underlines the power of cloud computing; we all still need to be entertained, even if we’re stuck at home; and we’re still going to need broadband, now more than ever.Here’s what the experts have to say: David Readerman Readerman is proprietor of Endurance Capital Partners, a San Francisco–based tech hedge fund. Readerman has zeroed in on cloud plays. “What’s certainly being reinforced right now,” he says, “is that cloud-based information-technology architecture is providing agility and resiliency for companies to operate dispersed workforces.”Readerman says the jury is out on whether there’s a lasting impact on how we work, but he adds that contingency planning now requires the ability to work remotely for extended periods. Among his cloud software picks are            DocuSign      (DOCU), a provider of digital-signature software, and            Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), the videoconferencing company that has been one of the year’s best stocks. “If there was ever doubt about the migration of the enterprise to cloud platforms, Covid-19 has proved its capabilities,” he says.Readerman concedes that Zoom’s valuation looks extreme—the stock trades at 34 times Wall Street’s sales estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2022—but he says there’s an opportunity for Zoom to monetize its surge in new users. He thinks that Zoom can expand beyond videoconferencing to offer a wider range of tools. “Zoom reminds me of AOL when it was everywhere, with ease of use and the freemium model,” he says.Readerman is bullish, too, on data center operators like            Equinix       (EQIX) and            Digital Realty Trust      (DLR). On the more speculative side, he likes their smaller rivals,            CyrusOne      (CONE) and            CoreSite Realty       (COR), which could be consolidation targets. He says that            Equinix      is seeing a surge in traffic to its servers, another sign of the growth of the cloud-computing trend. “Grocery stores are sold out of toilet paper, and we all need more broadband,” he says. Companies like            Equinix,      he adds, are “the critical on/off ramp for internet-based connectivity and commerce.” Rich Greenfield Greenfield, the co-founder of research boutique LightShed Partners, has covered entertainment and media companies for 25 years. His coverage universe was dealing with disruption—the technological kind—long before coronavirus, but the pandemic is creating a set of more serious challenges, with movie theaters and theme parks closed, sports shuttered, and ad budgets crunched. Greenfield notes that 12 of the top 50 TV advertisers are ailing auto makers; another 11 are quick-serve restaurant chains. The lack of sports content is particularly problematic on the advertising front. The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was canceled, and the National Basketball Association season, Major League Baseball, and the Olympics have all been delayed. There is no clarity on when the event calendar will pick up—and when people will be comfortable in public settings. “How long does it last?” Greenfield asks. “Does the stimulus ward off a recession or depression? It’s hard to tell. No one knows how to forecast this.”But people still crave entertainment, and that’s keeping Greenfield bullish on            Netflix      (NFLX). Unlike most content companies, Netflix sells no ads. And while movie and TV production is shut, Netflix has several months of new content ready to go. “They’re in a really strong position relative to their peers,” he says, pointing to            Walt Disney      (DIS), which has been battered on multiple fronts—its ESPN has no sports to show, its theme parks are closed, and it has no open theaters through which to distribute films. The weak ad market, meanwhile, is problematic for Disney’s broadcast and cable properties.Says Greenfield: “More people are using Netflix than ever before.” He notes that the number of subscribers is accelerating, which isn’t surprising given all of the home-bound people with more hours to fill and no sports to watch. He says Netflix will benefit from people switching to more expensive multiple-user plans and from reduced churn, or cancellations. In coming quarters, he says, Netflix will have “higher subscriptions, higher average revenue per user, and better free cash flow than people think.” Greenfield is also bullish on            Twitter      (TWTR), which this past week warned that revenue for its March quarter would be down year over year, as ad budgets fall. But, he notes, Twitter is seeing record usage. While profits and revenue will take a near-term hit, he points out that Twitter can withstand the crisis, with $6.6 billion in cash. And the company is poised to benefit from a crowded events calendar once the virus threat ebbs. “There aren’t enough weekends on the calendar for all the stuff coming down from September through summer 2021,” Greenfield says, with spring sporting events shifted to the fall, a packed film-release schedule, and the November election. “It’s absurd.” And he thinks it will all drive traffic—and ad dollars—to Twitter.  Paul Meeks Meeks wears multiple hats, as a portfolio manager for Independent Solutions Wealth Management, an asset management firm in Williamsville, N.Y., and a manager of The Wireless Fund, a small tech mutual fund. Meeks say that he has been using the recent rally to raise cash, while dabbling in marquee names and “banking proceeds for a better day.” Meeks says that he’s waiting until “earnings estimates are slashed to the bone” before making substantial new commitments. “I need to see them all confess all their sins, and to take down numbers dramatically.” In the meantime, Meeks has been nibbling on megacaps, specifically Amazon and            Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA), both of which he thinks will benefit from the expanded role that e-commerce will play in the post-coronavirus world. Eventually, he says, when earnings estimates reset, he wants to own his “dream team of semiconductor stocks,” including            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD),            Lam Research      (LRCX),            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing      (TSM),            Micron Technology      (MU), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT), where he expects to go from basically zero to a big overweight. Meanwhile, Meeks is bullish on            Virtu Financial      (VIRT), a New York–based tech-driven financial trading platform. Meeks sees the company as a play on volatility. He notes that Virtu trades for about 10 times earnings and pays a “fairly certain” dividend, currently yielding 4.3%. “When stocks go up endlessly again, and investors are complacent, they become an average company again,” he says. But, for now, Virtu will benefit as long as we continue to see “whipsaw moves in both directions.” Dan Niles Niles is founder and portfolio manager for the Satori Fund, a tech-focused hedge fund. On Feb. 17, just after Apple pulled its March quarter guidance, Niles tweeted that he had 50% of his portfolio short Apple, seven of the company’s suppliers, and        QQQ,      an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. It was a prescient call. Niles remains generally bearish on the market, but there are stocks he likes and owns, particularly around videogames. While Niles thinks the market has exaggerated the impact of a fifth-generation, or 5G, iPhone launch later this year, he sees opportunity in a less-watched product cycle: new videogame consoles from Microsoft and            Sony      (SNE), expected this fall. “They’re going to launch the first new hardware platforms since 2013, and everyone is stuck at home,” he says. “I like them all,” he says of the videogame stocks, including            Zynga      (ZNGA),            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO), and            Electronic Arts      (EA), along with China’s            NetEase      (NTES) and            Tencent Holdings      (700.Hong Kong).Other Niles bets are Amazon, a beneficiary from the shift to e-commerce, and work-at-home play            RingCentral      (RNG), a cloud-based communications provider. Meanwhile, he’s still ready to short Apple again as the stock rallies. For one thing, he says, “I don’t know who is going to feel rich enough to buy an iPhone.” And he wonders why anyone would pay 19 times current earnings for Apple, when other hardware plays like            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ) trade for just seven times.  Craig Moffett Moffett, founder of the research boutique MoffettNathanson, is the market’s most influential telecom and cable seer. He predicts deep issues for some of the largest companies he covers, notably            AT&T      (T) and            Comcast      (CMCSA), given their exposure to ad-supported content through their respective WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal segments. AT&T and Comcast are getting a boost from their broadband units, but Moffett sees better ways to play that trend.He’s bullish on            Charter Communications      (CHTR) and            Altice USA       (ATUS), both pure plays on the cable business and, therefore, free of ad-supported content worries. Charter is down 13% over the past month. “The fact that Charter has sold off as much as the broader market makes no sense at all,” Moffett says. “The cable companies are simply digital infrastructure providers. They are agnostic about how you can get your video content. And the broadband business is going to be just fine.” He says that Altice, while a little riskier than Charter, is even cheaper. Both companies are seeing demand for faster—and more expensive—broadband plans, with parents and children spending so many hours at home. Moffett thinks that Altice could rally 40% to 50%, while Charter could rise 30% to 40%. Moffett is also bullish on            T-Mobile US      (TMUS), which is about to be a strong No. 3 player in the U.S. wireless market after it closes a pending deal to buy            Sprint      (S). “They’ll be very well positioned, with line of sight to cost savings and margin expansion, and network advantages that should translate into market-share gains for years and years to come,” he says. And while Moffett still sees some risk to the deal’s completion, he thinks that T-Mobile is attractive with or without Sprint.  Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedRevenue and profit estimates for the semiconductor industry continue to ratchet lower, amid a range of both supply-chain and demand issues. And the same process is under way for the chip equipment makers that serve them. But for both sectors, there are values to find if you know where to look.This morning, UBS chip analyst Timothy Arcuri reset estimates for his entire coverage universe, which includes all of the major chip and equipment companies. For most of the companies he covers, he reduced revenue forecasts for both 2020 and 2021, and he brought price targets down for most of the stocks he covers as well. He also shifted some ratings around. In a few cases, he’s feeling more bullish.Arcuri notes that revenue for the semiconductor industry fell 35% in two quarters during the 2008-09 downturn, and took three quarters to fully recover. But he adds that comparisons are easier this time, coming off a weak 2019, especially for memory chips. He writes that his new base case is for a 20% drop in semiconductor revenues through the September quarter with a gradual recovery to parity by June 2021. Calendar 2020 revenues, he says, will be off 15%-20% from pre-virus estimates. He adds that “computer” related stocks—            Intel       (ticker: INTC) and            Nvidia       (NVDA), for instance—should be more defensive, and that supply constraints should help on memory. (He likes            Micron.      ) But he sees risks for smartphone-related stocks, and weakness in the automotive chip sector.For the equipment sector, he says, revenue will follow semis lower, but he’s more bullish on the group than he is on chips. He says that “supply constraints should keep order books full making the snap-back faster than for semis,” and he adds that there are “few if any weak balance sheets among top chip spenders.” Arcuri also notes that Chinese customers “remain full speed ahead and may even accelerate timeliness.”Arcuri on Friday lifted his ratings on            Lam Research      (LRCX) to Buy from Sell and on            KLA       (KLAC) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) to Neutral from Sell. He also upgrades            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Neutral from Sell.His bullish stance on Lam reflects the company’s out-sized exposure to the memory sector. He writes that Applied has growing exposure to memory, though he is concerned about the company’s display business, and he sees risk in its large exposure to the contract chip manufacturer            Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM). He says KLA should get a boost from supply constraint issues in the equipment sector, though he thinks the story in the foundry and logic end markets—where KLA has significant exposure—isn’t as compelling as it is for memory.On Texas Instruments, Arcuri says that he still has concerns about their big exposure to the automotive and industrial vertical markets, but that the issue is already reflected in the stock price. “Virtually all of the company’s revenue growth over the past 4 years has come from this vertical so this remains a concern as we look forward but the sell side has also been aggressively cutting global production estimates over the past few weeks and highly visible production shut-downs in Europe make it hard to argue that investors have not contemplated this as a risk,” he writes.In Friday trading, amid a sharp market slide, chip and equipment stocks are trading lower across the board, with Lam, Arcuri’s favorite, down 6.4%, to $243.42.

0,"Semiconductor shares were leading the market higher on a strong rebound day for the broader market Tuesday, as analysts and investors sort through the rubble of the downturn looking for likely winners coming out it. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised his rating Tuesday morning on            Nvidia       shares (ticker: NVDA) to Buy from Hold, setting a price target of $270. “We acknowledge it’s risky to upgrade a stock given this vicious pandemic and the subsequent economic fallout,” he writes in a research note. “However, during this uncertain time, we believe investors will flock to companies with superior balance sheets and robust free cash flow. Nvidia fits the bill.”Gill expects a pickup in demand for Nvidia graphics processors used for medical research applications in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. “GPUs can accelerate the analysis of whole genomes, which consist of 3 billion base pairs in human chromosomes, from days to less than one hour,” he writes. Gill also notes that with the stock down 35% from its peak as of Monday’s close, the stock trades at a multiyear P/E low.Goldman Sachs chip analyst Toshiya Hari chopped estimates across the board on Tuesday for both chip companies and semiconductor-equipment stocks—but he has a few stocks to recommend. Hari’s estimate cuts are driven by recent downward revisions in the outlook for key markets served by the chip industry. Goldman Sachs sees smartphone shipments this year down 1.4% from 2019, personal computer shipments off 10% and automotive sales down 3.5%. Hari writes that he has taken an approach of cutting estimates based on how various groups have fared in past recessions. “While we take no view on the development of Covid-19 and the impact it could have on end demand, and in turn, the semiconductor industry, we believe it is prudent to assume a peak-to-trough correction that is consistent with past downturns.”In reviewing the group, Hari shuffled some ratings, lifting his stance on            Xilinx       (XLNX) to Buy from Neutral and            Intel      (INTC) to Neutral from Sell. But he cut            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Sell from Neutral, and            Cabot Microelectronics      (CCMP) to Neutral from Buy. He also removed            Applied Materials      (AMAT) from Goldman’s conviction list, while keeping his Buy rating on the equipment company.Xilinx makes field-programmable gate arrays, parts used in communications, data center, aerospace and other applications. While Hari says Xilinx isn’t immune to a downturn, he contends that the underperformance of Xilinx shares over the past 3, 6 and 12 months reduces the stock’s risk. He thinks fundamentals in the communications sector are “at or near trough,” and writes that data center remains “a secular growth business.” Hari contends that other key sectors for Xilinx—aerospace and defense—in addition to test and instruments are less economically sensitive than other chip end markets. The analyst also notes that Xilinx, as a chip maker that doesn’t operate its own factories, “has historically demonstrated relative gross margin stability during economic downturns” and that “relative valuation multiples are near-trough” levels. Hari concludes that any signs of improving earnings should drive an outsize gain in Xilinx shares. For Texas Instruments, Hari cut his price target to $88 from $123. He notes that the stock is often perceived as a haven, but that weakness in many of its key end markets as well as “above-peer operating leverage,” given it operates its own factories, “should pressure margins over the next few quarters and drive negative earnings-per-share revisions in excess of those for its peers.”As for Intel, Hari writes that there are “multiple near-term positive developments that could largely offset the headwinds,” including resilience in the server market and potentially in personal computers as more people work and study from home. But he says that because of increased competition, growing capital intensity and pressure on margins, he would avoid overweighting the stock.The downgrade of Cabot Micro, Hari says, reflects a special situation. The company’s core electronics materials business, which makes slurries used in chip-making, “is a high-growth, high margin business with a deep/wide competitive moat, and one that we continue to view positively long term.” But the company also makes drag reducing agents, or DRAs, used by oil pipelines. And he sees Cabot feeling the impact on that business as oil pipeline operators in the Permian Basin reduce their use of DRAs. Hari notes that Cabot is down 78% from its highs in February, but that “uncertainty surrounding the DRA business” will likely “weigh on multiples for the foreseeable future.”Near midday Tuesday, Nvidia was up 18%, Intel up 7.5% and Xilinx gained 6.2%. Texas Instruments rallied 5.4%, Cabot climbed 4% and Applied Materials jumped 12.6%. The        PHLX Semiconductor Stock Index      (SOX) rallied 10% and the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      had climbed 8.6%. Write to Eric J.

0," A week ago, dividends looked relatively safe across many industries—the operative words being “a week ago.” While Barron’s last week explored a few sectors that had been hit hard by the surging coronavirus outbreak and the oil selloff, the breadth of the contagion’s impact was seen as limited.Since then, the outbreak has brought U.S. business to a near-standstill and the broader picture has worsened for dividend safety as a severe recession looms. Iconic companies such as            Boeing      (ticker: BA) are now facing severe financial stress, and            Exxon Mobil      (XOM) wasn’t generating enough cash flow to cover its dividend even before the coronavirus emerged in the U.S.“Dividend cuts are inevitable,” says Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors. “Dividends are a function of cash flow, and cash flows will undoubtedly come under intense pressure.”Some companies are already making moves to preserve cash.            Allegiant Travel      (ALGT), which operates a small airline, on Wednesday said it was suspending its dividend and stock buybacks. That move follows Sunday’s announcement by eight major banks that they would suspend their stock-repurchase programs. David Trainer, CEO of investment-research firm New Constructs, expects there will be more freezes, cuts, and suspensions “the longer and deeper the economic contraction continues.” Without cash flow, he adds, “many companies will not be able to support their dividends.”Still, it’s early days in understanding the impact on companies and predicting how many companies’ payouts could be in peril is difficult. By way of comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis and recession, 40 S&P 500 companies cut their dividends and 22 announced suspensions, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The following year cuts rose to 68, and there were 10 suspensions. However, 151 companies, or 30% of the S&P 500, did notch dividend increases that year as the economy emerged from recession and the stock market began its (recently ended) bull run.Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Dow Jones Indices, expects companies whose sales and cash flow are hit the most by the crisis “to suspend or minimize their dividends, with others keeping increases to a minimum.”To that point, even during the coronavirus crisis, some companies are increasing their payouts. On March 13, tech company            Applied Materials      (AMAT) announced that it will boost its quarterly payout by a penny, or nearly 5%, to 22 cents a share.For dividend safety and the overall coronavirus crisis, time is the enemy.“We don’t know how long we will be in this situation, and of course the longer it goes on, the more stress there will be in the system,” says Lee Spelman, head of U.S. equities at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.She expects that many companies will halt share buybacks as a first step to persevere cash, as large banks did earlier this week. “We also know that there are likely going to be dividend cuts from some of the more financially stretched and vulnerable companies,” Spelman adds.“It is difficult to say definitively that any sector is immune to these events,” she says, though energy companies have been hit hard and that’s “where we see the biggest dividend cuts.” The oil patch is fighting a war on two fronts: the coronavirus and falling oil prices.Many large banks have halted stock buybacks as a precaution with short-term interest rates near zero. But “balance sheets are in much better shape than during the 2008-09 period and right now we are not expecting any dividend cuts,” she says.Spelman offers this advice: “Now is the time to keep a sharp eye on the financial conditions of every stock you own.” Write to Lawrence C.

1,"As the coronavirus spreads beyond China, Italy and South Korea are focal points for investors worried about the growing scope of the outbreak. Barron’s dug into U.S.-listed companies with exposure to those two countries.We looked at all stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges and trade at least 100,000 shares a day, on average. Of those stocks, four were companies that generated at least 10% of 2019 revenue from Italy, where at least 322 people had been confirmed to have contracted the virus and 10 have died as of Tuesday afternoon.  Barron’s found 18 U.S.-listed companies that get at least 10% of revenue from South Korea, where the World Health Organization counts 763 cases and 7 deaths. (The virus is also spreading in Iran, but sanctions limit U.S. companies’ activity there).Here is a look at the U.S. companies most exposed to Italy and South Korea. ITALY  International Game Technology      (ticker: IGT)  The electronic-gaming equipment and software maker, based in London, gets more than a third of its revenue (37.6%) from Italy. Since the start of the year, the stock has tumbled 18%. Much of that decline came this week, as global indexes slid on virus fears. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.86. For reference, the        S&P 500       has a P/E of 20.8. Dana       (DAN)  This Ohio-based company makes power-conveyance and energy-management solutions for vehicles. About 14% of its sales come from Italy. Like IGT, Dana has dropped 18% since the beginning of January. It is trading at 5.2 times earnings.  Guess       (GES)  Italy accounts for 12% of revenue for the apparel company. The stock has fallen 17% this year. With a P/E of 15.9, it is still relatively expensive compared with other U.S. stocks exposed to Italy.  CNH Industrial      (CNHI)  The agricultural-equipment and commercial-vehicle maker, based in London, derives 11% of total sales from Italy. The stock was up slightly on Tuesday amid a sea of red, but it is still down 20% since the start of January. CNH is trading at a P/E of 8.8.  SOUTH KOREA  Universal Display      (OLED)  The maker of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), based in New Jersey, gets 62% of its revenue from Korea. Investors have taken the stock—which gained 126% in 2019—lower by 25% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 53.9. Xperi       (XPER)  For the San Jose semiconductor company, South Korea accounts for 52% of sales. The stock has fallen 3% since the start of 2020, a loss that appears contained in part because it has given up 26% over the past 12 months.  Onto Innovation      (ONTO)  The chip company, based in Massachusetts, gets a third of its revenue from South Korea. The stock has dropped 8% this year but is holding on to a 14% gain over the past 12 months. It is trading at 63.4 times earnings.  MagnaChip Semiconductor      (MX)  The Luxembourg-based company also gets about a third of total sales from Korea. Despite a 13% decline this week, shares are up 9% since the start of January.  Photronics      (PLAB)  This one is another chip company, based in Connecticut. It derives 27% of revenue from Korea. The stock has lost 20% this year after gaining 62% in 2019. Its P/E stands at 27.9. Silicon Motion Technology      (SIMO)  This Hong Kong-based chip maker gets a quarter of total revenue from Korea. Its stock has fallen 20% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 20.2. Ceva       (CEVA)  For the Mountain View, Calif.,-based company, 24% of sales come from Korea. Though down 10% this week, this one is up 11% on the year.  Lam Research      (LRCX)  Another California chip maker, Lam derives 23% of sales from Korea. Another highflier in recent years, the stock is down 7% this week. It is holding on to a 0.7% gain for the year and is trading at a P/E of 21.1. Coherent Inc.      (COHR)  The California-based industrial laser company derives 22% of revenue from Korea. The stock is down 21% since the start of the year and is trading at a P/E of 88.9. FormFactor      (FORM)  The semiconductor maker, also based in California, gets a fifth of its revenue from Korea. The stock, still up 40% over the past 12 months, is down 11% since the beginning of the year. Its P/E stands at 45. Nu Skin Enterprises       (NUS)  Based in Provo, Utah, Nu Skin sells personal-care products and nutritional supplements, deriving 14% of its revenue from Korea. Shares have dropped 35% this year, bringing the loss over the past 12 months to 58%. The stock is trading at 8.9 times earnings.  Acushnet Holdings      (GOLF)  For the golf-products maker, which owns the Titleist brand and is based in Massachusetts, Korea makes up 14% of total sales. The stock has declined 16% this year and is trading at a P/E of 18.2. Applied Materials      (AMAT)  The California chip maker derives 13% of revenue from Korea. The stock gained 82% in 2019 and has hung onto most of that gain. Year-to-date, shares are down 3.5%. It trades at a P/E of 19.3. KLA Corp. (KLAC)  KLA is another California semiconductor company, reliant on Korea for 13% of its sales. Shares have declined 16% since January, leaving its gain over the past 12 months at 29%. The stock trades at a P/E of 17.3. eBay Inc.      (EBAY)  For the online auction platform, Korea represents 11% of revenue. The stock has slipped 4% this week but is still up 1.5% on the year, following reports it may sell its classified-ads business for around $10 billion. eBay has a P/E of 14.5. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  This Massachusetts chip company also gets 11% of its revenue from South Korea. Shares are down 12% since the start of the year after gaining 78% in 2019. Skyworks P/E stands at 20.3. Synopsys      (SNPS)  A 10th of this electronic design company’s revenue comes from Korea. The California company’s stock has fallen 5.2% this week but is hanging onto a 1.8% gain for the year. It is trading at 41.4 times earnings. Lumentum Holdings      (LITE)  The optical and photonic product maker, based in California, derives 10% of overall sales from Korea. Shares in the company have fallen 1.1% this year after gaining 53% in 2019. Its P/E stands at 47.03.

1,"After last week’s sharp selloff of U.S. stocks, investors should take advantage of the market’s extremely oversold condition, Evercore ISI says. All three major U.S. stock indexes rebounded over 4% on Monday as investors hoped global central banks would provide support if needed and bargain hunters swooped into the market. But the market still has far to go before it can recoup last week’s steep losses.High-quality stocks with stable earnings and low exposure to the coronavirus outbreak could be a safer place to hide and a good bet for the early phases of a market rebound, Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a Sunday note.The list includes            Mastercard      (MA),            Visa      (V), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) in tech,            Boston Scientific      (BSX),            Humana      (HUM), and            Biogen      (BIIB) in health care,            Home Depot      (HD),            Lowe’s      (LOW), and            TJX      (TJX) in consumer discretionary, as well as            Costco Wholesale      (COST) and            Kroger      (KR) in consumer staples.

1,"Tech giant            Apple      sent shares around the globe reeling with a warning that it wouldn’t meet its quarterly financial guidance because of the coronavirus outbreak in China. “World-wide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained,” read Monday’s news release. Apple (ticker: AAPL) also said demand for its product inside of China is being affected as well. Hong Kong’s        Hang Seng Index      fell 1.5%, leaving it down about 1% for the week after rising Monday. U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for the President’s Day holiday. The U.K.’s        FTSE 100 Index      was down 0.8%, for a loss of about 0.5% for the week. Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures fell about 0.5% Tuesday morning.        S&P 500      futures were off about 0.4%. Futures on the technology-heavy        Nasdaq Composite      lost about 0.7%. Apple stock was down about 3.3% in premarket trading. Other technology stocks are falling as well.            Nvidia      (NVDA) shares, for instance, were down 1.7%.            Intel      stock was off 1.2%. Semiconductor capital equipment supplier            Applied Materials       (AMAT) shares were down about 3.9% in premarket trading. Stock in food company            Conagra Brands      (CAG) lost about 4%. The drop isn’t because of the virus. The company, however, like Apple, provided a disappointing update to investors Monday. “Consumption softness in the quarter first emerged in the food service industry, with holiday restaurant traffic weaker than last year.” said CEO Sean Connolly in the company’s news release. Conagra now expects to earn about $2.04 a share for the 2020 fiscal year ending in May. Analysts’ financial models predicted $2.10 in per-share earnings. It isn’t all bad news Tuesday morning. Grocery chain            Kroger      (KR) shares were up 6.3% in premarket trading. Warren Buffett’s            Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK.A) disclosed a stake in the company late last week. Buffett’s reputation for identifying undervalued stocks is often enough to push shares higher when new Berkshire positions are disclosed. And stock in industrial conglomerate            Eaton      (ETN) rose 1.1% in premarket trading after            UBS      upgraded shares to the equivalent of Buy from Hold.

1,"Applied Materials      stock will rise due to better-than-expected profits over the next year,            Deutsche Bank      says. The chip equipment maker is slated to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings results on Wed. Feb. 12. On Sunday, Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho raised his rating for Applied Materials (ticker: AMAT) to Buy from Hold. He also increased his price target to $72 a share from $60.“We see upside to both Bloomberg consensus EPS earnings per share estimates and valuation multiples,” he wrote. “We believe AMAT offers the best risk-reward among large cap names in the space.”Applied Materials shares were up 3.1% to $59.80 on Monday.The analyst cited how the company’s key customers, such as            Intel      (INTC) and            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing      (TSM), have given strong capital expenditure guidance. As a result, he predicts upside for Applied Materials’ January results and April guidance versus the Street.“We believe AMAT’s valuation is the most reasonable...among large cap peers,” he added.

0,"In the latest signal that the chip industry is headed for a pick up in demand after a weak 2019, the world’s leading chip manufacturer for hire reported strong fourth-quarter results, better-than-expected first-quarter guidance, and spending plans for 2020 that should please investors in semiconductor-equipment stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM) posted fourth-quarter revenue of $10.39 billion, up 10.6% both from a year ago and from the third quarter, but slightly below the Street consensus forecast at $10.46 billion. Profits were 73 cents a share, ahead of the Street consensus view at 71 cents.“Our fourth quarter business benefited from strong demand for high-end smartphones, initial 5G deployment and high performance computing related applications using TSMC’s industry-leading 7-nanometer technology,” TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said in a statement. “Moving into first quarter 2020, despite mobile product seasonality, we anticipate our business to be supported by the continued ramp of 5G smartphones.”For the first quarter, the company sees revenue of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion, above the previous Wall Street analyst consensus at $10.1 billion. TSMC sees gross margin of 48.5% to 50.5%, versus 50.2% in the fourth quarter, and slightly above guidance, with operating margin of 37.5% to 39.5%, which compares with 39.2% in the fourth quarter, and just ahead of the guidance range.TSMC projects a capital spending budget this year of $15 billion to $16 billion, up from the $14.9 billion the company spent in 2019, a number that itself was about $400 million above Street estimates.  Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini this morning reiterated his Positive rating on the stock, lifting his target on TSMC’s shares to $74 from $70. He notes that the company’s strong Q1 guidance reflects growing demand for chips used in both 5G and high-performance computing applications. He notes that the stock has recently come under some selling pressure on fears of trade issues and advises investors to buy the stock here. Citi analyst Atif Malik writes in a brief research note this morning that TSMC’s spending plans are well above his previous projection of $14.5 billion. Malik notes that TSMC said it expects to spend 80% of its 2020 capex budget on advanced process technologies—at 7nm line widths and smaller—and adds that the company’s robust spending plans comes as good news for the semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector.Malik notes that TSMC expects 5G and high-performance computing applications to drive strong demand over the next several years. The company sees 20% growth this year for smartphones and high-performance computing, with mid-teens growth for automotive applications and wearables. Stifel analyst Patrick Ho likewise comments in a research note this morning that TSMC’s spending plans are “a modest upside surprise” for semiconductor equipment stocks. Some chip investors get nervous when chipmakers are spending on new capacity; the industry tends to overshoot and create price-crushing over-supply. But Ho isn’t worried. “Ultimately, while some may be concerned over this high forecast of capex and equipment spending, we believe that strong demand in these markets and differentiated and leading process technology is driving this capex spend,” he writes. “Customers need to pay for this capacity increase if the demand is as healthy and robust as TSMC and other forecasters see,” Ho says. “More importantly, we believe some of these demand trends could be sustainable and could keep capex elevated going into 2021. This upside surprise is part of our overall favorable sentiment entering 2020 and we maintain our positive view on the group and the stocks at this time.”TSMC shares were recently up slightly to $58.52. Among semiconductor equipment stocks,            Applied Materials      (AMAT),            KLA       (KLAC), and            Teradyne      (TER) are all up about 1%.

1,"Everyone loves a comeback story. Especially investors.To identify the stock market’s best 2019 comebacks, Barron’s ranked the companies in the        S&P 500      index by their 2018 and 2019 price changes. We then calculated the difference in the price changes to come up with the best improvements. It’s worth noting that a stock that falls 50% one year, needs to gain 100% in the following year to reach break-even.Lam Research      (ticker: LRCX) topped the list. It soared 117% in 2019, following a 26% decline in 2018, for a delta of 143 percentage points.Chips and chip equipment makers dominate the list of comeback stocks, reflecting what bulls think will be an upturn in memory chip demand starting in 2020. Investors are hoping that 5G wireless services will drive an uptick in mobile phone sales, along with a pickup in chip demand from public cloud companies. Here’s a list of the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with the most dramatic reversals of fortune. (The data reflect the stocks’ closing prices on Dec. 26.) Lam Research (LRCX)  Price change, by year  2018: -26%,  2019: +117%  Lam’s rebound was part of a broad 2019 recovery in companies that make chip manufacturing hardware. Lam expects to see a pickup in spending on memory chip manufacturing in 2020 and beyond, with continued stable demand from logic chip companies and contract chip manufacturers. Over the last two years combined, Lam stock is up 59%.Coty (COTY)  2018: -67%  2019: +67%  In July,            Coty      announced a turnaround plan intended to “drive substantial improvement” in its consumer beauty business while deleveraging and improving profitability. In November, the company announced a deal to buy a 51% stake in Kylie Jenner’s company Kylie Cosmetics for $600 million. Coty is still down 45% over the last two years. Western Digital (WDC)  2018 -54%  2019 +70%  With the 2015 acquisition of SanDisk,            Western Digital      has become a bet on memory chips—with both DRAM and NAND memories expected to show better pricing and improved demand in 2020 and beyond. The stock is down 22% over the last two years.Applied Materials      (AMAT)  2018 -36%  2019 +87%  Like Lam, Applied is benefiting from anticipation of improving demand for chip making gear. On the company’s most recent earnings conference call, CFO Daniel Durn said that “while it’s always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it’s a matter of when, not if.” Shares are up 19% over the last two years.Arconic (ARNC)  2018 -38%  2019 +85%  The specialty metals company, spun off from            Alcoa      (AA) three years ago, rejected a buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in January. Instead, the company has filed with the SEC to split in two, with one company focused on aerospace and the other on autos—a move investors expect to unlock value for shareholders. Arconic shares are up 14% over the last two years.Xerox Holdings      (XRX):  2018 -32%  2019 +90%  Xerox shares have gotten a boost from the company’s aggressive cost-cutting moves, as well as its decision to sell its long held joint venture in Japan with Fujifilm. In recent weeks, the focus has shifted to the company’s bold unsolicited bid for            HP      (HPQ). Xerox is up 28% over the last two years.Fortune Brands Home & Security      (FBHS)  2018 -44%  2019 +72%  Fortune makes cabinets, plumbing supplies, and other home building wares. While the company said in reporting third-quarter results that the market had been slower than expected, it also said that there was a pickup in demand in September and October from both the new construction and home repair markets. Starting in January, President and COO Nicholas Fink becomes CEO, taking over for Christopher Klein, who is retiring. The stock is down 4% over the last two years.KLA (KLAC)  2018 -15%,  2019 +100%  The semiconductor capital equipment firm is seeing good demand from the logic chip sector, and it sees broad trends driving growth in 2020 and beyond. CEO Rick Wallace said on the company’s latest conference call that “the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence growing semiconductor investment in China, and continued device and process innovation.”            KLA      shares are up 69% over the last two years. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  2018 -29%  2019 +82%  Skyworks makes radio chips for mobile phones, which are expected to see accelerating demand in 2020 with the arrival of the first 5G handsets. The stock is up 27% over the last two years.General Electric      (GE)  2018 -57%  2019 +54%  After a disastrous 2018, GE shares are showing signs of life. Investors seem to have gained confidence that GE has gotten a grip on its operating issues. Bulls expect improvements ahead at GE Power, continued solid performance at GE Healthcare, and growth in aircraft leasing. That said, its aircraft engine business remains vulnerable to the continued troubles with            Boeing’s      737 Max aircraft. GE shares are still down 33% over the last two years.

0,"Arista Networks      shares are trading modestly lower after Barclays analyst Tim Long cut his rating on the networking-hardware company to Equal Weight from Overweight, while lifting his price target on the shares to $220, from $210.The stock closed Wednesday at $235.05. Shares slipped 1.2% to $232.26 on Thursday morning Long’s primary concern is that Arista Networks (ticker: ANET) is losing market share with cloud customers, while new products in other categories are too new to offset market-share losses with key customers, in particular            Facebook      (FB) and            Microsoft      (MSFT). Long says that while the company has more than doubled its share of the data-center switch market over the last five years, “that trend is stalling.”He notes that the company’s share of the market with “cloud titan” customers reached 18% in 2018, up from 5% in 2014, but says that due to issues with Facebook and Microsoft, the total is likely to decline in 2020. He sees Facebook using more “white box” hardware—essentially building its own gear— while Microsoft adds a second source for 400-gigabit switches.Meanwhile, he says that some providers of cloud-based software are moving their services from their own data centers to the large public clouds. He also notes that in data centers and hybrid private/public cloud networks,            Juniper Networks      (JNPR) and            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) have become more competitive. Long cuts his estimates of Arista’s earnings per share to $9.16 a share from $9.50, for 2020, and to $10.06 from $10.48, for 2021.

1,"Heading into the coming December quarter earnings season, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish surveyed 35 “channel partners” on the state of the enterprise technology market. In a research note Wednesday, he writes that his biggest takeaway from the survey is that the picture looks better for software players than for hardware vendors. Fish, who does this exercise on a quarterly basis, found insights in the survey for multiple companies.Fish reports that the survey points to potential earnings upside for virtualization and cloud computing software company            VMware       (ticker: VMW), as well as for            Nutanix      (NTNX) and            Akamai Technologies      (AKAM). Nutanix provides hybrid cloud software, while Akamai is a content delivery network and one of Fishs top infrastructure picks. Fish’s other top infrastructure picks are            Cloudflare      (NET) and            RingCentral      (RNG). He adds that the survey results lead him to be incrementally more bullish on VMware, Zoom Video (ZM) and            Arista      Networks (ANET). The analyst, meanwhile, sees evidence of potential earnings misses at            Juniper      Networks (JNPR)—which makes networking hardware—as well as            NetScout      (NTCT) and            CommVault      (CMVLT). Netscout provides application and network performance management software, and CommVault provides data protection softwareAs a result of the survey, he is more cautious on Juniper and CommVault, along with            LogMeIn      (LOGM).

1,"Ciena      stock jumped after the optical networking company posted mixed results for its fiscal fourth quarter.For the quarter, ended Oct. 31, the company reported revenue of $968 million, up 7.6% from a year earlier, and ahead of the consensus forecast among Wall Street analysts for a result of $964.3 million. Non-GAAP profits of 58 cents a share fell short of the Street consensus view that Ciena would earn 63 cents a share.Ciena repurchased 1 million shares in the quarter for $38.2 million.The company said that one customer in the quarter accounted for 15.1% of revenue; three individual customers each accounted for more than 10% of revenue in the full year, for a combined 34.1%.“Our outstanding Q4 financial performance rounded out an extraordinary year of industry-leading growth and profitability,” CEO Gary Smith said in a statement. “Our innovation, diversification and scale uniquely position us to continue taking share while delivering improved operating margin and driving sustained EPS growth in 2020.”On its earnings conference call Thursday morning, Ciena projected first-quarter revenue of $805 million to $835 million. The midpoint of the range is just below the Street consensus at $823 million. The company sees full-year fiscal 2020 revenue about in line with consensus at $3.79 billion. Ciena continues to target 20% growth in EPS over the next three years.In an interview with Barron’s, Smith noted that Ciena expects its operating margin to reach 15% in fiscal 2020, up from 13.1% in the latest fiscal year, with a three-year target in the 16% to 17% range. The CEO said that while Ciena does see some of the same big-picture issues that have recently affected the results of companies like Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Arista Networks (ANET), he added that it is enjoying strong demand for its own products from datacenter and service providers. The emergence of 5G wireless technology also helps Ciena’s business, Smith said. “5G is mobile until it’s not,” he said, with carriers trying to get higher-speed terrestrial networks closer to customers.Ciena shares were up 14% at $40.42 at 11:12 a.m., while the S&P 500 has gained 0.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had rise 232 points, or 0.8%.

0,"In a strange bit of timing, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller late Tuesday launched coverage of            Cisco Systems      stock, just ahead of the company’s October quarter earnings report due after the close of trading Wednesday afternoon.The Outperform rating for Cisco shares (ticker: CSCO) was part of Muller’s broader coverage launch on six hardware companies. He also set Outperform ratings on            Apple      (AAPL) and the audio hardware company            Sonos      (SONO). He launches with Sector Perform ratings on networking plays            Arista Networks      (ANET) and            Juniper Networks      (JNPR), as well as the contract manufacturer Jabil (JBL).Muller says the broader hardware category should benefit from multiple emerging trends, including Wi-Fi 6, 400G switching, 5G cellular, cloud, Internet of Things, smart devices, connected homes, and streaming video. Wi-Fi 6 is the next, faster generation of Wi-Fi, while 400G refers to networks carrying data at 400 billion bits per second.“Companies with expertise in designing, manufacturing, and/or selling the hardware and applicable software should be able to capitalize on these secular trends,” he writes, “but timing and volatility regarding the realization of these benefits is top of mind.”In the networking sector in particular, Muller says there are questions about cloud networking budgets for 2020, the timing of 400G switching, and the tone of telecommunications spending, leaving him to take a “cautious approach.” The analyst says Cisco is best positioned for the near term, with positive prospects long-term as well. “We expect Arista to win the 400G cycle but believe its near-term upside may be limited following its recent 2020 cloud outlook; however we believe that Arista will become more compelling as we approach the 2020 second half,” he writes. Juniper, meanwhile, is “a ‘show me’ story for the time being.”Here are brief comments from Muller on all six of the companies he now covers:Juniper and Arista were down slightly on Wednesday; the other four stocks are fractionally higher.

0,"Cisco Systems      will report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Investors are nervous on two fronts.First, there are worries about softening demand from large cloud- services providers, sparked by comments from Cisco rival            Arista Networks      (ticker: ANET). Arista shares swooned after the company recently said it had experienced a sudden softening of demand from one “cloud titan” customer, believed to be            Facebook      (FB). And second, there are fears that telecommunications and cable companies are trimming capital spending because of concern over weakness in the broader economy.Cisco (CSCO) remains the unquestioned leader in networking, but the business has matured. The company’s days of double-digit growth are long past. For its fiscal first quarter, ended Oct. 31, Cisco has forecast revenue growth of 0% to 2%, with earnings of 64 to 69 cents a share under generally accepted accounting principles, or 80 to 82 cents on a non-GAAP basis. The consensus on Wall Street is that revenue will be $13.08 billion, flat with a year ago, and non-GAAP profits will come in at 81 cents a share.The results are due on Wednesday afternoon.In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company posted revenue of $13.4 billion and non-GAAP profits of 83 cents a share, Wall Street expects revenue of $12.76 billion and non-GAAP profits of 76 cents a share for the fiscal second quarter.Cisco shares are up about 14% this year—they closed Monday at $48.10, down 1.5% on the day—but the gain largely came in the early part of the year. The stock is off about 17% since it peaked above $58 in July, amid concerns about weakening spending by both public cloud-services providers and carriers. Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a research note that he isn’t expecting any meaningful upside in either the first-quarter results or the outlook for the second quarter, but he said that fears of an Arista-style meltdown are unwarranted. “Cisco’s diversified customer base provides a significant offset to issues with any one client; no customer accounts for more than 10% of sales,” he wrote. “In addition, while we expect cloud customer spend to remain volatile, we do not expect a widespread halt in cloud spend near term.”Suva noted that cloud sales account for less than 30% of Cisco’s revenue, and that expectations for cloud-related capital spending have generally been revised lower. He also said third-quarter results from telco and cable companies suggest that their capital spending is under pressure and that their spending forecasts are gradually declining. Still, he maintained his Buy rating and $57 price target on the shares. J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chaterjee has an Overweight rating and $62 price target on Cisco shares. Still, he cautioned that recent data points on enterprise IT spending have been “mixed,” including soft outlooks from both rival            Juniper Networks      (JNPR) and Cisco supplier            Marvell Technology Group      (MRVL). “We do not rule out a conservative guide once again largely given limited confidence in resilient spending trends for the next three months if concerns relative to global growth persists,” he wrote.On Monday, Piper Jaffray analyst James Fishcut his rating on Cisco shares to Neutral from Overweight, with a new price target of $51, down from $55. “Our downgrade centers on a slowing macro-environment across Enterprise and Service Provider,” he wrote, saying that he sees the “downside as fairly limited from here.” Nomura Instinet’s Jeffrey Kvaal said in his quarterly preview note that he thinks expectations for the current quarter are too high, given a weakening economy, weak service provider spending “and possible challenges at smaller cloud players.” Kvaal maintained a Neutral rating and $47 price target.

0,"Intel      (ticker: INTC) is on hot streak with its strong earnings reports over the last two quarters. But the chip maker is facing increasing competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and            Taiwan Semiconductor      Manufacturing (TSM). Still, the company’s chief financial officer believes Intel is well-positioned to meet the new challenges, giving the chip maker a bright future.In late October, Intel reported September-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. The company reported adjusted third-quarter earnings per share of $1.42, versus the $1.23 Wall Street consensus. Revenue of $19.2 billion beat expectations of $18.1 billion. Moreover, the chip maker’s 2019 guidance was above Wall Street’s expectations for the full year.At the time, Intel also said that demand from its cloud-computing customers improved. Sales from its cloud-computing segment were up 3% year over year for the September quarter versus a 1% drop in the prior quarter. Last Friday, George Davis, who was appointed as Intel’s chief financial officer in April, stopped by Barron’s offices and made the case for the company’s exciting future. Here’s an edited transcript from our interview with the Intel executive. Barron’s: Intel’s cloud-computing business improved in the September quarter. But since the report, we’ve had a couple of soft cloud-related data points—including            Arista Networks      ’ poor guidance and            Facebook’s      lower-than-expected capital expenditure forecasts. Did these announcements surprise you at all? Davis: I can’t really comment on any one particular customer and the specific demand there. Facebook (FB) can say whatever they want. It doesn’t change our view of what we see as the outlook for the next quarter. We’re in pretty close contact with the entire ecosystem. We try and reflect the best estimate out of the discussions that we’re directly having with the customers. Intel’s gross margin is down significantly year-over-year. Where do you see future gross profit margins going with the new manufacturing node cadence of every 2 to 2.5 years? Intel has stated it intends to move to next generation chip manufacturing technologies at a quicker pace We’re still keenly focused on gross margin. Everything from capital efficiency to the way we’re designing our products. What we’ve said though, the delay in 10 nanometer means that we’re going to be a little bit disadvantaged on unit cost for a period of time. We actually gave guidance for gross margin out in 2021 to help people understand. 2023 is the period that we were ultimately guiding when we’re going to see very strong revenue growth and margin expansion. We’ve got to get through this period where we have the 10 nanometer being a little bit late as we’re not optimized on a node that we’re on. But by then we’re moving to a two to two and a half year cadence on the next nodes. So we’re pulling in the spending on 7 nanometer, which will start up in the second half of 2021 because we think it’s the right thing to do competitively. So we’re making the investment now that makes us just a little less efficient, and that’s reflected in gross margin. My industry contacts are saying AMD’s (AMD) new Rome server chips are getting good traction with customers. Can you comment on the competitive landscape over the next couple of years against AMD’s chip lineup and Taiwan Semiconductor’s chip manufacturing technology? We said we expect to have heightened competition over the next 18 to 24 months. And our outlook reflects that. Our view on the nature of that competition and impact hasn’t really changed since we gave our longer term forecast in May.  What are you most excited about in terms of future technologies over the next few years for Intel? What are the big tech trends? I’m really excited about AI in particular. The evolution of AI is going to reflect all of the use cases that are going to come out of this movement to 5G and the amount of information that is going to go from device to device.Let me give you example. Mobileye Intel acquired Mobileye in 2017. It makes vision-based advanced driver-assistance chips and systems is both about great hardware technology, but also extraordinary software. We’re investing heavily, and it’s getting adopted so rapidly, that it’s actually an attractive return in the near term and very attractive in the long term. If you look at the design wins in level two and level three autonomous driving, Mobileye is leading across the world. What about AI? One of the competitive advantages that Intel has is the way that AI has been embedded into the Xeon processor. When you take into account the capabilities that we’ve added there, you can get up to 9X capability than the competition can get because it’s been optimized, and we’ve been going at it for a very long time. AI is very early in its development. We have more than one bet, so we’re looking at it from a number of different angles. Having the ability to look across the portfolio solutions will be very valuable to our customers. Thanks for your time George.

0,"Arista Networks      (ANET) shares are falling hard in late trading Thursday, after the networking equipment company provided the Street with a nasty Halloween scare: Fourth-quarter guidance dramatically missed Street estimates, as business with a single customer—but not Microsoft (MSFT)—suddenly fell off a cliff.For the third quarter, Arista posted revenue of $654.4 million, up 16.2% from a year ago, and a bit ahead of the Street at $653.3 million. Non-GAAP profits for the quarter were $2.69 a share, ahead of the Street at $2.41 a share.But Arista’s Q4 guidance came in dramatically shy of expectations: The company is projecting revenue of $540 million to $560 million, far below the Street consensus at $686.2 million.CEO Jayshree Ullal said in a statement that the company expects “a sudden softening in Q4 with a specific cloud titan customer.” At the midpoint, revenue guidance will miss consensus by close to 20%.Although Arista did not specify the customer, a spokesman said in response to a query from Barron’s that “it is not Microsoft and we have not disclosed who the customer is.” In its 2018 10K filing, Arista said: “Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers. Due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. For example, our sales to Microsoft as an end-user in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, representing 27% of our revenue during fiscal 2018, benefited from certain factors that may not repeat in fiscal 2019 or future fiscal years and the percentage of our revenue from Microsoft in fiscal 2019 may decline.”Arista shares in late trading are down almost 20%, to $199.10. Shares of Arista’s primary rival,            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), are down about 1.5%.(A previous version of this story incorrectly speculated that Microsoft was the customer involved in the projected December quarter shortfall.)

1,"Microsoft      cemented its status as a haven from the recent selloff in software stocks with its latest quarterly results—but it didn’t help shares of data-networking companies. The software giant reported capital spending that was slightly lower than expected late Wednesday. And while the headline expenditure figure rose 12% from last year, Microsoft’s cash capital outlay was down 6% from last year, according to Raymond James. (The latter figure excludes spending on leases.)That contributed to a selloff in            Arista Networks      (ANET),            Commscope Holding      (COMM) and            Ciena      (CIEN). All three companies’ stocks were down at least 2% in afternoon trading Thursday, while the        S&P 500      was up slightly. Third-quarter results from            Nokia      (NOK), the equipment maker and networking company, dealt a bigger blow to the stocks, analysts said. Nokia’s American depository receipts fell nearly 25% in U.S. trading after it announced that the transition to 5G has been more cash-intensive than previously expected. Nokia cut forecasts for its 2019 and 2020 profits, and halted its dividend payments so it can invest in its 5G business.Microsoft fared considerably better. Its shares rallied 2% after it beat Wall Street’s forecasts on several different fronts. It also said capital spending is expected to decline this quarter from last quarter, though it attributed the decline to “normal variability in infrastructure spend timing.”“Nokia’s issues appear to be company specific, but it’s another data point that will increase caution around 5G,” wrote analysts at Evercore ISI in a note to clients. “We do not think investors should read too much into quarterly fluctuations in capex.” Write to Alexandra Scaggs at alexandra.scaggs@barrons.com Microsoft cemented its status as a haven from the recent selloff in software stocks with its latest quarterly results—but it didn’t help shares of data-networking companies.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedWe’d like to think that when a stock is up almost 2% after reporting earnings, like Microsoft is, that the numbers were unequivocally good. In this case, maybe not. It wasn’t that there was anything funny buried in Microsoft’s numbers. It reported a profit of $1.38 a share on sales of $33.1 billion, both better than expected. But            Microsoft      (MSFT) also spent less than predicted, which could be bad news for cloud companies like            Arista Networks      (ANET) and            Ciena      (CIEN). At least that’s the case made by Evercore’s Amit Daryanani. Of course, the biggest problem for those companies, as well as            CommScope Holding      (COMM) might be            Nokia’s      disastrous quarter and full year guidance (it also eliminated its dividend). But Microsoft’s lighter capital spending is also feeding the worry, Daryanani writes. “Networking names selling off today with ANET, COMM, & CIEN down 3%+ on the back of disappointing NOK print (not covered) and modestly lower capex from MSFT,” he explained. “MSFT attributed the lower than expected capex to normal quarterly variability, but the lower headline number should contribute to the bearish narrative for cloud leaders ANET & CIEN.”Daryanani, however, doesn’t think it’s time to panic. “MSFT cloud revenue growth remains robust and we do not think investors should read too much into q/q fluctuations in capex,” he writes.Microsoft stock has risen 2% to $140.01, while Arista Networks has fallen 3% to $239.15, Ciena has declined $36.80, and CommScope Holding has dropped 5.7% to $12.30.

1,"Arista Networks      shares are trading lower Thursday after Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal cut his rating on the network equipment provider to Neutral from Buy, while chopping his price target on the shares to $230 from $290. In a research note, Kvaal cautions that a recovery in the company’s business with public cloud customers could be “protracted”—and that Arista (ticker: ANET) could lose market share to rival switch-makers in the second half of 2020.Kvaal chopped his profit forecast for 2020 to $10.12 a share, from $10.48, which already was below consensus at $10.53. Arista has said the new normal growth rate for its “webscale” segment—a reference to large public cloud players like            Alphabet’s      (GOOGL) Google,            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and            Microsoft      (MSFT)—is in the low single digits, the analyst wrote in a research note. He adds that demand for switches in the second half of next year could be muted, “as rival switches are now sufficient to serve as a second source.” Kvaal points in particular to potential market share losses to            Juniper Networks      (JNPR) at Microsoft, a factor he fears will offset improved spending growth in the sector and “weigh on Arista’s multiple.”Kvaal asserts that “Arista’s forward P/E multiple is only starting to reflect decelerating revenue growth.” He notes that the stock’s price/earnings multiple has declined from over 40 in early 2018 to 20-25 lately. Kvall reports that Arista’s average multiple since its IPO has been 30, but notes that he doesn’t see Arista returning to the 30%-plus revenue growth exhibited during its first years following its IPO. “The last time ANET shares traded between 20x and 25x forward earnings was in 2016, when the company was still posting 30-40% YoY growth,” he writes. “We believe a low-20x multiple is more appropriate for this long-term mid-teens grower.”Arista is down 3.2%, at $221.06, in Thursday trading.

1,"Autodesk      shares were down in late trading Thursday on weaker-than-expected guidance for the design software company’s April quarter. For the fiscal fourth quarter ended in January, the company reported revenue of $899 million, ahead of Wall Street analysts’ consensus forecast of $890 million, with non-GAAP earnings of 92 cents a share, ahead of the Street at 89 cents.Revenues were up 23% in the U.S., 21% in EMEA and 26% in Asia Pacific.For the fiscal first quarter ending in April, Autodesk (ticker: ADSK) projects revenue of $880 million to $895 million, and non-GAAP profits of 80 to 86 cents a share, below the previous Street consensus at $910 million and 88 cents a share.For the full year ending January 2021, Autodesk projects revenue of $3.93 billion to $3.99 billion, with non-GAAP profits of $4.21 to $4.44 a share. Previous consensus estimates called for $3.98 billion in revenue and profits of $4.41 a share.“We ended fiscal 2020 on a very strong note with revenue, earnings, and free cash flow coming in above expectations. We are entering the sustainable growth phase of our subscription journey with great momentum,” Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost said in a statement. “Our construction business had a landmark year, we continue to gain share in manufacturing, and are making steady progress in monetizing non-compliant users.

He also notes that the company has very modest exposure to the China market, at less than 3% of revenue. He also points out that most of Autodesk’s business is through local resellers, which means the company is not directly affected by travel bans and restrictions in the same way as other software companies that rely more heavily on their own salespeople. For now, he emphasized, the coronavirus isn’t much of an issue for Autodesk.

1,"It might be time for            Microsoft      to go shopping. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin asserts in a research note Thursday that 2020 could be a defining year for the software giant. He argues that Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) has “a unique opportunity to further elevate its cloud leadership position through share gains and needle-moving M&A.” The company’s huge run to a $1 trillion-plus valuation has been driven by the remarkable growth in its Azure cloud business, which is smaller than            Amazon.com’s      (AMZN) Amazon Web Services but growing faster—and Bracelin thinks the company can press its advantage with a smart deals. Read Next: The Dow Could Hit 30,000 Five Years Ahead of Schedule. It Won’t Stop There. Bracelin today repeated his Buy rating on Microsoft shares, lifting his target price to $190 from $158. The Piper analyst writes that with $67 billion in net cash and another $200 billion of projected future free cash flow over the next three years, “M&A could take center stage in 2020.” He notes that Microsoft has less than 5% market share in business application software, giving the company “many options” to boost its position in the enterprise beyond Azure, LinkedIn, Office 365, and GitHub.Bracelin points out that Microsoft has grown 8.5% on average over the past decade, but contends that the company is poised to see growth accelerate to a 12% annual rate over the next three years, driven by its cloud business. He notes that the company’s commercial cloud business has grown to 35% of revenue from 14% years three years ago, and that the total should top 50% by fiscal 2023, as the company’s cloud revenues eclipse $100 billion.He sees multiple drivers for potential upside performance by Microsoft this year, including cloud momentum, further expansion in the security software market, and the debut of the first new Xbox console in seven years. There are some offsets, though, he cautions—including the continuing shortage of            Intel      (INTC) microprocessors, which could affect Windows revenue, and the conclusion of the recent Windows upgrade cycle, with the termination of support for Windows 7.So what might Microsoft buy? “After applying Microsoft’s acquisition philosophy and framework across the business application software universe, we have identified potential acquisition targets that we would deem to be needle-moving pursuits,” Bracelin writes. With the caveat that there is zero evidence that any of these proposed deals are actually in the works—nor is anyone asserting they are—here’s his list of 10 potential targets:Microsoft stock is up 0.2%, at $166.01, in recent trading.

1,"Autodesk      (ADSK) makes software that helps people design things—buildings, cars, gadgets, factories. To state the obvious, when the economy slows, people buy less stuff. And people who make things logically slow their purchases of software to make new stuff.And that’s why Autodesk shares are getting crushed today. On Tuesday afternoon, the company announced earnings for its fiscal second quarter ended in July that were perfectly fine, but then Autodesk reduced its full year guidance, gently cautioning that slowing demand could reduce its growth in the back half of the year. More or less the entire Autodesk analyst posse cut their price targets on the company on Wednesday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan went one step further, cutting his rating on the stock to Underperform from Neutral and chopping his target to $127 from $170, pointing to weakness in both manufacturing and construction in a few key markets, including the U.K., Germany, and China. At least 11 other analysts cut their target prices on the stock Canaccord analyst Richard Davis kept a Buy rating on the stock while cutting his target to $160 from $190. “Our commentary on ADSK remains the same as it has been for the past few months,” he writes. “If you do not expect a recession in 2020, this stock is too cheap on most metrics ...We do not expect a recession in 2020, we expect ADSK to rally, perhaps a lot for the next few months, but we are worried about a recession in 2021, so it is possible that ADSK is a shorter-term buy than a longer-term one.” Citigroup’s Tyler Radke likewise kept a Buy rating, but he remains cautious. “Autodesk is not immune to the impact of a weaker macro environment,” he writes in a post-earnings research note. “While we continue to see more resiliency under a subscription model, a meaningful downturn would have a negative impact to our estimates and long-term targets.” He trimmed his target price to $186 from $210. J.P. Morgan’s Sterling Auty confirms that “results in the quarter were great with beats from top to bottom,” but that “management is seeing signs of macro concern” in the UK, EMEA, and China. “So to be proactive, they are cutting guidance a modest amount, but not taking meaningful steps that would indicate any concerns lingering from the macro perspective. We like the initial cut, but remain concerned about the potential of further macro impacts in the back half of the year.” He repeated a Neutral rating, while trimming his target to $160 from $165.ADSK stock was recently down $12.21, or 8.1%, to $138.00.

0,"Autodesk       (ticker: ADSK) shares were tumbling after hours Tuesday after the leader in computer-aided-design software reduced its full year outlook, hinting that the company’s broad exposure to the construction and manufacturing segments of the economy could pose risks to financial performance in the months ahead. For the fiscal second quarter ended July 31, Autodesk posted revenue of $796.8 million, up 30% from a year earlier and ahead of the Street consensus at $787 million. Non-GAAP profit of 65 cents a share likewise beat consensus at 61 cents.That was all fine—but the outlook is pressuring Autodesk shares. For the fiscal third quarter, guidance missed. Autodesk is projecting revenue of $820 million to $830 million, with non-GAAP profit of 70 cents to 74 cents a share, shy of the previous consensus at $838.8 million and 77 cents. For the full year ending January 2020, the company now sees revenue of $3.24 billion to $3.27 billion, down from a previous range of $3.25 billion to $3.3 billion. And Autodesk cut its full-year non-GAAP profit forecast to a range of $2.69 to $2.81 a share, from $2.71 to $2.90.Autodesk also said its full-year growth in “annualized recurring revenue,” an important measure for a company delivering software on a subscription basis, is likely to be up 25% to 27%; previous guidance was for growth of 27% to 29%. And it trimmed its free cash flow outlook for the full year to $1.3 billion from $1.35 billion.“While we continue to execute well and are not materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro uncertainty, we are taking a prudent stance to our second half fiscal 2020 outlook,” Autodesk CFO Scott Herren said in a statement, managing to say everything was fine while simultaneously sounding conservative. CEO Andrew Anagnost added that “in an environment of increasing uncertainty,” the company is “well-positioned” to achieve its long-term goals.Autodesk’s standard news release boilerplate says the company “makes software for people who make things.” In a softening economy, people who make things might not buy as much software from companies like Autodesk.

1,"If you’re an office worker, you’re increasingly likely to have heard of            Slack Technologies      —or to use its tools yourself. Starting Thursday, you’ll be able to invest in it, too. The Slack public listing will add another name to the growing list of high-profile companies to start trading in 2019. Its listing will surely attract scrutiny, largely because of its unusual method of going public—the “direct listing” means no new shares are being offered—but also because of the attention, both positive and negative, to recent tech IPOs. (Not to mention, we should note, those that sell fake meat.)Have questions about Slack’s offering? Barron’s has answers. Read on. “I’ll Slack you” has, for many, become a modern ”I’ll Xerox it,” and an explanatory video the company posted on YouTube is titled “You’ve Probably Heard of Slack.” (Perhaps remarkably, its lead character works at a newspaper.) Read our recent feature: Slack Is Going Public as It Tries to Kill Email. The Stock Won’t Be Cheap.Slack makes and sells what’s known as workforce collaboration software, which in effect means digital tools for workplace chatter, group conversations, presentations, file sharing, and other activities. Think            Apple’s      iMessage, combined with email and some elements of            Microsoft      Office.The company says it has more than 10 million users across hundreds of thousands of organizations, large and small, in over 150 countries.Not exactly. Slack plans a “direct public listing,” which you may have heard of when streaming music company            Spotify Technology      (SPOT) did it last year. The principal difference between public listings and IPOs: A direct public listing lets investors trade in a company’s stock but the company doesn’t issue new shares, so it doesn’t raise any money for itself. Anyone who currently owns shares can sell, though they don’t have to. Slack has said it expects to start trading on Thursday, June 20. Slack plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol WORK. (It had previously said it would use SK.)We don’t know, yet. The New York Stock Exchange said late Wednesday that it had established a “reference price” of $26 per share. But there are no assurances the reference price will reflect early trading in Slack stock. In the only other recent example of a direct listing, the NYSE set a reference price on Spotify stock of $132. That was about in line with the highest previous private market transaction in Spotify shares at $131.88. In Spotify’s case, the stock opened 25.6% above the reference price, at $165.90, and then closed the first day of trading at $149.01. Slack’s reference price is below its previous high private market trade of $31.50. With about 600 million shares outstanding, the reference price would give Slack a market value of $15.6 billion, or about 26 times the midpoint of the company’s revenue guidance for the current fiscal year of $590 million to $600 million.Last year, Slack announced a round of private financing valuing the company at $7.1 billion, or just under $12 per share. In any case, in direct listings there’s no “IPO price” set by bankers—and no rules limiting the initial supply of shares. Because there’s no official price set by IPO bankers, Slack shares could be volatile in their early hours, days and even weeks of trading. And it could be hours after the open before trading actually starts Thursday.Companies with more of a consumer focus have seen their offerings come under pressure. Both            Lyft      (LYFT) and            Uber Technologies      (UBER) are currently trading below their opening prices.Investors have been more upbeat about companies that serve corporate clients. Zoom Video Communications (ZM), a videoconferencing services company, started strong and has kept rising. And digital operations management software company            PagerDuty      (PD) has generally risen since it started trading.  Read more: The IPO Market Is Heating UpWhile Slack’s product is reasonably well-known, Slack would probably prefer to be seen mainly as an enterprise software businesses.At the end of its latest fiscal year, ended Jan. 31, the company said it had more than 10 million daily active users. More than 600,000 organizations had at least three users, according to Slack. (More than 1 billion messages were sent in the last seven days of January, according to Slack.)  In the quarter ended April 30, the company reported more than 95,000 paid customers, including 645 who accounted for more than $100,000 in recurring annual revenue.  In a filing, Slack said its customers include companies ranging from            Autodesk      (ADSK) to Liberty Mutual, as well as NASA. No one paid customer represented more than 3% of revenue through the last three full fiscal years, the company said. (The Barron’s newsroom uses Slack all day long.) Read more: Why the IPO Market Has Been So Bizarre This YearSlack says its “primary” competitor is            Microsoft,      which owns Skype and sells its Office suite to businesses. But Slack also lists            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), and            Facebook      (FB) as competitors, albeit in different ways. A number of companies with which it partners, meanwhile, could eventually add competing services, according to a company filing, which named            Oracle      (ORCL),            Salesforce      (CRM),            Workday (WDAY),      and the aforementioned Zoom among them.Slack is not yet profitable. On June 10, the company forecast a full-year adjusted loss of $182 million to $192 million, including $34 million in one-time expenses related to its direct listing. “We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future,” the company previously said in a filing.It is. First-quarter revenue rose 67% year-over-year to $134.8 million, the company said. Some potential investors, however, may worry about slowing growth. Slack says to expect full-year revenue growth of 47% to 50%, which would put it somewhere near $600 million.

0,"Activist investor Bill Ackman is enjoying a modest revival this year after three terrible years of investment performance. Now, his closed-end fund has picked up a recommendation from one of the few analysts covering it. Jefferies analyst Matthew Hose on Friday upgraded            Pershing Square Holdings      to Buy from Hold, citing its wide discount to net asset value, better performance and actions to narrow the discount. The fund trades on Euronext Amsterdam (ticker: PSH.Netherlands),The shares, now around $14.50, trade for a roughly 24% discount to the fund’s net asset value of $19.13 a share on Oct. 16. The fund reports its NAV weekly. The $3.2 billion (market value) fund also trades lightly on the Pinks Sheets under the ticker PSHZF. The fund is leveraged with $1 billion of debt. “We view PSH’s current discount to NAV as unsustainable,’ Hose wrote to clients. “Sentiment towards the fund needs to catch up with the recent recovery in NAV performance, or further action aimed at addressing the discount will be required. Either way, shareholders should be rewarded.” The fund’s net asset value was up 9.9% through Oct. 16, ahead of the 6.7% total return of the S&P 500. That followed a poor stretch from 2015 to 2017 when the fund’s NAV fell 34%, against a 38.3% total return for the S&P 500, Hose wrote. Ackman was hurt by a big loss suffered in            Bausch Health Cos      (BSC), formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, and a short bet against            Herbalife Nutrition      (HLF). The fund carries similar investments to Ackman’s hedge fund run by his Pershing Square Capital Management. The big discount on the fund appears to reflect lingering negative sentiment from Ackman’s weak performance from 2015 through 2017 and growing investor disenchantment with hedge funds, many of which have lagged the overall market in recent years. Activist investor Dan Loeb’s overseas closed-end fund Third Point Offshore Investors (TPOU.LN) traded at a 22% discount to its net asset value at the end of September. Loeb’s fund, which is equivalent to Loeb’s main hedge fund, finished trading Friday at $14.70. Ackman’s Pershing Square hedge fund and other private funds have seen persistent investor redemptions that Hose estimated totaled more than $1 billion in the first half of 2018. Pershing Square had no comment. Barron’s wrote favorably on the Ackman fund earlier this year (“So You Really Want to Bet on Bill Ackman?”) when the fund traded around $12.60.Ackman’s fund is concentrated with 10 holdings at the end of September. Its largest holdings are Restaurant Brands (QSR),            Automatic Data Processing      (ADP)            Chipotle Mexican Grill      (CMG), and            Lowe’s Cos.      (LOW), according to Hose. Ackman recently said at a conference sponsored by Grant’s Interest Rate Observer that his firm had taken a new position of 15.2 million shares in            Starbucks      (SBUX), now worth nearly $900 million. Hose wrote that the fund ought to be trading at a narrower discount to NAV since its holdings can be hedged pretty easily, which should facilitate arbitrage. The fund has taken steps to narrow the discount, including a $300 million Dutch auction tender earlier this year. Ackman has purchased 25.4 million shares of the fund as well. Hose thinks the discount should be narrower than 10%.“PSH has arguably ‘thrown the kitchen sink’ at its discount; however, further action may still be required,” Hose wrote. This is a more acute issue for Ackman since he has often put pressure on target companies to effectively narrow the discounts at which their stock trade to intrinsic value, Hose noted. The fund’s base fees aren’t cheap at 1.5% annually (reduced to about 1.3% in 2018 and 2019) and it has an incentive fee of 16%. But that incentive fee won’t be paid until the fund hits its high water mark – which is about 40% above the recent net asset value. The closed-end fund accounted for over half of the Pershing Square’s $8.4 billion of assets under management on Sept. 30, up from about a third at the time of the fund’s IPO in 2014. This reflects the ongoing redemptions at the Ackman hedge fund. Ackman has vowed to refocus his attention on investments and spend less time on investor relations. With a portfolio of high-quality stocks trading at big discount to its portfolio value, the fund offers a nice way to play a continued recovery in Ackman’s fortunes.

0,"“Coronavirus” isn’t the only term that Americans are typing into their Google search boxes these days. “Unemployment” and “recession” are trending, too. In the first 20 days of March,            Alphabet’s      Google searches for “unemployment” far exceeded their volume for all of July 2010, when the U.S. jobless rate ran at 9.5%. And Google Trends data on “recession” was almost double what it was in any month during the financial crisis’s peak fall 2008-spring 2009 period.These trending searches anticipated awful economic data. Last week’s U.S. unemployment-insurance claims hit a record high of 3.28 million, up from 220,000 two weeks earlier. Some economists forecast as much as a 30% drop in second-quarter gross domestic product. Meanwhile, locked-down Americans are changing how they work and play. Searches for “work from home” tripled from December to March, to their highest level ever. Searches for “videoconferencing” also spiked in recent weeks, as more companies told employees to work from home to limit Covid-19’s spread. In fact, as the rest of the stock market sold off, shares of companies such as            Zoom Video Communications      and            Slack Technologies      have soared. And Google searches for delivery services also have surged, along with shares of            Amazon.com, online pet store            Chewy, and other retailers with delivery capabilities. Of course, lots of companies are losing out in the pandemic. Google searches in the U.S. for “cancel flight” and “cancel cruise” soared in early March to more than 20 times their volume a month earlier, just as the airline stocks plunged 50% or more and cruise lines sank 75% for the year. “Bailout” anyone?

0,"There is likely more pain ahead for the semiconductor sector, but Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon says investors should get ready to buy some names on the dip.Chip stocks have tumbled this past week, along with equity markets, as the coronavirus spreads outside of China. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, has declined by about 10% this week, compared with the 9% drop for the S&P 500. “Worries over COVID-19 have recently pressured semis … as of now most semi companies have not baked in much, if any, virus downside,” Rasgon wrote in a note Thursday. “Given this, investors should likely be girding for semiconductor revisions in the near future as they may need to join the supply chain in lowering numbers.”The analyst noted China represents about 35% of sales for the chip industry, adding the smartphone, PC and auto markets are exposed to virus risk both on the supply and demand sides. But Rasgon thinks the business weakness for semiconductors won’t last.“Presumably the situation (however long it lasts) will prove ultimately temporary,” he wrote. “Overall demand levels won’t (in the long term) be permanently impaired. Hence we could see downside (eventually) provide selective buying opportunities.”Rasgon said he has Outperform ratings on            Broadcom      (AVGO),            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI), and            Nvidia      (NVDA). He said Broadcom and NXP are inexpensive even if the two companies lower their financial forecasts. Nvidia is attractive because it is likely to launch a slate of new products this year, he added.

1,"Multiple chip stocks are heading lower Tuesday in the wake of            Apple’s      announcement that its March-quarter revenue will fall short of previous guidance due to the impact of the spreading coronavirus crisis on both contract manufacturing and retail sales in China.Apple (ticker: AAPL) had previously forecast March-quarter revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion but now says it won’t reach that level, and Wall Street estimates are dropping to the $60 billion level or lower. Barclays      analyst Blayne Curtis published a list of component makers Tuesday morning by their revenue exposure to Apple—and most of the names on the list are heading lower. Note, though, that the losses are modest, a reflection of the relatively muted reaction to the announcement on Apple shares. Analysts are cutting their estimates on Apple’s March-quarter results but lifting projections for the June quarter. The widespread view is that the long-term impact on Apple’s business will be minimal.On the other hand, for companies who makes parts for mobile phones, exposure goes beyond Apple and includes both China-based phone makers like Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi and other Android handset makers who rely on Chinese contract manufacturers.Here’s the Barclays list of chip stocks ranked by estimated revenue exposure to Apple:Curtis also ranks chip companies by exposure to Huawei, the leading Chinese mobile-phone manufacturer, and by exposure to non-Huawei Android phone makers like            Samsung Electronics      (005930.Korea):Huawei exposure:Non-Huawei Android phone exposure:In early trading Tuesday, shares of Apple, Micron, Cirrus, Qorvo, Lumentum, and Skyworks were all off more than 2%.

1,"The stock market’s reaction to Coronavirus has been mixed, with some companies that rely on China for customers or supplies falling by double-digits while others have barely shrugged.The virus is likely to reduce economic growth in the first quarter by 2 percentage points globally and 0.4-0.5 points in the U.S., according to            Goldman Sachs      strategists. But Goldman predicts that nearly all of that economic activity will be made up in the second and third quarters, so that there’s barely any net economic impact from the disease. For the full year, U.S. GDP could take a 0.1 to 0.2 point hit, reducing cumulative corporate earnings per share for        S&P 500       companies by 30 to 60 cents. Given that Goldman expects S&P earnings to hit $174 this year, 60 cents is basically chump change.So far, the virus has mostly been contained in China, with nearly 99% of the known cases being recorded there. There’s no guarantee that it won’t begin to spread more aggressively outside the country. For now, investors have mostly treated it like an isolated issue. In China, the death toll hit 910 on Monday morning, surpassing the SARS epidemic. But some analysts see signs that the economy could begin to rebound in February. In fact, some factories that had been shut down could get back to work this week, according to analyst Edward Moya at currency broker OANDA.“Foxconn got approval to resume production in Zhengzhou, the main production point for iPhone 11, with most of the other manufacturing giants all to be poised to back to work within the next couple of weeks,” Moya wrote in a report on Monday. “GM will resume Chinese production on February 15th,            Hyundai Motor      will resume their domestic production tomorrow, both            Sony       &             LG Display       resumed normal operations today, while            Tencent       asked workers to stay at home until February 21st.”That said, businesses had previously predicted they’d restart operations after the Lunar New Year only to be delayed, so these dates could always be pushed back.The Goldman strategists have identified stocks with outsize exposure to China that have fallen the most since investors started to worry about the outbreak. They include            Wynn Resorts      (ticker: WYNN), which makes most of its money in Macau, a gambling resort area in China.            Yum China      (YUMC), which operates KFC and Pizza Hut inside China, has also been hurt. And computer chip maker            Qorvo      (QRVO) makes nearly three quarters of its revenue in China.Other consumer stocks focused on growing sales in China have also been hurt. Both            Royal Caribbean      (RCL) and            Carnival       (CCL) cruise companies are down about 10% since late January.            Starbucks      (SBUX) has closed more than half of its stores in China. Airlines including            Delta       (DAL),            United Airlines      (UAL) and            American Airlines      (AAL) have canceled flights to and from the country. Of those, United has the most exposure to China. Its stock is down 10% this year.Still, the strategists don’t think investors should buy every stock that’s fallen in the hope that the virus will be contained. People should look in particular at cyclical and value stocks, they say. Companies that are growing their dividends have been trailing the market and could rebound on expectations that virus-related declines could reverse. Stocks with growing dividends that are likely to swing on market shifts include            Skyworks       (SWKS),            DXC Technology       (DXC),            Wynn Resorts       (WYNN),            Broadcom      (AVGO), and            Caterpillar      (CAT).

1," 12:36 p.m. Advanced Micro Devices is climbing Monday, and could end the day at an all-time high—despite the risks posed by coronavirus. AMD (ticker: AMD) has jumped 4.5% to $51.99, though there is little news that would seem to be moving the stock. In fact, the only piece is see is an unconfirmed report on Benzinga that its chips could replace            Intel’s      in            Apple’s      (AAPL) iPhone. Intel stock is down 0.4% to $65.74.AMD isn’t the only stock showing strength Monday.            Nvidia      (NVDA) has risen 3.1% to $259.34, while            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) has advanced 1.3% to $114.92.            Broadcom      (AVGO), though, is off 0.9% at $312.25.What about coronavirus? Well, it seems that the market just isnt that worried. Yes, Apple is down after a report raised concerns about the impact of delays at Foxconn on iPhone sales, but just 0.1% to $319.60. So not much worry. And for now, there doesn’t seem to be much worry emanating from the chip makers themselves. “While several chip companies have noted that the coronavirus outbreak creates risk, there has not been any major semiconductor company so far, to our knowledge, that has confirmed any major impact to its business as yet. Memory spot prices appear to be holding fairly steady,” writes Nomura analyst David Wong. “Nevertheless, we continue to think that coronavirus might pose a risk to semiconductor sales in 2020.”Just not yet.

All Rights ReservedU.S. stocks are set to open flat on Monday as investors digest the ongoing threat of the coronavirus. All the benchmark indexes closed at records last week before slipping on Friday as optimism over the virus subsided. Stock futures have fluctuated on Monday as investors work out what to make of the latest developments. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was set to open slightly lower as futures dipped, along with the        S&P 500      and the        Nasdaq.      Chinese officials reported 97 deaths on Sunday, a new daily record, diminishing hopes that the outbreak was stabilizing. However, a scientific model predicted the number of cases would peak in mid-to-late February.Companies, economists, analysts and investors have been trying to count the cost of the full impact of the virus as it continues to spread.Goldman Sachs analysts said the economic impact will be limited and investors should look to cyclical and value stocks. Goldman analysts said the virus would hit U.S. economic growth by up to 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter, but the drag would be recouped over the next two quarters and the global damage could be as low as 0.1 percentage points over the full year. “The impact of the lower global and U.S. economic activity on 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share will be limited,” Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David Kostin, said in a note.“Investors who believe the economic consequences of the coronavirus will be limited should increase exposure to cyclicals and value stocks,” they said.The bank’s sector-neutral dividend growth basket of 50 stocks has “declined sharply” alongside cyclicals and trades with depressed valuations.“If fears of global pandemic are allayed, the basket should outperform,” they added.The basket’s stocks set to outperform the most are semiconductor company            Skyworks,      IT services provider            DXC,      hotel and casino operator            Wynn Resorts,      technology company            Broadcom      and construction equipment manufacturer            Caterpillar,      the note said.Goldman analysts said barring a “significant change” in circumstances, the impact of coronavirus on U.S. equities would be focused on a select group of companies most exposed to China — including restaurant owner            Yum China      and component manufacturer            Qorvo.When it comes to sectors, airlines and gaming will be the most affected, due to travel restrictions and U.S. casinos operating in Macau — particularly as the Lunar New Year is the most lucrative time for gaming, they added.U.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"After a recent earnings-driven run to a new 20-year high, it might be time to take profits in            Intel      stock.Chip giant Intel (ticker: INTC) last week posted blowout results for the December quarter, with revenue and profits well-above estimates—and March quarter guidance likewise dramatically above Street expectations. Driving the strong results: a surge in sales for data center server processors and surprising strength in personal-computer processors.But there are reasons to worry about what happens from here. Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard this morning reduced his rating on Intel stock to Market Perform from Outperform, while maintaining a $70 price target, which was just above Friday’s closing mark at $68.47.“We see a number of potential positive and negative catalysts for Intel’s shares, but do not know which will come first,” Richard wrote in a research note published Monday. Richard notes that heading into the quarter, he had above-consensus expectations for 2020, but that the rest of the Street has caught up with him—and that upside and downside potential are about evenly matched.On the one hand, Richard sees some potential good news ahead:But he has a few reservations:Intel shares are down 3.2%, to $66.27.

1,"The technology stocks in the S&P 500 have returned about 50% over the past year, far ahead of any of the index’s other 10 sectors.If tech shares do cool off, the ones that sport attractive yields and trade at relatively low price/earnings ratios could be smart plays. That’s partly because a big yield can offset some capital losses, and partly because tech shares fitting those criteria are already cheap and don’t have as far to fall as more highly valued names.  Market Data Center:  Dividends To find some stocks that meet these defensive criteria, Barron’s started with a subset of the tech stocks in the S&P 500 index—notably those with yields of at least 2.5% and P/E ratios no higher than 15 times the current fiscal year’s profit estimate. Excluding some companies that have had big returns over the past year, as well as some smaller-cap stocks, Barron’s narrowed the initial group down to four companies that met these criteria. Of course, these companies come with investor concerns—hence their relatively high yields—and there are no guarantees. P/Es are based on current fiscal year estimates. Stock prices as of Jan. 17Source: FactSetThe company with the biggest yield on the list is            IBM      (ticker: IBM) at 4.7%. IBM has returned about 16% over the past year, hardly a disaster but badly trailing the tech sector. A major concern is sales growth. IBM last year earned $12.80 a share, down from $13.81 in 2018, according to FactSet. A company spokesman attributed the decline to “the impact of certain accounting rules for the purchase of Red Hat.” The consensus estimate for this year is $13.28. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October, CFO James Kavanaugh said that over the previous nine months, the company had returned $5.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.3 billion in dividends. IBM suspended its share-buyback program when it closed on its acquisition of Red Hat in July for about $34 billion. In April, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 a share, up 3%.Even though the company’s top-line growth has been challenged at times, IBM continues to generate plenty of cash flow to support its dividend. As of Sept. 30, it totaled $12.3 billion over the previous year. Read Next:  The Dow Could Hit 30,000 Five Years Ahead of Schedule. It Won’t Stop There. Cisco Systems      (CSCO), whose stock yields close to 3%, also generates a lot of cash flow. In the fiscal year that ended in July, the company’s free cash flow totaled nearly $15 billion, up from $12.8 billion a year earlier. Analysts expect the company to earn $3.24 a share this fiscal year, which ends in July, up 5% from $3.10 last year.The company, which makes data network switches, routers, and other products, said in its most recent annual report in October that it intends to return at least 50% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. The two other stocks in the table are            Broadcom      (AVGO), whose products include semiconductors used in smartphones, and            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE), whose portfolio includes servers, data storage, and networking equipment. The stocks yield 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively.Broadcom has plenty of cash flow to support its dividend, which it raised in December by 23%, to $3.25 a share. Free cash flow totaled $9.3 billion in fiscal 2019, ended in October, compared with $8.3 billion a year earlier.For its fiscal quarter that ended on Oct. 31, Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported mixed results. Revenue fell 9% year over year, but profits rose 14%, to 49 cents a share. In its current fiscal year, HPE is expected to earn $1.86 a share, up 5% from $1.77 last year, on flattish revenue growth, according to FactSet. That should be enough for HPE to boost its dividend in the mid-single digits—reassurance that some tech shares have a yield shield if the broader sector does have a selloff. Write to Lawrence C.

1,"Broadcom      (ticker: AVGO) already sports a hefty dividend—and it could be poised to get bigger.According to a research note released on Tuesday, SunTrust analyst William Stein anticipates a dividend hike that will reward investors. “While management did not explicitly guide for the late-2020 dividend increase, other financial component guidance, combined with our estimates, suggest a likely ~11% increase, assuming the company makes no significant portfolio adjustments,” Stein wrote.The chip maker kept pace with the        S&P 500      last year, climbing 29%. 2020 has brought new challenges, however, and the stock has fallen 2.5%% in January, even as the S&P 500 has gained 2.8%. But Stein doesn’t think shareholders should be worried just yet.“We believe most investors buy large/mega mature tech companies for income rather than growth, so our analytical focus for AVGO remains on the company’s ability to expand its dividend over time.He points to potential buyers for the firm’s “non-core” assets, which include its wireless and industrial semiconductor businesses. Stein values the pair at a collective $31 billion.“We expect any cash received from selling non-core assets would be deployed, at least in part, to follow AVGO’s recent strategy of acquiring infrastructure / software companies.”The analyst further justified his bullishness by citing SunTrust’s previous estimates, which predicted an increase of over 20% in the second half of 2019. Broadcom delivered and expanded its dividend by 23%. It currently pays a dividend of $13 a share, or around 4.2%.Stein raised his price target on Broadcom to $361 to $366.

0,"Traditional dividend havens such as utilities and real estate investment trusts are expected to continue that role, with yields in the 3% range this year. Those looking for more robust dividend growth should consider sectors such as health care and technology. The health and tech sectors in the S&P 500 index are expected to notch the best dividend growth this year on a per share basis, 10% for health care and 9% for tech, according to consensus estimates. Those two sectors are expected to increase their earnings this year by roughly 10%, compared with mid-single digits for utilities and REITs.IHS Markit,      a financial-data firm, expects U.S. dividends paid out to total a record $663 billion this year, up 7.2% from 2019’s levels—but below the 7.9% gain the previous year. That 2020 estimate, which excludes special dividends, covers the entire U.S. stock market, including the S&P 500.These are consensus estimates. *Estimated growth compared to previous year.Sources: Bloomberg, FactSet,Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchThe slower dividend growth “is mainly attributed to a slowdown in earnings growth when compared with 2018 earnings growth, which was boosted by tax cuts,” IHS Markit says in its 2020 forecast.  Still, there should be plenty of dividend growth this year across various sectors, starting with health care. Dividends usually grow in line with earnings, and the health-care sector, from large pharmaceutical firms to a major prescription-drug distributor, offers plenty of strength. “The amount of money spent on prescription drugs has nearly doubled over the past three decades as pharmaceuticals sales and profit margins have ballooned,” the forecast says.The consensus earnings estimate for the            Health Care Select Sector SPDR       (ticker: XLV), a good proxy for larger health-care companies, is $6.31 a share, up 8% from $5.82 in 2019.In its recent assessment of dividend trends, IHS Markit noted that the health-care sector “has shown a very aggressive capital deployment stance in fiscal-year 2019 with mergers and acquisitions being the top priority followed by rising cash dividends.”IHS Markit expects the sector to boost its dividends by 9.3%, helped by sustainable free cash flow and lower debt levels.Goldman Sachs      shares IHS Markit’s optimistic outlook for health-care dividend stocks. For analytical purposes, Goldman divides the broad market into various baskets of stocks, one of which focuses on dividend growth. That particular basket, Goldman Sachs wrote in a note dated Jan. 3, “offers longer-term investors a premium yield while positioning for a value rotation.” Growth stocks have outperformed value names for many years, though value stocks did better in the last four months of 2019. Goldman Sachs observed in the research note that “the outlook for growth and value remains muddy” as stand-alone investments, and that “we recommend strategies that combine growth and value.” Goldman’s dividend-growth basket of stocks was recently yielding 3.6%, compared with 2.1% for the S&P 500, and it traded at a substantial discount to the broader market. These stocks offer 10% dividend growth through next year, compared with 5% for the broader market, Goldman Sachs says. The health-care stocks in the basket are            AbbVie      (ABBV), which recently yielded 5.3%;            Gilead Sciences      (GILD), 3.9%;            Pfizer      (PFE), 3.9%;            Cardinal Health       (CAH), 3.9%;            Amgen      (AMGN), 2.7%;            Bristol-Myers Squibb      (BMY), 2.8%; and            Eli Lilly      (LLY), 2.2%.  Meanwhile, the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to increase their dividends by an average of 9% on a per-share basis, based on consensus estimates. IHS Markit notes that “many of the leading tech payers have relatively large cash balances and low debt profiles, reinforcing the sector’s status as top payer.” That includes            Microsoft      (MSFT), which has regularly increased its dividend at a double-digit pace, and            Apple      (AAPL), whose net cash at the end of September totaled $98 billion. Microsoft was recently yielding 1.3%, and Apple was at 1%—both well below the S&P 500’s average of about 2%.The yields of Microsoft and Apple are also punier than the tech stocks in the Goldman Sachs dividend-growth basket. But in terms of total dividend payouts expected this year, Microsoft and Apple are expected to rank in the top five of U.S. companies, according to IHS Markit.The tech names in Goldman’s dividend-growth basket include            Texas Instruments      (TXN), which recently yielded 2.8%;            IBM       (IBM), 4.8%;            Broadcom      (AVGO), 4.2%;            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), 3%; and            NetApp      (NTAP), 3.1%.Of course, health care and tech aren’t the only sectors that offer dividend growth. Based on consensus estimates, consumer-discretionary and energy companies in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends this year by 8% on average. Consider, though, that the            Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR       exchange-traded fund (XLY), a proxy for companies in that sector, yields about 1.3%—not all that enticing. And energy stocks have lagged behind the broader market, their attractive yields notwithstanding. The            Energy Select Sector SPDR      ETF (XLE) was recently yielding about 3.7%.Utilities in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends on a per share basis by an average of 7%, a respectable gain if it occurs. However, many of these stocks have been bid up, as investors seek yield in a low-rate environment, essentially treating them as a bond proxy. The            Utilities Select Sector SPDR      ETF (XLU), for example, trades at about 19.7 forward earnings estimates, some 15% above its five-year average of 17.2 times, according to FactSet.Income investors could also turn to the financial, materials, and industrial sectors of the S&P 500 for yield growth. Such stocks are expected to boost their dividends by 6% this year on a per share basis, according to consensus estimates. Take financials, for instance. They are expected to yield 2.2% on average, and many individual banks sport even higher yields.            JPMorgan Chase’s      (JPM) was recently at 2.6%, the same as            Citigroup’s      (C).            Wells Fargo      (WFC) was at 3.8%, compared with a 2.1% yield for            Bank of America      (BAC).Although dividend growth should slow this year, there should still be plenty of yield available in various sectors. But it’s important to understand the fundamentals of a company, even if its yield is alluring. • Write to Lawrence C.

Two such firms, Pershing and Fidelity, have unveiled technology that aims to make using model portfolios easier for advisors, InvestmentNews reports. BNY Mellon Pershing Monday announced a new digital portal for managing model portfolios, while Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions is updating AMP, its digital advice platform for advisors, to allow them to create models customized to clients’ risk tolerances and defined asset allocations, according to publication. A new study by            Broadridge Financial Solutions      shows AUM for model portfolios has jumped 19% annually since 2016 to nearly $3 trillion, InvestmentNews notes. Pershing plans to start rolling out its Manager Gateway by the end of year. The system will replace the firm’s existing Manager Workstation. “One of the primary pain points for investment managers is the time they spend replicating models for different clients,” said Sarah Chain, director of global strategy and product management at Pershing. “Manager Gateway simplifies the client service experience so that model providers only need to enter models once before they’re automatically routed to investment professionals.”  --Ross Snel More and more financial advisors are relying on third-party model investment portfolios for their clients, and custodian firms have been paying attention.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"It’s no secret that financial advisors increasingly have been relying on model portfolios for their clients. A new survey puts some fresh numbers on the trend. Eight-five percent of advisors now use model portfolios, with 70% combining them with custom portfolio design, according to Broadridge Financial Solutions, which polled 500 advisors in March and April. Respondents said more than half (54%) of advised assets are now in model portfolios, but they expect that figure to hit 58% over the next two years.So why have advisors gravitated toward these off-the-rack investment strategies composed of ETFs and/or mutual funds? Sixty-five percent of respondents using model portfolios cited business scalability as a primary driver. Fifty percent said models allow them to benefit from investment management experts, and 47% said they can focus their efforts on client acquisition and retention. “By shifting assets to model portfolios, financial advisors are acknowledging that they aren’t just being asked to provide investment management expertise – they need to prioritize holistic financial planning and client service,” said Matthew Schiffman, principal at Broadridge, a fintech firm. “A focus solely on investment management limits the growth of an advisor’s book of business. As advisors find the right balance between custom and model portfolios for their practice, we foresee more assets flowing into models, particularly if usage expands among higher AUM accounts.”--Ross SnelIt’s no secret that financial advisors increasingly have been relying on model portfolios for their clients.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"When Blythe Masters, a pioneer in credit default swaps and one of the most senior women on Wall Street when she resigned from            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM) after a 27-year career at the bank, joined the blockchain start-up Digital Asset in 2015, it was seen as a coup not just for one company, but for an entire technology.Masters is now stepping down as CEO of Digital Asset, and AG Gangadhar will serve as acting-chief executive until a permanent chief is chosen. “Masters will remain involved in the company as a board member, strategic advisor and shareholder,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.In an email to Digital Asset’s staff, Masters wrote that she knows her departure “will have come as a surprise.” She said she was confident in the company’s prospects and management team. “Working as part of the D.A. family means the world to me,” she wrote, “but I also work for my family’s future and I need to focus on this for a while.”When Masters joined the company, blockchain was little understood on Wall Street at the time. Her imprimatur was viewed as a legitimizing force for a technology whose best-known use case at the time, Bitcoin, had been developed to allow for anonymous purchases of things like guns, drugs, and illegal services. Read More: 4 Women Who Make a Difference in Blockchain Digital Asset’s specific pitch was that banks needed the blockchain to speed up back office functions like trade processing, but as the bitcoin bubble grew and crypto fans clamored that it would disrupt government money and financial institutions, the broader allure was something far more vague and existential: banks needed to start using blockchain so that they wouldn’t be left behind. By whom, exactly, was unclear, other than they would be using blockchain.With Masters at the helm, the company forged partnerships with companies like Google (GOOGL),            IBM      (IBM),            Accenture      (ACN),            Broadridge Financial Solutions      (BR) and PricewaterhouseCoopers, along with the Australia Stock Exchange and various clearing houses.Now, the cryptocurrency bubble has burst and despite years of trying, there have been very few significant, tangible results from banks’ experiments with blockchain.

1,"Many agree that the U.S. proxy voting system is a mess. But no one is sure how to fix it.The current system, in which shareholders cast votes through a host of intermediaries, came in for wide-ranging criticism at a meeting of the Investor Advisory Committee on Thursday. The IAC is group of private citizens charged with advising the Securities and Exchange Commission on regulatory priorities. The proxy voting system was the subject of a Barron’s cover story earlier this summer (“Proxy Voting Is Broken and Needs to Change,” July 6).SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and other SEC commissioners were in attendance for part of the meeting, held at the SEC headquarters in Washington.SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said that the current proxy voting system is “far from ideal…. There is no question that it is inefficient and can lead to erroneous results. We can and must do better.” Generally, the presentations—which were given by representatives of issuers, activists, large institutional investors, and proxy solicitors—concurred with that view. One of the two most common themes was that the SEC should seriously consider using blockchain technology, or an independent distributed ledger, to improve the ability of shareholders to know that their voting intention was properly registered and tabulated. There is no end-to-end confirmation of a shareholder’s vote, in other words.Secondly, some speakers said that to help increase shareholder voting participation in a proxy vote or annual votes, both issuers, or corporations, and dissidents in a contested proxy vote should have direct access to beneficial shareholders. Currently, roughly 75% to 85% of all U.S. shares are held in “street name” by third-party custodians, such as banks and brokers. The underlying beneficial holders are typically only known to the custodians, unless the beneficial owner specifically opts to allow his or her information be given to issuers. Important third-party intermediaries, such as            Broadridge Financial Solutions      (ticker: BR), also presented and addressed some comments that implicitly were critical of the company, which has an roughly an 80% share of the U.S. proxy communications market.The current system of proxy voting is fraught with inefficiencies and too large a margin for error, said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors. “Our members have and continue to lack confidence that their shares are always fully and accurately voted,” he said, adding that it’s time to “seriously explore” distributed-ledger technology or private blockchain operated by a trusted third party. The current system was developed for a different era and needs to be updated, added David Katz, a partner at law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. He also argued, as did others, that he is in favor of allowing issuers to communicate directly with beneficial shareholders. Most of those in favor also conceded there are privacy issues that must be resolved for this to happen. Some shareholders, for example, don’t want to be known.Broadridge’s president of U.S. investor communications solutions, Lyell Dampeer, objected to criticisms that there was no way for shareholders to confirm that their vote was properly registered and counted. Broadridge, through its electronic voting system, already does end-to-end vote confirmation, he said, when the company is also the tabulator in a vote. Broadridge’s market share of tabulation, however, is 50%.IAC member Lydia Mashburn said that the proxy voting process should be opened to market solutions and that the SEC should agree on the basic principles of how the system should work, rather than mandate a technology to be used, such as blockchain, which could become obsolete in the future. Alexander Lebow, co-founder of SAY, a financial-technology company that builds tools for shareholder engagement, cautioned the SEC to beware of blockchain as a “silver bullet” for the problems in proxy voting. “How will it be governed?” he asked. Blockchain is thought of as a public or open and independent distributed ledger, but in proxy voting the distributed ledger will be a permissions-based system. Broadridge’s fees, which are typically paid by the issuer in a vote, also came in for criticism, since they are proposed by the brokers and banks and approved by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange.Broadridge’s Dampeer said that the votes that are conducted by his company are “accurate, secure and efficient,” and that Broadridge is already subjected to numerous annual audits by the brokers and banks that use its voting systems. “We are audited more than any financial institution in the world,” he said, adding that some criticisms leveled at Broadridge are “disingenuous…. We need all the players to participate” to improve the proxy voting system. Nor is Broadridge the only proxy communications service provider, he said.Procter & Gamble      (PG) representative Deborah Majoras noted Broadridge doesn’t allow electronic distribution of proxy materials in a proxy contest. Both P&G and Trian Fund Management spent millions on repeated mailings of proxy materials last year in the P&G-Trian proxy battle. According to FactSet, it was the most expensive proxy fight in history, at $60 million.In response, Dampeer noted that no one asked the company for such a service previously and that it was building that capability now.Edward Rock, a law professor and director of the Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance at New York University School of Law, noted that Broadridge already provides end-to-end vote confirmation if it is also the tabulator. “However, if Broadridge becomes the engine of providing robustness to proxy voting, how do we handle the problem of monopoly?” he asked.The SEC plans to hold a roundtable on proxy voting this fall.

0,"A new start-up has raised funds from Steve Cohen’s Point72 Ventures as it seeks to upend the proxy-voting process.Technology platform SAY has raised $8 million in seed financing, from investors including Point72 Ventures, according to a statement today. SAY aims to “empower” shareholders by making proxy voting more accessible.The problem is access and branding, according to SAY’s co-founder and CEO, Jeffrey Cruttenden.He had earlier co-founded Acorns, which funnels users’ spare change into exchange-traded funds.“`Proxy’ is one of the most poorly branded words in history,” he told Barron’s last week. Sitting in SAY’s Soho office, he described the missed opportunity: based on what he sees through Acorns, which has squirreled away over $800 million for customers, “the new investor is stoked to learn.” But words like “proxy” and its cumbersome process keep them from getting involved, leaving them disenfranchised and mistrustful.“It can’t be worse than it is now,” Cruttenden says, sweeping his hands across the black conference table as if to wipe away the ugly current process. Owners aren’t exercising their say in a company’s choices, he says, and “companies and activists are frustrated they can’t connect with beneficial owners.”The current process does look antiquated. When corporate matters need a vote, stakeholders used to convene at shareholder meetings in person, with formal tickets and “a lot of ceremony and ritual around it,” but that has been displaced by proxy voting, remotely casting a ballot. That means stakeholders receive a big packet of information in the mail, which few actually read, and send in their response. But fewer than 30% of retail shareholders actually vote, according to data collected by Broadridge Financial Solutions, which administers the bulk of proxy voting. That leaves power in the hands of institutional investors. For example, mega-money manager BlackRock Inc. oversees $6.3 trillion, much of it in passive index funds whose holders are probably paying less close attention and may not even know they are holders. So BlackRock centralizes proxy voting in its Investment Stewardship Team, led by Michelle Edkins. She and a team of about 30 vote on over 130,000 proposals. Both activists and company management see the platform as a tool to help gather support for their causes, which are often at odds. One of SAY’s investors is a prominent activist, who through a spokesman asked to remain anonymous. SAY will help reach those paying less attention, or those deterred by the opaque language in the stack of papers they get in the mail. Starting with those investors shepherded into the market by their spare change: SAY is partnering with Acorns to “empower” those investors, giving them access to the ownership rights they already have.But Vanguard and BlackRock do not offer pass-through voting for ETF holders and vote the shares themselves, except for in some cases with institutional investors and separately managed accounts. So SAY’s utility through ETFs is limited: the platform will enable ETF shareholders to vote on their fund’s trust board, and to offer suggestions that will ostensibly then be taken to and considered by the ETF’s investment manager. For holders of individual stocks, users with accounts at participating brokers will be able to link to their holdings, get verified as an owner, and submit their proxy votes on the platform. So far, two brokers are already connected, with five more to come by the fall. (If a user’s broker is not connected to the platform, they can still verify ownership and connect with fellow owners.)Cruttenden “planted the idea” for SAY when he met Acorns CEO Noah Kerner. “Through a partnership with SAY, customers of Acorns will gain a deeper understanding of and influence over what they own,” Kerner said in the press release. SAY will allow users to submit suggestions for a vote, but they must reach a quorum for viability, just as upvoted posts rise to the top of Reddit. Cruttenden doesn’t foresee problems like those now manifesting in social platforms like            Twitter      and            Facebook      that were supposed to foster democratic participation and connection but that now seem to amplify and weaponize the worst of human nature -- or at least SAY isn’t ready to worry about unexpected externalities yet. Plus, its scope is narrower, and users’ verified ownership should confer more accountability, helping to prevent Boaty McBoatFace outcomes. Like those social media platforms, SAY is still tinkering with what context and information to provide users, so that their vote is an educated one.Similarly, SAY’s emphasis on ownership and empowerment has a populist strain. SAY putting decisions in the hands of individual investors unleashes a “democratic” power currently stifled by the existing cumbersome process, Cruttenden says. SAY helps turn them into active owners, participants in this great capitalist experiment, giving them power that had been pooling at large investing companies.“So many more people are owners than they realize,” he says. “People just want standing. People have been asking for a microphone, and never expect anyone to give it to them.” As the app tells users: “You now have SAY.”An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Even the most devoted Bitcoin convert will admit the network is slow.We noted in a December cover story that            Visa      (ticker: V) “can process 10,000 times as many transactions per second as Bitcoin’s vaunted blockchain.” Evercore ISI analyst David Togut offered slightly different numbers in a March 26 report. “Visa can process 65,000 transaction messages per second, at full capacity, compared with fewer than 10 bitcoin transactions per second.”In any case, you get the idea. Blockchain transaction = slow. So far that tardiness has created a moat of molasses that protects card issuers such as Visa,            Mastercard      (MA) and            American Express      (AXP) from Bitcoin encroachment. There are some ideas on how to equip cryptocurrencies with speed, however.Togut had some thoughts on two such suggestions at a March 22 panel hosted by Columbia Business School: “Blockchain: Recasting the Payment Industry’s Future.” Timothy Galebach, chief technology officer of Blockmason, suggested sharding. “Currently, every single node running the Ethereum network has to process every single transaction, which is why it’s slow,” Togut wrote. “With sharding, the network is partitioned into shards where only certain nodes process transactions for certain shards, allowing for greater speed. However, fewer nodes means reduced security, and risk of centralization; problems which have yet to be addressed.”We don’t think users would settle for less security. The other alternative was proposed by Jeff Bandman, a principal at Bandman Advisors and a former regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “Business practices could be put in place to allow for the slower verification process of blockchain, or a hybrid payments solution could be created utilizing both card and blockchain payments,” Togut noted.Perish the thoughts. Throughout advances in technology, users have never accommodated “slower” in their vocabulary. We refer readers to Emily Dickinson, who noted that only Death itself will wait patiently. A hybrid solution looks nice in theory, but it would still be slower than the card system alone.In a March 6 report, Togut wrote, “We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies pose limited disintermediation risk to our payments coverage, including Mastercard, Visa and American Express.” We agree completely.On the other hand, the Evercore analyst wrote in the earlier report that “blockchain offers long-term cost-reduction and efficiency-creation opportunities for our Bank Technology coverage, especially            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS),            Fiserv      (FISV) and            Jack Henry & Associates      (JKHY), and the market share leader in U.S. proxy services,            Broadridge Financial Solutions      (BR), in both transaction processing and trade settlement.”Togut also noted in the March 26 note that Bandman said “the underbanked” would benefit from cross-border blockchain transactions, as “too many intermediaries exist and transactions fees are high.” It’s telling that            Western Union      (WU) and            MoneyGram International      (MGI) have partnered with digital currency Ripple.Speaking of ripple, that’s all cryptocurrencies can manage to make in the card moats at this point.

0,"Having diversified product lines and the platforms to distribute them is the key to winning the asset grab.In the first quarter of this year, the incorporation of robo-advisors -- essentially asset-allocation software on top a brokerage platform -- drove net new assets in the online channel up 8.6% to $39 billion, according to data from Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR). Vanguard and Charles Schwab (SCHW) have seen organic asset growth of more than 10% in the last 12 months relative to other firms that had a combined growth of 2% over the same time period. Thats likely due to its robo-advice platforms.Schwab reported that assets in its Intelligence Portfolios grew to $16 billion while Vanguards Personal Advisor Services surged to more than $50 billion by the end of last year. Both firms also have hit the sweet spot or a 30/70 mix of active and passive products. The overall market has the inverse of that.More and more firms are following this model of diversification, whether it is traditional distributors such as Edward Jones and Raymond James entering the asset management business, or asset managers such as BlackRock and T. Rowe Price establishing robo-advisor platforms, said Frank Polefrone, senior vice president of Broadridges data and analytics unit.Robo-advisors or financial technology rather was the subject of this weeks Fund of Information column. Panelists at the Morningstar Investment Conference last week debated what constitutes innovation in finance. Ritholtz Wealth Managements Josh Brown aka the Reformed Broker noted that innovation is just repackaging. Mutual funds were considered innovative when they replaced closed-end funds remember? IBM Watson Financial ServicesPaolo Sironi said that robo-advisors in their current state is not an example of sustainable innovation.

If you dont have a way out, you wont make any money. Fee wars generate volume, but not value.

0,"Innovations in investing have turned many of us unto “automatons,” writes Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig. Consider these numbers. Four leading robo-advisers — Betterment, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, Vanguard Portfolio Advisory Services and Wealthfront — have roughly doubled their assets in the past year, to $77 billion.In 2016, 82% of new retail investments coming through financial advisers (more than $400 billion) went into index funds and ETFs, according to            Broadridge Financial Solutions,      which helps process such trading. All told, U.S.-based exchange-traded portfolios have amassed $2.6 trillion. And target-date funds hold $915 billion, according to Morningstar.For end investors, and many advisors, this kind of investing doesn’t require much thought or effort. “Many of the newest converts to automated investing, including plenty of financial advisers, are undoubtedly chasing the hot performance of index funds,” Zweig writes. “When markets cool, they will flee — potentially turning a dip into a dive.”However, there’s little evidence that automated investing has driven up stock prices. Market valuations were at their modern highs in 1999, when index funds held less than 10% of all stock, points out Fran Kinniry, an investment strategist at Vanguard. Since then, index funds have roughly tripled their share, but stock valuations have fallen by almost half.

After the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      rallied 115.27 and the S&P 500 closed at a new high of 3,046.77 on Wednesday, stock futures were pulling back this morning. One reason? Bloomberg Television reported China has doubts it can reach a long-term trade deal with the U.S. More data is ahead—weekly jobless claims and consumer spending—which come on the heels of another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy looks strong enough not to need more cuts in the future. We’ll see.Investors will be reacting to results from those big tech names and wading through more reports, from            DuPont      (ticker: DD),            Clorox      (CLX), and others.

In the Global Technology Fund he manages, he offers up alternatives like decades-old            Texas Instruments      (TXN). “It makes power management integrated circuits, a very small, very cheap chip that controls the flow around a circuit, and basically allows a battery to last as long as possible,” said De Gale, who adds that Texas Instruments has very little competition. Then there’s            EPAM Systems      (EPAM), a software-services company that made Fortune’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list for 2019. “They write software for companies that can’t do it themselves, mostly working for non-tech companies,” so in a sense a “sophisticated niche business,” he says.Also            Cadence Design Systems      (CDNS), which writes software to help chip designers design chips.

1,"A Trump administration ban on U.S. companies using telecommunications equipment produced by the Chinese tech giant            Huawei,      coming on the heels of a trade war between China and the U.S., is sending shivers through the semiconductor industry.In a report issued Monday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves says semiconductor firms are being affected differently by the Huawei ban and the tariff fight, depending on their focus and exposure, but all bear risks.“We view the Huawei and China/US relationship as a negative overhang on the semiconductor space and a lift of either would likely send the Semiconductor industry materially higher,” Steves writes. “In addition, if the relationship between the US and China worsens, positive earnings results could be quickly offset by another tariff hike.” The back story. Huawei (ticker: 002502.Shenzhen) is among the world’s largest buyers of semiconductors, a key component in electronic devices. A Trump executive order, signed last week, effectively bans the company from doing business inside the U.S. The ban came as faltering talks between the U.S. and China sparked fears of a trade war.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF       (SMH), which tracks the semiconductor industry, had dropped 11.6% from April 24 through Friday. What’s new. In his note, Steves identifies the semiconductor firms that have an exposure to Huawei, and those that are exposed to the trade war.In the Huawei column, Steves places            Analog Devices       (ADI),            Synopsys       (SNPS),            Cadence Design Systems       (CDNS), and a handful of others.Huawei is a major builder of equipment needed for new 5G networks, and the semiconductor firms most at risk, Steves writes, are those with exposure to 5G. Analog Devices, for example, owes 12.5% of its total revenue to 5G, he says.In the China trade war column, Steves places            Advanced Micro Devices       (AMD),            Nvidia       (NVDA), and others, because they are exposed to the risk of new tariffs in a prolonged trade war.

0,"Trade concerns heightened over the weekend as President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on Chinese imports. U.S. stocks tumbled on the news, but things could deteriorate further, say analysts, especially for this year’s winners—semiconductor stocks. The back story. The U.S. stock market has been rallying this year with both the        S&P 500      and        Dow Jones Industrial Average      reaching new highs not long ago. The optimism and tranquility in the market was partly driven by the wide anticipation of a U.S.-China trade deal by the end of this year, which could boost slowing growth in the world’s two biggest economies. The technology stocks in the S&P 500, especially, have been the best performers, surging over 25% year to date. What’s new. On Sunday afternoon, President Trump took investors by surprise, tweeting that he intends to increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, and is also considering placing 25% tariffs on another $325 billion worth of goods that aren’t currently affected by the tariffs. Later Sunday evening, Chinese negotiators were reportedly considering delaying the trade talks scheduled for this week in Washington.S&P 500, Dow and        Nasdaq Composite       futures all fell sharply on the news, and remain down in trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently down 245.36 points, or 0.9%, to 26,259.59, while the S&P 500 has tumbled 30.27 points, or 1.0%, to 2,915.37 and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 99.79 points, or 1.2%, to 8,064.20.Any additional tariffs—and higher raw material input costs as a result—could spark downward revisions to earnings expectations, wrote Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, as “corporate management teams and the sell-side community have only baked in the current tariff regime to guidance and stock level forecasts.”But the re-escalation in trade tensions might “have a greater price impact than fundamentals may indicate,” according to            Morgan Stanley      strategist Michael Zezas. The latest developments come at a “tricky time,” wrote Calvasina, as the current market condition is especially vulnerable to bad news due to investors’ excess euphoria and overvaluation.Calvasina noted some “eerie similarities” between the current conditions and those preceding the S&P 500’s peaks in January and September last year. In the futures market, net longs had crossed above 2010-2014 highs to approach the peaks in late January and late September 2018. As of early May, retail investor sentiment suggests that the percentage of bears has fallen back down to January 2018 lows. RBC’s model capturing 17 valuation metrics for the S&P 500 has also returned to levels that preceded both of 2018’s major market peaks in January and September.What’s more, as Calvasina pointed out, this year’s winning stocks have already started to show signs of fatigue. The best performing stocks in the S&P 500 during the first quarter of 2019 have been flat over the past few weeks. Calvasina thinks the S&P 500’s short-term peak might come sooner than anticipated and recommends investors sell and take away the profits while they still can, particularly in areas that have been helped by the improved outlook for trade. It might also be time to add some defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities, wrote Calvasina. Looking ahead. A delay or even cancelation of the deal with China is particularly negative for industrial and semiconductor stocks, wrote Calvasina. Both sectors have outperformed strongly this year partly due to the improved outlook on trade.RBC analyst Mitch Steves sees major concerns for GPU producers such as Advanced Micro Devices (ticker: AMD) and            Nvidia      (NVDA). If the trade tensions escalate, he wrote, the U.S. might prevent shipments of semiconductors to China, or tax them heavily.The manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment, such as            Lam Research Corp      oration (LRCX),            Applied Materials      (AMAT), and            ASML Holding      (ASML), are also susceptible to trade-related volatility given that “the large products would be easily traceable and taxable,” wrote Steves.One safer space might be the electronic design automation software, or EDA, producers, which only have about 10% of revenue exposed to China and continued to show no slowdown in demand, growth, or profitability, according to Steves.“Despite the volatility in the semiconductor industry, we’ve seen solid results from both            Cadence Design Systems      (CDNS) and            Synopsys      (SNPS) and private start-ups continue to ramp in both the United States and China,” wrote Steves, “We think the number of design starts will remain robust, and as the competition heats up at smaller and smaller nodes (7nm and lower), EDA will become a more important component of the R&D budget.” Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.comTrade concerns heightened over the weekend as President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on Chinese imports.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0," Could Have Been Worse. The markets failed to recover their losses, but they sure as heck tried even as they ended Tuesday in the red. Any time the Dow can close down 126 points after being off more than 500 has to be considered a victory. Still, the disappointing earnings continued, as            Texas Instruments      tumbled following disappointing guidance after the close. In today’s After the Bell, we…Not even            Tesla’s      (TSLA) 13% jump could save this day. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      lost 125.98 points, or 0.5%, to 25191.43 on Tuesday, while the        S&P 500      fell or 0.6%, to 2740.69 and the        Nasdaq Composite      declined 0.4% to 7437.54.The S&P 500 is now down 6% since the start of October. While many struggle to make peace with the market’s plunge, Edward Jones strategist Kate Warne thinks what we are seeing isn’t unusual and reminds investors that stocks have historically experienced pullbacks of 5% or more about three times a year. “Investors think this pullback is strange, but this really is just return to normal.” she told Barron’s.Still, things are far from perfect. Third-quarter earnings have been solid, but investors are looking further into the future. Next year is expected to deliver just over 10% earnings growth as compared with this year’s 20%. That’s causing a misplaced worry among investors that earnings have peaked.“It’s not peak earnings, it’s peak earnings growth.” Warne told Barron’s, “The pace is still positive, just the growth rate isn’t as high as it was.” She believes investors will eventually digest this information, and realize it’s not the end of the economic cycle just yet.Part of the volatility might just be the market adjusting to the tighter monetary policy. “The major global central banks have gone from easing to tightening and thus assets must reprice to adjust to monetary policy normalization—or at least the attempt to achieve normalization,” writes Yousef Abbasi, strategist from INTL FCStone.That’s not enough to end the bull market, though. Deutsche Bank’s Parag Thatte believes the recent decline is just a short-term pullback, continuing the defensive rotation and end-cycle fears we’ve seen from earlier this year. Going forward, Thatte believes that market has priced in the growth slowdown already and we’ll likely see more asset inflows to U.S. equities in the last two months of the year.Investor outflows from U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs were muted at the start of the recent decline, and a big part of that plunge could be attributed to the automatic selling from systematic strategies such as volatility control funds, Thatte explains. On Oct. 11 and 12, the volume reached about $50 billion. If volatility returns to normal level, these funds will gradually reverse the trade and buy more equities again in the next two to three weeks.If history of previous pullbacks can offer any guidance, the pace of outflows should moderate beginning next week, Thatte writes. In fact, the last two days have already seen assets flowing back in again, despite the renewed pullback, he notes.If only it would show up in the returns.Cadence Design Systems      (CDNS) shot to the top of the S&P 500, helped by strong third-quarter earnings.

0," Call It a Comeback. After spending much of the day in the red, the Dow battled back to finish in positive territory on Monday. The Nasdaq, however, continued to slide as investors lightened up on tech stocks. Square tumbled after a bearish analyst expressed skepticism over the company’s latest move. In today’s After the Bell, we…A bad day turned out to be not so bleak—unless you were a tech stock.The        S&P 500      finished little changed, though down, at 2884.43, while the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      rose 39.73 points, or 0.2%, to 26,486.78. The        Nasdaq Composite      tumbled 0.7% to 7735.95.The Dow was off as much as 223.96 points, or 0.8% earlier in the day, but staged a comeback to end its two-day losing streak. But there’s no hiding the fact that tech was very, very weak. The        S&P 500 Information Technology      index fell 1.2%, as companies like            Autodesk      (ADSK) and            Cadence Design System      (CDNS) fell more than 3%.The question becomes whether the overall market can handle weakness in tech. Right now, you’re seeing the same combination of defensiveness and plays for higher rates keeping the overall market roughly flat, as we discussed last week. But it would sure be nice to see tech and the Nasdaq make a comeback.  Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at Bay Crest Partners, thinks the Nasdaq can. He notes that the        Invesco QQQ      ETF (QQQ) has fallen nearly 2% below its Bollinger band but remains above its 200-day moving average. That’s occurred eight other times since the 2014, and when it has the exchange-traded fund has gained a median 3.41% over the next 10 days. Of course, there was the 3.45% drop that occurred in 2015 to worry about, though Krinsky doesn’t seem to worry about that. “Yes, this could always be an August 2015 scenario (we don’t think it is), but aside from that type of event, we think buying into this weakness rather than selling it will prove to be the correct move,” he writes. Morgan Stanley’s      Michael Wilson isn’t so sure. He notes that growth stocks, of which tech is a big part, have been able to “remain immune” to higher rates as long as rates don’t get too high. But he thinks that level might have been breached last week, when the MSCI World Value Index had its best day relative to the MSCI World Growth Index since May 2009. “The break higher in interest rates last week appears to be the tipping point, enabling the rolling bear market to complete its unfinished business in these last bastions of safety,” he says.I have a feeling we’ll find out soon enough.Arconic      (ARNC) shot to the top of the S&P 500 Monday, helped by reports that private-equity suitors are pursuing the metals maker.Arconic rose $1.56, or 7.1%, to $23.40.People close to the deal told Reuters that            Blackstone Group      (BX),            Carlyle Group      (CG), Toronto’s            Onex Corp.      and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have allied to make a joint bid for Arconic. However, other bidders may emerge, with Arconic planning to decide on a sale later this month, according to the anonymous sources.Year to date, Arconic is down 14.2%, and it’s off 13.7% in the latest 12 months.Salesforce.com      (CRM) sank to the bottom of the index, amid a broader selloff for tech.Salesforece.com lost $6.42, or 4.1%, to $148.65.There wasn’t much in the way of specific company news for Salesforce.com, but tech in general had a difficult day, with the Nasdaq’s declines steeper than the S&P 500’s, and weakness across the board from chip makers to social media stocks feeling the pinch.Salesforce.com is up 45.4% year to date, and it’s gained 54.3% in the past 12 months.

0,"The best money managers aren’t the ones who make no mistakes. They don’t exist. The best are ones who learn from their mistakes and improve as a result—and the only way to tell if you’ve found one is if a manager’s been around long enough to see the improvement. Few managers are as long-tenured as Paul Hogan of the        FAM Dividend Focus      fund (ticker: FAMEX), and few have had as strong returns over the past five years, when he bested 99% of his peers in Morningstar’s Mid-Cap Blend category with an 11.7% annualized return. The fund’s record is a little less impressive over the past 15 years—it has lagged behind its benchmark, the Russell Mid Cap Index, by 1.4 percentage points annually—though it still has beaten its peers. Hogan, 55, has run the fund with his co-manager and Fenimore Asset Management’s founder, Thomas Putnam, 75, since its inception in 1996.The fund’s stellar performance in recent years can partly be attributed to a valuable lesson Hogan learned: Don’t sell winning stocks too soon. In 2001, he purchased shares of department-store operator            Ross Stores      (ROST) for a split-adjusted $2.73 a share. Now they trade for $114. Excluding the dividend, that’s a return in excess of 4,000%. But FAM Dividend—which holds just 31 stocks and has Ross as its second-largest position—didn’t enjoy the full benefits of that investment. It sold some of its Ross shares in 2006 after they had more than doubled, to $5.94.“At the time we were thinking, ‘Oh, that’s great. We got our double,’ not expecting we’d get more than 4,000%,” Hogan says. Read more: Microsoft, Dollar General, and 2 Other Picks From a $14 Billion Fund The problem was a lack of confidence in his own research into Ross’ competitive advantages. “Part of the secret sauce is you have to know how good the good ones really are,” he says. “When we bought Ross, we were worried about            Walmart      being a very tough competitor.” But Ross has a unique business model for its 1,500-plus stores: special deals each month on new merchandise. That creates a “treasure hunt” mentality among customers—something neither Walmart (WMT) nor            Amazon.      com (AMZN) has successfully emulated. Ross “can probably double the number of stores from here,” Hogan says. “They’re not even in the Northeast yet, so they have a long way to grow.” The evolution of Hogan’s strategy somewhat mirrors that of            Berkshire Hathaway’sWarren Buffett. Hogan and Putnam started out as classic value managers—much in the style of Ben Graham and David Dodd, authors of the value-investing treatise Security Analysis. That strategy was to buy cheap stocks, get a final shot of returns, then sell when they hit a valuation target. Putnam, whose father started a textile business in the 1930s, learned about Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) because it also originally was a textile company, so he began to follow Buffett. After his father left the textile business, Putnam launched Fenimore Asset Management in 1974 with the proceeds from its sale.Back then, it was easier “to be a Graham and Dodd disciple,” Putnam says. “In the mid-1970s, you could buy companies for two, three, four times earnings on a price/earnings basis...Now it’s more important to find companies with high returns on invested capital.” Hogan now embraces a high-quality investment style, seeking strong businesses that can fend off competitors—much like Buffett does. But the fund looks for midsize stocks that pay dividends and are less widely known, rather than an Amazon or            Apple      (AAPL). When the fund launched, it was called FAM Equity Income, as many value stocks had high dividend yields. Gradually, as valuations increased, the fund shifted to companies with growing dividends. “Increasing the dividend payment is really a reflection of management’s belief that the company can continue to grow,” Hogan says. He won’t buy a company unless it’s growing its dividend by at least 10% a year, he says, and midcap companies can grow dividends faster than large ones. The fund changed its name in July to reflect the shift in approach. *Holdings as of September 30th, 2019; All Returns as of Dec. 2, 2019; three- and five-year returns are annualized. Source: MorningstarThe fund’s largest sector weighting is growth-oriented tech stocks, at 27% of its portfolio. Diversified information-technology services company            CDW      (CDW) is its top holding, at almost 7%. The companys dividend growth rate has averaged 44% over the last three years. “CDW’s providing solutions like cybersecurity, cloud computing, and virtualization to satisfy all the needs of small businesses,” Hogan says, adding its goal is to grow two to three percentage points faster than the U.S. IT market. “They’re taking market share, and the larger they get, the more advantage they have versus their competitors.” Smaller companies tend to focus on selling and servicing one tech company’s products—such as            Microsoft’s      (MSFT)—because hiring technicians licensed to service different companies’ products is expensive. Yet CDW’s scale enables it to diversify. “They have a lot of people who are licensed and certified on a number of different technologies,” Hogan says. “So they can tailor a solution for a customer based on what type of hardware that customer already has.” Hogan also has a 12.9% allocation to financial-services companies, although he says he’s “very choosy” about the banks he invests in. After a lengthy economic recovery, he feels the only way bank-loan credit quality can go is down. One bank favorite is            First Hawaiian      (FHB) because it dominates its region’s market, is selling off risky loans to buy back stock, and has dividend growth averaging 10%. “Other companies have tried to come into the Hawaiian market and compete, and they haven’t really been very successful,” he says. Still, there is always room for improvement. FAM Dividend Focus’ expense ratio is 1.24%, which Morningstar rates “above average” for its fund category. “Our shareholders have gotten exceptional performance for what they paid for it,” Hogan says. Thanks to the strategy tweaks he’s made, they certainly have of late.

0,"Cisco Systems      stock is less attractive because of the slowing global economy, according to Piper Jaffray.The networking company is a leading maker of routers, switches, and security products. It is regarded as a noted bellwether of corporate spending trends.In August, Cisco (ticker: CSCO) said it was seeing a negative impact from the trade war, with the company unable to close some of its deals. Its shares fell 9% because of mixed commentary, a day after it reported financial results for the quarter ended in July. Cisco stock has underperformed the general stock market. It shares are up 10% this year versus a 23% gain for the        S&P 500.      Piper Jaffray analyst James Fish lowered his rating to Neutral from Overweight for Cisco stock, predicting lower spending from its customers over the next year. “Our downgrade centers on a slowing macro-environment across Enterprise and Service Provider, as well as cycles hitting a peak earlier this year, a lack of a near-term catalyst,” he wrote. “We see better opportunities for out-performance/risk-reward in other parts of our coverage.”Cisco shares were down 1.2% to $48.25 Monday morning. The        Nasdaq Composite Index      was down 0.3%. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. The analyst said the company needs to buy more companies in the software and security space to boost its revenue growth. He also said the market for corporate technology hardware will be “more challenging” into next year, which is negative for Cisco. Fish cited the uncertain recent commentary from technology distributors, including            Arrow      (AROW),            CDW       CDW) and            Insight      (NSIT). Other Wall Street analysts are also mixed on Cisco. About 56% have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 44% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet.

1,"Most mutual-fund investors understand the danger of style drift—when a manager inexplicably veers from his or her strategy. It can detract from long-term returns and wreak havoc on an overall portfolio. In a similar vein, co-managers Chuck Severson and Ken Hemauer take issue when a holding in their $2.1 billion        Baird MidCap      fund (ticker: BMDSX) shows signs of thesis drift.“Over time businesses can change, but if, for example, we invest in a company because of its strong organic growth and one day wake up and hear it made a risky acquisition, we’ll move on,” says Severson, 58. That happened five years ago, when one of the fund’s holdings at the time,            Dollar Tree      (DLTR), unexpectedly announced it was acquiring Family Dollar. The morning the news broke, Severson was already at his desk when Hemauer walked by and, without missing a beat, told him: “I know, we’re selling Dollar Tree.”In hindsight, it was the right decision, considering Dollar Tree’s tricky transition—it is now closing hundreds of Family Dollar locations. More important, it speaks to how the Milwaukee-based managers stay on the same page and, in the process, deliver consistent returns. Over the past decade, the fund has returned an average of 16.2% a year, better than nearly 70% of mid-cap growth funds—and with less volatility. The fund tends to beat its benchmark in a rising market and lose less in a down market. Note: Holdings as of 5/31. Returns through 7/8; five- and 10-year returns are annualized.Source: MorningstarBoth Severson and Hemauer learned the rigors of fundamental research in the Applied Security Analysis program at the Wisconsin School of Business in Madison. After graduation, Severson began his 30-year career at Baird, where he helped launch the firm’s mid-cap growth strategy in 1993 and in late 2000 rolled it out as a mutual fund. A year later, he hired fellow UW alumnus Hemauer as an analyst covering financials and in 2010 promoted him to co-manager. The team is rounded out by four senior analysts covering cyclicals, health care, consumer, and technology.While the fund has always focused on owning high-quality companies with the potential to grow earnings year after year, the managers put tighter parameters around their process in 2006. They instituted a written report that outlines the investment thesis based on five key criteria: profitability, revenue growth, industry outlook, management quality, and expectations for the stock. That “Prime” process, as they call it, grounds all of their investment decisions. “We wanted to take the emotion out of decision-making by putting our investment thesis on paper so we can go back to it when the bullets are flying in the market,” says Hemauer, 51. An idea also needs to fit in with the rest of the portfolio. The managers keep the fund’s sector weightings within 75% to 125% of its benchmark, the Russell Midcap Growth index, but with just 50 to 60 holdings. “The individual slots within the portfolio are really valuable,” Hemauer adds.Recently, the largest slot went to            Euronet Worldwide      (EEFT), a holding since 2015 that is part of the booming payments industry, but “uniquely so,” according to Hemauer. CEO Michael Brown co-founded the company in 1994 after observing there weren’t a lot of ATMs in Eastern European countries relative to other developed countries. Euronet—which is actually based in Kansas—keeps growing its ATM business in overseas markets. “They are very efficient at identifying where people are moving, where they’re vacationing, where they’re transacting, and they’ve built a network of 40,000 ATMs,” Hemauer says. Meanwhile, Euronet has parlayed that expertise into a thriving money-transfer business in U.S. markets. Hemauer thinks the company can continue to post double-digit revenue growth. At 24 times 2019 earnings, the stock trades at a discount to many of its payments peers, and could command a higher multiple as the market realizes there is more to its growth story than cash machines. The market also assumes that e-commerce is the death knell for distributors, but specialized wholesalers still have a role. Consider wholesale computer distributor            CDW      (CDW), a fund holding that sells computers and technology services to small- and medium-size companies, government organizations, health-care firms, and educational clients. Roughly 60% of its revenue is recurring, says Severson, and the company has consistently grown revenue at a faster clip than information-technology spending overall. “We like these leading distributors because they are kind of the arms dealers of their industries,” says Severson. “You don’t have to pick who’s got the best product right now because that can change very quickly.” Yet these companies are the first line of defense for their customers, who count on them to keep things running smoothly in their businesses—and their backyards. Another top holding,            Pool Corp.      (POOL), is the world’s largest distributor of pool supplies and the dominant player in U.S. markets. The fund first bought the stock in 2016 and increased its position in 2017, when shares sunk about 20% to less than $100, over concerns            Amazon.com      (AMZN) was jumping into the pool business. The stock has since buoyed to $191 as investors realized Pool Corp. is a formidable competitor in its niche, thanks to its size, deep ties with contractors, and the nature of its business. “If you’re a pool owner and your pump breaks in the middle of the summer, you’re going to do what you need to get it fixed,” says Severson, noting that more than half of sales are for maintenance and repairs.Most mutual-fund investors understand the danger of style drift—when a manager inexplicably veers from his or her strategy.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0," Raymond James & Associates Based on recent results, information-technology distributors and resellers are performing better than their key vendors.We believe that investors may be surprised by this divergence in performance, which we attribute to diversification of product and vendor offerings, a heavier focus by its vendors on selling through the channel (to gain market share), growing traction with key service offerings and a focus on the middle market.As incumbent and emerging vendors battle for supremacy in the new era of IT, where mobility, cloud, convergence and the software-defined data center are just a few of the trends redefining the technology landscape, the channel is likely to play a key role influencing customer adoption and migrating existing infrastructure to these new architectures.With original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) facing more uncertainty about their future-growth trajectories, valuation multiples have compressed. On the other hand, the market seems to be increasingly recognizing the resilience of the channels value proposition and its relevance in a physical, virtual and even a cloud environment, as valuation multiples have recently expanded. Moreover, financial performance by the channel has been more impressive, with most resellers and distributors exceeding revenue and EPS expectations over the past two quarters, while OEMs have reported either disappointing results or guided future expectations below consensus.Our top channel stocks remain          Ingram Micro      (ticker: IM) and            CDW      (CDW) as we believe they provide a growing and diversified portfolio of next-generation solutions. However, we note that            Avnet      (AVT) and particularly            Arrow Electronics      (ARW) are executing well in the data-center space and are leading the charge on forging relationships with interesting startups that can be the next generation winners in the data center.We think            Synnex      (SNX) will capitalize on some of these trends but is focusing more intently on its business process outsourcing (BPO) strategy via the            International Business Machines      (IBM) acquisition.            Tech Data      (TECD) has also reported strong results in the data center (especially in North America), but its service offerings are more limited in scope than other broadline distributors. -- Brian G.

1,"Zoom Video Communications      stock has nearly doubled year to date and insiders and an early investor are selling a slew of shares of the videoconferencing firm. The gains are in sharp contrast to the recent stock selloff that has taken the        S&P 500      index, a measure of the broader market, down 24% year to date.As millions of people, barred from their offices because of the coronavirus pandemic, now work from home, Zoom (ticker: ZM) has seen a “very big jump” in its service, according to founder and CEO Eric Yuan. Zoom has added more new active users this year than in all of 2019, The Wall Street Journal noted.Stock sales by Zoom insiders have also surged, and now total $129.4 million for 1.3 million shares, an average per-share price of $97.04, according to Securities and Exchange Commission records filed through Tuesday night. Most of the sales were made through what are known as Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, which automate transactions based on criteria set by company insiders, such as trading price and volume. When the conditions are met, the trades are triggered. The plans are meant to remove the potential bias an insider may have from knowledge of material nonpublic information.Zoom insiders had a truncated year to sell stock in 2019, as the company had an initial public offering in April, priced at $36 a share, and the so-called lockup expiration wasn’t until October. Early shareholders and employees aren’t allowed to sell shares until a few months after an IPO. Open-market sales by insiders in 2019 totaled 305,878 shares for $21.8 million, an average price of $71.24 each.CEO Yuan has been the biggest seller this year, with 419,918 shares sold for $38.5 million through March 17, an average per-share price of $91.79 each. The former            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) executive didn’t sell any Zoom stock on the open market last year, but he did sell 587,787 shares in connection with the IPO. Yuan’s personal account continues to own 25.4 million class B supervoting shares, with options to buy 500,000 supervoting shares for as little as $3.77 each. He also owns 20 million more supervoting shares through trusts that he shares control over. Class B shares carry 10 votes each, while Zoom’s publicly trade shares carry one vote each. According to Zoom’s registration form, after the IPO and before his latest sales, Yuan was expected to have overall control of about 21% of the company’s voting power.Zoom didn’t respond to a request to make any of the insiders available for comment on their stock purchases.Roy Benhorin, chief accounting officer, is the next biggest seller, shedding 290,000 shares year to date for $25.3 million, an average price of $87.09 each. Benhorin now owns 221,327 Zoom shares, restricted stock units representing 16,050 shares, and stock options to buy 210,000 supervoting shares. In October, he sold 100,000 shares for $7 million.Entities related to Emergence Capital Partners, an early investor in Zoom, have sold 146,336 shares on the open market for $16.8 million, an average per-share price of $114.81. The firm continues to own about 18 million supervoting shares of Zoom.Santi Subotovsky, a general partner of venture-capital firm Emergence Capital who sits on Zoom’s board, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the transactions.Janine Pelosi, Zoom’s chief marketing officer and another Cisco alum, has sold 168,461 shares this year for a total of $15.8 million, a per-share average price of $93.64. Pelosi now owns 154,489 Zoom shares, and options to buy 374,650 supervoting shares. Last year she sold 58,380 shares on the open market for $4.8 million, an average price of $82.57 each.Carl Eschenbach, a Zoom director and a general partner at venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, sold 130,385 shares on March 6 through an estate-planning vehicle for $14.7 million, an average per-share price of $112.89. He now owns 380,967 Zoom shares through his vehicle. Sequoia, another early investor in Zoom, now owns 5.4 million supervoting Zoom shares. Zoom director Jonathan Chadwick has sold 110,000 shares for a total of $11.7 million, an average price of $106.13 each. Chadwick, a former chief financial officer of            VMware       (VMW), now owns 290,000 supervoting shares of Zoom.Zoom stock closed at $135.18 on Tuesday for a year-to-date gain of 99%, more than triple the $36 IPO price.

1,"The        S&P 500 was climbing Tuesday morning but still deep into a bear market and priced about 13.5 times one-year forward earnings. That is much lower than the five-year average of 17 times, not to mention the recent high marks that exceeded 19 times. Amid the broader market turbulence, analysts at Jefferies Research find one group of stocks compelling—the high-quality names with strong fundamentals and attractive valuations, or priced at what Jefferies called “practically stealing.”It offered a list of stocks spanning all sectors that investors would want to own across a business cycle, despite potential near-term drawbacks. Some held up well in the last downturn, some enjoy a business model well-differentiated from peers, and some have strong cash flow to support appealing dividends in a low-rate environment.Here are a few highlights from the list in each sector:  Communication Services Videogame stocks are less-exposed to the Covid-19 disruption and possibly even stand to benefit as people spend more time on home entertainment. Within the group,            Activision Blizzard       (ticker: ATVI) is a favorite of analyst Alexander Giaimo. The company enjoys a solid product pipeline, aggressive mobile approach, plus 100% self-owned intellectual property. Giaimo expects Activision to see two straight years of double-digit earnings growth. Consumer Discretionary While casinos were among the hardest hit during the coronavirus selloff,            Las Vegas Sands       (LVS) is a stable long-term bet once the pandemic impact fades, according to analyst David Katz. The gambling giant offers a strong balance sheet, stable management team, and continuously growing share in key markets such as Macau and Singapore, with a few capital projects under way. While both areas have experienced sharp drawdowns in visitor volume because of the pandemic, things likely won’t get any worse from here, Katz said.  Consumer Staples While global economic growth remains a concern, chocolate and other indulgence foods typically sell well in recessionary environments, noted analyst Rob Dickerson.            Mondelez       (MDLZ), known for its various snacking products such as the Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, is well-positioned relative to peers, with higher exposure to faster-growth markets such as China. During the coming periods of extensive self-quarantine, pantry-loading among U.S. consumers could offer further tailwinds to the company. Energy Oil’s fallout might be shippers’ boon. The recent price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has flooded the market with millions of barrels of additional crude and led to a price collapse of the commodity. But            Euronav       (EURN), the largest crude tanker company in the world, is likely to benefit as tanker demand increases, both for inventory building and floating storage, according to analyst Randy Giveans. After strong results from the fourth quarter, the company has stated that the first quarter of 2020 will be even better. Another positive for investors: Euronav has a policy to return 80% of its net income to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Financials The recent Fed rate cuts have been negative for bank stocks that make part of their profits from interest rates on loans. But the price downturn has also offered an attractive entry point for bank stocks with long-term value.            SVB Financial       (SIVB), for example, is trading at only 1.3 times tangible book, compared with its 2.3 times historical average. The commercial bank, focusing on funding early-stage high-tech companies, is well-positioned to capitalize on the rebound in innovation markets once the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic subsides, analyst Casey Haire wrote. Health Care While            Gilead       (GILD) stock has been rising lately in hope for the potential coronavirus treatment remdesivir, its valuation remains cheap, noted analyst Michael Yee, currently trading at just 10 times earnings. If remdesivir can show “even a marginal benefit” in clinical trials, the stock’s multiples could further expand. Gilead is a relatively safer stock among biopharma peers, Yee said, because of the company’s minimal exposure to China and lower share of sales in Europe. The firm also has a strong balance sheet, offers an attractive yield of 3% to 4%, and will continue to deploy capital toward pipeline-building acquisitions. Industrials Cintas Corp.       (CTAS) generates about 80% of its revenue from uniform rentals to corporate clients, largely sold as a program for the entire length of contracts, analyst Hamzah Mazari said. As a result, employees’ absence at work shouldn’t harm Cintas’ revenue stream. The company’s exposure to the hardest hit end markets—such as hospitality and energy companies—is limited, Mazari wrote. An economic downturn could also make Cintas’ competitor            Aramark       (ARMK) sell its business sooner than expected, giving Cintas an opportunity to swoop in at an attractive valuation. Information Technology Over the past 20 years,             Cisco Systems       (CSCO) has proven its resilience during periods of uncertainty, meltdown, contagion or crisis, noted analyst George Notter. This includes the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, fears over an emerging-markets slowdown in 2011, concerns about Huawei competition in 2012, and continuous worries about workload migration to the cloud from 2015 to 2018. Investors that bought the stock on the back of each crisis, however, were rewarded later on. Looking forward, Notter thinks the company is likely to ride higher again, along with the digital transformation of businesses around the globe. Materials Rio Tinto      (RIO) is one of the largest iron ore miners in the world, with a strong balance sheet. According to analyst Chris LaFemina, the company generates significant free cash flow through the cycle, has relatively low geopolitical and operating risk, and pays a large dividend—currently yielding more than 8%. Because of its financial strength, Rio Tinto is also well-positioned to take advantage of an economic downturn to add value through merger-and-acquisition deals, LaFemina said. Real Estate With schools moving classes online and companies asking employees to work from home, the self-quarantine expected in the next few weeks will create a surge in demand for internet infrastructure.            Equinix       (EQIX) owns a large number of internet-exchange facilities across dozens of global markets, which allow internet service providers, digital content providers, cloud services, enterprises, financial services, and others to connect their networks. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies are customers of Equinix, according to analyst Jonathan Petersen. The dividend yield of 1.8% is below the average of REIT peers, but the company has been increasing its dividend at a nearly 10% annual rate since it converted to a REIT in 2015.

1,"Starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, most residents of the San Francisco Bay Area will be subject to a “shelter in place” order issued this afternoon by the region’s public health officials, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The order will continue at least until April 7. It affects San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Costa Costa and Alameda counties, an area with a combined population of 6.7 million people. The region includes the headquarters of many of the country’s largest technology companies, including            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Facebook      (FB), Alphabet (GOOG),            Intel,Cisco Systems      (CSCO),            Netflix      and many others. Not initially included in the order are Sonoma, Napa and Solano counties.All nonessential gatherings of any size will be banned, along with nonessential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit.” People may travel for shopping for necessary supplies, health care, and providing aid to family and friends who need assistance, and for non-residents returning to their home outside the Bay Area. Airports, taxis, and public transit will remain operational, but only for essential travel.People in the affected area will still be able to shop for food and household supplies, and to seek medical care. They will be able to go outside for walks or exercise as long as they keep six feet away from anyone they don’t already live with.Older residents and those with underlying health problems are to stay inside at all times except for health care. The order calls for “routine medical appointments” and elective procedures to be canceled or rescheduled. Businesses allowed to operate during this period, according to the San Jose Mercury News, include health-care providers; businesses that provide food, shelter, and social services; food retailers, including convenience stores; pharmacies; child-care facilities; gas stations; banks; laundries; and businesses necessary for maintaining the safety, sanitation and essential operation of a residence.Santa Clara County had 114 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Monday morning.

1,"Zoom Video Communications      has been one of the few stocks to rally amid the market rout, on the assumption that demand for their videoconferencing software will spike as more people cancel meetings and work from home. Now, there is some evidence to support the theory. But the stock’s lofty valuation seems to discount the potential additional revenue. In a research note on Thursday, RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin reports that over the first nine days of March, daily average downloads for the videoconferencing platforms Zoom (ticker: ZM),            Microsoft       Teams (MSFT), and            Cisco Systems      ’ (CSCO) WebEx were up 183%, 103%, and 64%, respectively, over their average the previous nine months.Zukin finds that daily average downloads in March for Zoom are about 240,000, versus a recent average of 85,000. He says that historically each download translates to about $11 of incremental annual revenue. After adjusting for the fact that most of the incremental downloads are coming from free channels, he estimates that if you assume additional downloads continue at the current pace through the end of the April quarter, Zoom would generate an extra $67 million in revenue in the January 2021 fiscal year and $75 million the following year. He sees potential revenue upside of 6% in fiscal 2021 and 5% in fiscal 2022, to $1.12 billion for this year and $1.69 billion for next year. (And note that those bull-case estimates are already way, way above the Wall Street consensus at $917 million for fiscal year 2021 and $1.22 billion for fiscal year 2022.)Yet Zoom already trades for 26 consensus fiscal year 22 revenue, or about 24 times his previous optimistic case; add on the revenue from the recent spike in downloads, and the multiple drops to about 18 times. That is still not cheap—Zukin thinks to get the valuation down to the 15 to 16 times revenue range, you would need 8 to 10 months of downloads at the current elevated pace, or alternatively, a more aggressive Zoom monetization strategy.So despite the additional anticipated revenue, Zukin keeps his Sector Perform rating and $110 target on the stock. Zoom on Thursday was up 2.8%, to $113.06. Year to date, the stock is up 66%. Write to Eric J.

1,"Technology stocks led the market’s rally to record heights, but the largest tech names have been swept up by the recent selling wave. Most of the leading tech companies now at or near bear market declines, down roughly 20% from their mid-February highs.The        S&P 500 Information Technology      sector closed at 1440.20 on Monday, down exactly 20% from its Feb. 19 peak. The info tech sector doesn’t include all of big tech -- (            Facebook      ticker: FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are in the Communications Services sector, for instance -- but the pain is generally universally. Microsoft      (MSFT) and            Apple      (AAPL) are hanging on to their position as the only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion, but both have suffered in the recent selloff. Microsoft is down 4.5% year to date, and off more than 20% from its closing high in mid-February. Bear markets are defined as drops of 20% or more. Apple is down 9% year to date and almost 19% below its recent peak.Amazon      (AMZN) and Alphabet, both of which made brief appearances above the $1 trillion market level, have since fallen substantially. Amazon has performed relatively better than the other tech giants, but it’s still off 2.6% for the year and 17% from last month’s peak. Facebook (FB), the fifth largest U.S. company by market cap, is down 17% year to date, and 22% from its February highs.Cisco      (CSCO), the largest networking equipment company, is down 21% for the year and 24% from its February highs.            Intel      (INTC), the leading chip maker, is off 15% for the year and almost 25% from its peak last month. IBM      (IBM), which got a lift from its recent announcement of a CEO change, is still down 12% year to date, and 24% from the stock’s February high.            Oracle      (ORCL), which only fell 3% Monday, is down 13% year to date, and 17% from its recent peak.            Salesforce.com      (CRM) is off 7% for the year and 22% from a February high.Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), which has become a popular play on the rush to remote meetings in the face of the rapid spread of coronavirus, was down just a fraction on Monday and remains 67% higher on the year.            RingCentral      (RING), a unified communications company which resells Zoom’s videoconferencing services, fell 3% Monday, but it’s still up 24% for the year. Netflix      (NFLX), seen by some investors as a bet on more people choosing to find entertainment at home, was down 6% Monday, but it remains 7% higher for the year.            Roku (ROKU),      the other leading streaming play, is down 28%. On Monday, it fell 5.7% to $96.26, closing below $100 a share for the first time since September. Write to Eric J.

0,"The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      jumped 1,294 points, or about 5.1%, outstripping the previous record gain in points—a surge of 1,086 on Dec. 26, 2018—by more than 200. The percentage change on a given day, of course, matters more than the point change. By that measure, Monday still looks great. The 5.1% jump ranks in the top 2% of the more than 31,000 trading days in the history of the Dow. Investors can breath a sigh of relief after last week’s swift selloff, which saw the Dow plummet 12.4%. Coronavirus fears, however, are still lurking beneath the surface. Consider stock in            Walmart      (ticker: WMT). The retailer and            Apple      (AAPL) were the big gainers on the day, both rising more than 7.5%. Apple stock was up after Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz upgraded shares to the equivalent of Buy from Hold. Walmart, on the other hand, appeared to rise because investors expect a business bump from consumers prepping for potential trouble from the coronavirus.            Costco Wholesale      (COST), another source of giant containers of food, bleach, and tissue paper, rose 10%. Stock in            Target      (TGT), another big-box retailer, rallied almost 6%. The worst-performing stock in the Dow was            Disney      (DIS), rising only 2%. Its underperformance might have been due, in part, to its large theme-park business. Investors, it seems, are shunning stocks dependent on large gatherings of people. Stock in airline            JetBlue Airways      (JBLU), for instance, fell about 1.3%. Cruise operator            Carnival      (CCL) shares fell about 1.2%. The biggest point gainers in the Dow were Apple, as well as            Boeing      (BA), and            UnitedHealth Group      (UNH). The Dow is a price weighted index. It weights the value of stocks in the index by share price and not by market value like the S&P 500, so stocks with higher share prices have more sway.Dow      (DOW) and            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), which trade in the $40 range, were relatively weak contributors, adding just 15 of the almost 1,300 daily point gain. Stock in Boeing and Apple, on the other hand, costs closer to $300 a share. There were no decliners in the Dow; all 30 stocks rose.

0,"As investors cast around for bullish plays on the coronavirus crisis, they have latched on to videoconferencing stock Zoom Video Communications, which has soared 70% year to date to an all-time high, driving the stock to a $32 billion market capitalization. That is 35 times the $867 million in revenue Wall Street expects for the company’s January 2021 fiscal year. Zoom Video (ticker: ZM) reports results for fiscal 2020 next Wednesday. For the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $175 million to $165 million, with non-GAAP profits of 7 cents a share. For the full year, Zoom sees revenue of $609 million to $610 million, with non-GAAP profits of 27 cents a share. Investors will be listening carefully for any hints that the company’s business is getting a material boost from the virus issue. A second focus will be how the situation is affecting its large, China-based engineering team.Zoom Video isn’t the only company offering videoconferencing software, but it is the only public pure play. (            Microsoft      (MSFT),            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) and            Alphabet’s      (GOOG) Google all are in that market.)            RingCentral      (RNG), which offers a cloud-based unified communications platform for business that includes videoconferencing, is up 45% year to date. It seems to be getting attention as people seek other potential winners from the virus outbreak.The market is so wildly enthusiastic about the prospects for Zoom in a world in which travel is increasingly perceived as risky—Israel this week advised its citizens to avoid all foreign travel—that shares of            Zoom Technologies,      a China-based microcap communications-hardware company with the ticker ZOOM, spiked 54% on Thursday. Zoom Technologies has nothing to do with San Jose-based Zoom Video. In other words, some people are buying the wrong Zoom. This isn’t the first time that has happened. In a lengthy blog post on Wednesday, meanwhile, Zoom Video CEO Eric Yuan outlined how the company is responding to the virus.“The growing epidemic has broadened my view on what it means to be a video communications technology provider in times of need,” Yuan wrote. “I know many organizations are grappling with how to maintain business continuity and keep employees engaged amid the threat of the virus, and I’m compelled to help anyone who needs it. It’s my responsibility as Zoom’s CEO—and Zoom’s unique responsibility as a company—to do everything in our power to support those impacted by the coronavirus outbreak by committing our reliable technology, expanded access, and agile customer service.”He said that for free users in China, the company has lifted a 40-minute limit on meetings with more than two participants. “Zoom has provided free services and technical support to NGOs, such as charitable foundations and medical institutions, to assist with disaster relief efforts,” he said.And he said the company launched a videoconference platform to support online education in China, including Tsinghua University, the University of Science and Technology of China, Nanjing University, and Shenzhen University.One company that could be affected by the issue in China is Zoom Video itself. Its financial filings note that the company has “a high concentration of research and development personnel in China,” with more than 700 employees as of Oct. 31, about 29% of the company’s total head count. The company generates about 19% of revenue from Asia.Zoom Video (the real one) is up 7.5%, to $114.87. RingCentral is up 24% to $240.67. And Zoom Technologies (the wrong one) is up 51% to $6.36.

All Rights ReservedNokia      shares are giving back most of the ground they gained yesterday, as analysts express doubts about the logic and veracity of a Bloomberg article published Wednesday suggesting that the troubled communications-infrastructure company is considering strategic alternatives that could include a combination with arch-rival            Ericsson.Nokia shares (ticker: NOK) spiked 6.1% yesterday on the Bloomberg article, which reported that “people familiar with the matter” said that Nokia could consider merging or joining with Ericsson (ERIC) or some other company. The article noted that given the small number of players in the sector—Nokia, Ericsson, and Huawei Technologies together dominate the market for 5G wireless infrastructure—a combination with Ericsson would raise substantial antitrust issues.Reuters followed up on the Bloomberg report and asserted that it simply wasn’t true, in their case citing “a source close to the company.” A spokesperson for Nokia told Barron’s yesterday that the company doesn’t comment on speculation as a matter of policy.Analysts who follow Nokia have weighed in on the speculation, and generally find the notion of Nokia teaming up with Ericsson implausible. J.P. Morgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande writes this morning that a deal with Ericsson is “completely unlikely.” He finds a combination with            Samsung Electronics      (005930.Korea) “more likely but not substantially so,” given that Western governments and regulators want more players in the sector, not less. Deshpande says it would make more sense for the company to sell to a U.S. buyer, but that obvious choices like            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) and            Apple      (AAPL) aren’t likely to be interested given Nokia’s relatively low margins. He adds that “a smaller U.S. technology company exposed to government contracts could have interest,” but admits that “we cannot identify an obvious acquirer.”Citi analyst Amit Harchandani writes that he doesn’t rule out the possibility that Nokia could be an acquisition target, and like Deshpande finds a U.S. buyer a possibility. But he also finds an Ericsson transaction “highly unlikely, due to a combination of strategic, financial, cultural and regulatory considerations.”In a similar vein, Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner writes that a deal with Ericsson would be a “non-starter,” and finds the possibility of asset sales to be “more plausible, but perhaps not imminent.”Reversing yesterday’s gains, Nokia stock is down 2.9%, at $4.03, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      is down 1.9%. Write to Eric J.

0,"Dow Jones Industrial Average      components            Boeing      and            Pfizer      shares have declined for eight straight days. Stock in            General Electric      —a former Dow member—has declined for eight straight days as well. Is the ignominious run part of the market selloff, or is something deeper going on at these three firms?It’s most likely the latter. Investors are turning “risk off,” in Wall Street parlance, reducing positions as coronavirus fears rise. Twenty-nine out of the 30 Dow components are down over the past eight days, and the Dow itself has fallen seven of the past eight days.The three eight-day decliners—Boeing (ticker: BA), Pfizer (PFE), and General Electric (GE)—are suffering worse than the average stock. The trio has declined 11.1%, 9.6%, and 13% over the past eight days, respectively. The Dow is down 5% over the same span. It’s a painful run, to be sure, but it isn’t the entire story. GE, for instance, is down only 1% over the past three months, just a little worse than the 1.5% gain of the        S&P 500      over the same span. Three Dow components—            Home Depot      (HD),            Microsoft      (MSFT), and            McDonald’s      (MCD)—managed to eke out gains Tuesday before dipping into the red. Home Depot stock is up 0.5% over the past eight days. That’s the one Dow component in the green. Microsoft and McDonald’s shares are down 1.1% and 7.2% respectively. Over the past three months, all three stocks have been strong, rising 11.9%. 12.9%, and 13.7%, respectively. The strongest stock in the Dow over the past eight days is Home Depot. The weakest is            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), down about 14.7%. The strongest stock in the Dow over the past three months is McDonald’s. The weakest is            Walgreens Boots Alliance      (WBA), down about 20%. This frames how the recent selloff has impacted Dow components. It also provides some context for, say, GE investors wondering why if something deeper is going on. It isn’t. The market is facing a lot of virus-related turmoil. Hopefully, this information is something investors can look at to evaluate portfolio positions during, and after, the selloff. The Dow is down 900 points, or 3.2%, in recent trading. The S&P is off 3.1%, and the        Nasdaq Composite      is down 2.7%.

0,"The U.S. stock market is largely unfazed by the deadly coronavirus or any of the other geopolitical and other scares that have emerged in recent weeks. Yet the uncertainty around the virus and its potential fallout means even that steadfast U.S. stock bulls should rethink their positioning.Stocks have benefited from a view that the world’s central bankers will continue to offer a cushion with easy monetary conditions—and in the case of China, large amounts of stimulus—if the fallout from the coronavirus continues to spread. The        S&P 500      is up 5% so far this year, while the        iShares MSCI Emerging Markets      index exchange-traded fund (ticker: EEM) is down just 1%, even as millions are quarantined and millions more are under travel restrictions that have brought China’s economy to a virtual halt that has yet to lift. In a note to clients sent Thursday, Gavekal Research’s Tan Kai Xian outlined three potential problems for U.S. stocks as companies like            Apple      (AAPL),            Starbucks      (SBUX), and            Walt Disney      (DIS) face a hit to their businesses. “The worry is that investors will look beyond supportive liquidity conditions and start asking more fundamental questions,” he writes, adding that it is likely that U.S. earnings growth will stay weak in the first half amid virus-induced disruption. Even if economic growth rebounds in the second half of the year, as most expect, Kai Xian says companies will likely see a margin hit, given a tight labor market, that could make the eventual earnings recovery “modest at best.” While the analyst describes himself as a “circumspect U.S. equity bull” because profits will be positive even if they are soft, he outlines three possible problems weak profits could cause:Does this mean the end of the bull market? The Gavekal analyst doesn’t think so, but he sees the concerns as a reason for investors to reduce any overweight to growth stocks and take a more neutral stance between growth and value.In a separate Thursday note,            Bank of America      strategist Savita Subramanian writes to clients that a lot of good news is priced into the S&P 500 at current valuations. At 18.9 times forward earnings, the market is trading at its highest valuation since 2002—a reason she remains neutral on U.S. stocks, with a preference for value stocks.Improving macroeconomic conditions, such as the ISM PMI index jumping above 50 in January for the first time since July—the biggest month-over-month increase since 2013—bodes well for the unloved stocks, which investors have shunned despite improving data, according to Subramanian. Though she says the coronavirus outbreak isn’t good news for value-oriented stocks, she expects value to outperform in coming months given the limited impact in the U.S. from the virus.From a quantitative perspective, Subramanian and her team find that health-care and technology stocks rank best in their tactical models. But within tech, communications equipment continues to come up as a value trap, with prices falling faster than estimates and industry heavyweight            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) recently citing weak trends.Consumer-discretionary stocks remained at the bottom in the firm’s quant framework, with autos and auto components screening as value traps. Consumer-discretionary companies have been more vocal about the hit from the coronavirus, but Subramanian expects the impact to be fleeting and is still overweight the sector.

All Rights ReservedCisco      shares were taking a beating Thursday morning on investor worries about the outlook for the network equipment provider, with orders for its wares falling around the globe. While Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer said in an interview that guidance for the current quarter ending in April was “spot down the fairway,” in line with expectations, weakening orders nonetheless led some analysts to think the guidance is too optimistic.A quick review: For the fiscal second quarter ended in January, Cisco            ﻿      (ticker: CSCO) reported revenue of $12 billion, down 4%, in the middle of its guidance range of down 3% to 5%. Adjusted earnings per share were 77 cents, at the high end of the range of 75 cents to 77 cents. Product revenue fell 6%, while service revenue rose 5%.For the current quarter, Cisco sees revenue falling 1.5% to 3.5% from a year earlier, a range of $12.5 billion to $12.8 billion, bracketing current consensus at $12.6 billion. Cisco sees profit for the quarter on an adjusted basis of 79 cents to 81 cents a share, in line with estimates. But as Kramer said, there was widespread weakness in orders. Overall, orders were down 6%—worse than the 4% drop in orders in the first quarter. Asia-Pacific was down 4%, dragged lower by a 30%-plus decline in China. In the region comprising Europe, the Middle East and Africa orders were down 1%, with particular weakness in the U.K. In the Americas, orders were down 8%, hurt by weakness in both the service provider and data center segments. Kramer said it could take a few more quarters for orders to turn positive.J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintains an Overweight rating on Cisco shares, but concedes that the quarter offered fodder to feed the bears. “While for the bulls on the stock it would represent a semblance of stabilization of headwinds that will be accompanied by stabilization in earnings, at the same time for the bears the earnings announcement is likely to offer enough to latch onto, including continued moderation in product order trends—which if sustained could make the stabilization temporary,” he wrote in a research note. “We see limited near-term catalysts, either in the form of macro or impending product cycles.”Needham’s Alex Henderson wrote that the weakness in orders “marred the print,” noting that enterprise orders were down 7%, commercial orders were off 4% and service provider orders were down 11%. Henderson said the guidance could have been worse.Kramer said the latest guidance contains no haircut for the impact on the supply chain because of the coronavirus, and Henderson thinks the virus could have been used as an excuse for a far more conservative approach to the outlook. “We remain at a Hold, but, hey, it could have been worse.”MKM Partners analyst Michael Genovese asserted in a research note that the guidance for the current quarter looks aggressive, given the order trends. He noted that orders have been decelerating for four straight quarters, because of softness in enterprise spending, various country-specific issues and, in particular, trade troubles in China. Genovese said his work finds that Cisco tends to underperform the market when product orders are decelerating. He said he “doesn’t like” that the revenue guidance is materially stronger than orders and that Cisco “seems to be counting on Services persistently outgrowing Products,” a trend which he does not think is sustainable in the long run. “We would potentially be more positive on Cisco if we could call a sustainable improvement in the Product order rate, “but the tenor of the macro environment makes that difficult at the current time.”Cisco shares were down nearly 6% late morning. The decline has knocked more than 20 points off the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.       Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedCisco Systems reported financial results for the fiscal second quarter on Wednesday that were in line with guidance—the report offered neither unexpected upside nor nasty surprises. For the quarter, the networking-hardware company reported revenue of $12 billion, down 4%, which is right in the middle of its guidance range of down 3% to 5%. Adjusted earnings per share were 77 cents, at the high end of the guidance range of 75 cents to 77 cents. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 76 cents share.Cisco (ticker: CSCO) said product revenue fell 6%, while service revenue rose 5%. Gross margin was 64.7%, up from 62.5% a year earlier. Non-GAAP gross margin was 66.4%, up from 64.1%. Revenue was down 5% in the Americas, 3% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 1% in Asia.For the current quarter ending in April, the company sees revenue falling 1.5% to 3.5% from a year earlier, which implies a range of $12.5 billion to $12.8 billion, bracketing current consensus at $12.6 billion. Cisco sees profits for the quarter on an adjusted basis of 79 cents to 81 cents a share, with current consensus right on the button at 80 cents. The company expects non-GAAP gross margin in the quarter of 64.5% to 65.5%.Cisco also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny a share to 36 cents a share. In the quarter, the company bought back $870 million of common stock.“We executed well this quarter by delivering strong margins and EPS growth while driving more software and subscriptions,” Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer said in a statement. “Our increased dividend shows confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and demonstrates our commitment to shareholder return.”In an interview with Barron’s, Kramer said the January quarter results were at the high end of guidance, and that the third-quarter projection was “spot down the fairway” with previous Street estimates. She says Cisco has “executed well” through some of the issues the company raised on the previous quarter’s call, with weakness in carrier spending and certain other segments. Cisco is starting to see some wins in hardware for both 5G and WiFi6, and the company had “overall solid execution,” she added.That said, Kramer also noted that orders in the quarter were down 6%, which may have disappointed some investors. Asia-Pacific orders were down 4%, a decline she said was “purely driven by China,” where orders were down over 30%. Without China, Asia-Pacific orders would have been up 3%, she says. EMEA orders were down 1%, dragged down by a double-digit decline in the U.K., where demand was hurt by Brexit, in particular in the public sector. Americas orders were down 8%, with a slightly smaller decline in the U.S., reflecting both service provider softness ahead of a ramp in 5G investment, and weaker revenues in data center servers, where soft pricing on DRAM tends to pull down system prices. With DRAM pricing starting to improve, that should eventually become more of a tailwind for the company. Kramer noted that Cisco doesn’t guide to order growth, but nonetheless said it could take a few more quarters for orders to turn positive.Asked about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, she says it isn’t really reflected in guidance. But Cisco does rely heavily on both component suppliers and contract manufacturers based in China, and she says it could have an impact. The question is how quickly factories can get ramped up to capacity, and whether then can get the requisite parts and workers in place, she said.Cisco shares were down 6.4% to $46.72 at 11:03 a.m. Thursday.

0,"The enterprise-software sector isn’t going to be a haven from the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at both            Citigroup      and Jefferies weighed in on the group Wednesday morning, and both made wholesale estimate cuts for the enterprise-software companies they cover. These companies aren’t directly subject to supply-chain issues or reduced consumer demand, but they have an assortment of vulnerabilities nonetheless as the coronavirus dampens economic activity worldwide.Citi’s Walter Pritchard asserts that “the global reaction to the outbreak will cause some short-term impact on the ability of software companies to close business.” He notes that a number of companies report earnings this week—including            Adobe      (ticker: ADBE),            Oracle      (ORCL),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and            DocuSign      (DOCU)—which will provide a fresh look at the impact of the virus on software demand. He’s keeping a close eye on Adobe and Oracle, both of which report February quarters and which have “meaningful Japan exposure.”Pritchard sees the companies affected by both soft demand in Asia and risk to high-touch sales models as travel is curtailed and trade shows and meetings are canceled. He also expects a hit to more transactional revenue, like advertising. Companies more tied to recurring revenue, where selling is less required, will be less vulnerable, he says. Pritchard cut estimates for many, but not all, of the companies he covers, noting that the most significant cuts affect            Ceridian HCM      Holding (CDAY),            Check Point Software Technologies      (CHKP),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD),            Dynatrace      (DT),            Guidewire Software      (GWRE), MicroStrategy (MSTR),            Open Text      (OTEX),            PTC      (PTC),            Splunk      (SPLK),            SAP      (SAP), and            Zscaler      (ZS).In a similar vein, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill cut estimates for 40 companies in his coverage universe for their current fiscal years by 1%-3%. Thill notes that over the past few weeks, a number of companies have already made cautious comments on the outlook.Microsoft      (MSFT), for instance, warned that it won’t reach its previous target in its “More Personal Computing” segment, which includes Windows.            VMware      (VMW) cited virus-related impact on Asian demand, and            Zendesk      (ZEN) pointed to virus risk at a recent analyst day. And Thill notes that March quarter guidance from companies on a normal calendar reporting scheduled likely provided their outlook before the global outbreak, and could be at risk.Thill says companies with exposure to perpetual licenses and multiyear on-premise licenses are most at risk, as travel restrictions reduce the mobility and impact of software sales and support staff. He cites            Check Point,Commvault      (CVLT), Oracle,            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW),            SailPoint      (SAIL),            Tufin Software Technologies      (TUFN), and VMware as companies with high license-revenue exposure. He sees more limited impact for companies with lower touch sales and implementation models. In that group, he includes            Atlassian      (TEAM),            Bill.com      (BILL),            Cloudflare      (NET),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            HubSpot      (HUBS),            Dropbox      (DBX), and Zendesk. Thill says            Intuit      (INTU) is “one of our most defensive names, with subscription-based small business accounting and predictable tax business.” He also likes            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), since “worker mobility is a potential long-term driver of incremental licenses and could benefit from increased remote working near-term.”The Jefferies analyst adds that he would be wary of companies with elevated revenue multiples, which he argues could be more vulnerable to sharp declines. Companies he covers trading at more than 15 times the next 12 months’ revenue include            Bill.com      (BILL),            Shopify      (SHOP),            Datadog      (DDOG),            RingCentral      (RNG),            Paycom Software      (PAYC), Atlassian, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and            Smartsheet      (SMAR).Thill suggests software investors focus on companies with strong fundamental stories and high profitability, calling out Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit,            ServiceNow      (NOW), and Ring Central.Amid a sharp, broad market decline Wednesday, almost all software stocks are trading lower.

Subsequent changes in holdings or intentions must be reported in amended filings. This material has been extracted from filings released by the SEC from Nov. 28 through Dec. 4, 2019. Source: InsiderScore.com e.l.f beauty      (ELF)  Marathon Partners revealed that it owned 3,897,700 shares of the cosmetics retailer, a 7.8% interest in the company. That position accounts for the sale of 110,000 shares during the span of Nov. 12 through Nov. 25 at per share prices of $16.71 to $17.56. Marathon had previously addressed an email to e.l.f.’s CEO, citing its dissatisfaction with the stagnation in the retailer’s recent earnings, held back in part by “high levels of SG&A and compensation that have prevented profit growth.” Marathon concluded its message by stating that a sale of e.l.f. was the best option to stoke shareholder value. On Dec. 3, Marathon again reached out to e.l.f., reiterating that a sale of the company was the only plausible route to raise shareholder value, as Marathon believes that e.l.f.’s “strategy to grow its core brand and build a multibrand platform in the cosmetics space has failed to create additional shareholder wealth as originally envisioned.”  Tribune Publishing      (TPCO)  Alden Global Capital disclosed owning 11,544,213 shares of the newspaper operator on Dec. 2, equal to 32% of the tradable stock. Alden and Tribune Publishing entered a cooperation agreement on Dec. 1 where Tribune Publishing increased the size of its board to eight directors from six to accommodate the appointment of two Alden representatives. The agreement further stipulates that Tribune Publishing will not increase the board above eight members from Dec. 1 to the end of June 2020. During that same period, if Alden’s interest in Tribune falls below 10%, the two Alden Capital directors will be required to step down from the board. The agreement also calls for Alden Capital to adhere to customary standstill provisions and not own more than 33% of Tribune’s tradable stock through the end of June 2020. Lastly, the cooperation agreement will be voided if Alden’s two designated directors fail to be nominated or elected at the 2020 annual shareholder meeting.Kemet      (KEM)  Magnetar Financial reported an initial position in the electronics manufacturer of 3,046,835 shares, equal to 5.4% of the outstanding stock. That stake includes the purchase of 3,045,019 shares from Oct. 2 through Nov. 20 at prices ranging from $17.99 to $26.50 each, as well as the sale of an immaterial amount over the same span. No reason was given for the investment, though Kemet announced on Nov. 11 that it had agreed to be acquired by Taiwan-based Yageo for $1.8 billion in cash, valuing each Kemet share at $27.20 apiece. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.SharpSpring      (SHSP)  Greenhaven Road Capital, citing that the stock was an attractive investment, reported a higher stake in the cloud-based marketing-services provider of 1,360,821 shares. That amount accounts for the purchase of 277,778 shares acquired on Nov. 22 at $9 apiece through a purchase agreement with SharpSpring, giving Greenhaven Road a 12.4% stake in the company. Greenhaven Road also revealed that its founder, Scott Miller, has joined SharpSpring’s board. Miller has had and “may continue to have discussions with” SharpSpring regarding a myriad of strategic and operational topics. Bloomin’ Brands      (BLMN)  JANA Partnerslowered its stake in the casual-dining chain “for portfolio-management purposes following the appreciation of Bloomin’ Brands’ stock price.” From Nov. 6 to Dec. 4, JANA sold a total of 1,440,575 shares at prices ranging from $22.62 through $23.83 apiece. It now holds 6,379,324 common shares, a 7.3% interest in Bloomin’ Brands. JANA revealed that it supports Bloomin’ Brands “announcement of a strategic review…and intends to continue to engage” the company regarding its analysis of alternatives, including the possible sale of Bloomin’ Brands.  Eastman Kodak      (KODK)  Blackstone Group (BX), through its wholly owned affiliate GSO Funds, revealed that it had “zeroed out” its position in the imaging and printing company. Without citing a reason, GSO exited its entire stake of 8,875,211 shares through a private sale transacted on Dec. 3 at $2.50 per share.  Spectrum Brands Holdings      (SPB)  Affiliates of the Fortress Investment Group (FIG) reduced their collective stake in the household-products maker to 3,855,401 shares.

Through a public offering that closed on Nov. 22, Andrea Partners sold 300,000 shares at the offering price of $20.74 each. Following the sale, Andrea Partners now owns 3,257,461 of Axonics’ common shares. Citrix Systems      (CTXS)  Elliott Management revealed a lower stake in the enterprise information-technology services provider of 6,400,000 shares, a 4.9% position. Those figures include the economic exposure to 1,100,000 shares tied to cash settled swap contracts. The reduced holding resulted from the sale of 791,000 shares “for portfolio-management purposes” during the three days of Nov. 25 through Nov. 27 at prices of $113.12 to $114.31 each. Elliott Management noted that a representative remains on Citrix’s board. Howard Hughes (HHC) Business: Real estate investment and development company. Stock Market Value: $4.9 billion ($113.96/share) What’s Happening:  Pershing Square increased its beneficial ownership to 14.8%. Key Numbers:   $2 billion: the minimum amount of noncore assets Howard Hughes plans to sell in the next 18 months $50 million: the amount by which Howard Hughes plans to cut overhead by 2021 Behind the Scenes: Pershing Square initiated its position in Howard Hughes in 2010 when it was spun off from          General Growth Properties,      and has owned a significant position ever since. Moreover, Bill Ackman has been the company’s chairman since then and has been intimately involved in every material decision the company has made. Howard Hughes recently explored a sale of the company but decided instead to implement a transformation plan that includes a new CEO; the sale of noncore assets; the continued investment in its master planned communities, or MPCs; a cost cutting initiative; and refocusing on operations and generating free cash flow. In addition to the South Street Seaport, which Howard Hughes intends to own long term, it has four MPCs with over 50 million square feet of developable capacity remaining. Successful MPC owners create significant value over time because they control the supply of land to the market and take a longer-term approach. The best example of this is Donald Bren’s privately held Irvine Co., where he turned a $337 million investment in 1977 to a net worth of $17 billion today by never selling and continually developing with a long-term vision. --Kenneth Squire   The 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund run by an affiliate of the author and not connected to Barron’s, has a long position in Howard Hughes.

1,"It’s time for software investors to get picky. That’s the advice from Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who picked up the firm’s coverage of the software sector late Monday with a flurry of rating and price target changes “to be more defensive in light of valuation and macroeconomic concerns.” Thill writes in a research note that he remains positive on the software industry over all, but adds that he advises “a more selective approach to stocks given rich valuations.”Thill raised the firm’s rating on            Microsoft      (MSFT) shares to Buy from Hold — his only upgrade — with a new target of $160, up from $93. But he goes to Hold from Buy on            Oracle      (ORCL), with a new target of $60, down from $66. Also downgraded to Hold from Buy were          Carbonite      (CARB), with a new target of $17, from $29, and            Check Point Software Technologies       (CHKP), target reduced to $115, from $140. Thill trimmed price targets on            Citrix Systems      (CTXS),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD), Dynatrace (DT),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            VMware      (VMW), and            Workday (WDAY).He adds that the high multiples associated with recent IPOs like Zoom Video Communications (ZM),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and CrowdStrike “are unsustainable.”“Given the recent macroeconomic backdrop, we favor large-cap names within our coverage universe Microsoft,            Salesforce      (CRM),            Adobe      (ADBE) and            Intuit      (INTU) with a balance of good growth and multiple support,” he writes. “We favor applications as they cannot be ‘Amazoned’ out, and we would be more selective on the infrastructure side. We would play defense on the highfliers in the short term.”As for Microsoft, Thill writes that he sees “a large diversified business with excellent visibility that has a clear line of sight into double-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future.” He sees multiple growth drivers in Azure, Office, and LinkedIn, and says the company is “levered to favorable secular trends,” ensuing profitability and free cash flow from strong growth. He also notes that Microsoft has been steadily returning capital to shareholders—the company has bought back $72.5 billion of stock since June 2014. And he points out that Microsoft shares have outperformed both Oracle and the IGV software stock index year-to-date—and over the last one, three, five, and 10 years. On Oracle, Thill notes simply that he prefers Microsoft given its faster growth rate. He adds that Oracle is losing ground in the infrastructure business as workloads migrate to the cloud. “Despite its dominance in high-end, on-premise relational database workloads, Oracle has been a laggard in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, which has weighed on growth as workloads migrate to the cloud,” he writes. Thill notes that Oracle’s revenues have about flat recently, while Microsoft continues to show growth in the low-double digits. Write to Eric J.

1," Mostly Positive Feelings. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged gains on Thursday, while the Nasdaq ended the day slightly in the red. President Donald Trump is expected to announce a summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to complete a trade deal. India’s central bank cut its main lending rate by 25 basis points for the second time this year to 6%.            Tesla      (ticker: TSLA) stock plunged after missing its first-quarter shipping expectation.            Constellation Brands      (STZ) stock climbed on upbeat earnings report. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Borders, Trade, and Jobs Stocks mostly rose on Thursday except for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      gained 166.50 points, or 0.64%, to end at 26,384.63. The        S&P 500      added 5.99 points, or 0.21%, to close at 2879.39, and the        Nasdaq Composite      slipped 3.77 points, or 0.05%, to end at 7891.78.Talking to reporters on Thursday, President Donald Trump backed off his threat to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it a “one-year warning” meant to push Mexico to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. Trump also mulled imposing tariffs on Mexican products, particularly cars. “The only thing frankly better, but less drastic than closing the border, is to tariff the cars coming in,” he said.“It’s difficult to see this as a credible threat,” wrote Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at The Wilson Center in a note on Thursday. “Imposing tariffs on cars for this reason would be a huge violation of existing trade rules. What’s more it would be immensely costly for U.S. auto producers and consumers.” Wood thinks the Mexican government will likely view the threat with skepticism and frustration, as it made significant concessions to Trump on migration last week.German manufacturers saw orders drop a sharp 4.2% in February from the previous month, missing expectations by a large margin. Compared with February 2018, order volumes were down a steep 8.4%. The slowdown in Germany increased the likelihood of economic contraction in the eurozone, with Italy already in recession and the French economy hit by protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s reform agenda.The U.S. jobs report for March is set to be released Friday, and investors are particularly eager to see the data following February’s weak results. U.S. labor market only added 20,000 jobs last month, much lower than expected. The shortfall was “a shock,” wrote Brad McMillan from Commonwealth Financial Network in a Thursday note. “Given the other signs of weakness in the economy, it raised the question of whether things were worse than anyone had really thought. That question is hanging over tomorrow’s report.”McMillan noted that job growth has come in very low twice before in recent years—once in May 2016 and once in September 2017. Both times sharp rebounds followed. “That is the most likely result this month,” wrote McMillan, “Last month’s number may have been due to terrible weather and may have been partial payback for a very strong January.” The initial jobless claims fell to 202,000 this week from last week’s 211,000, the lowest level since 1969. Economists currently expect to see March adding 175,000 jobs. But there are signs that a weaker report may be in the cards, wrote McMillan. The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed 129,000 more jobs were created in March, the lowest level seen since September 2017 and well below expectations, noted McMillan. Job growth at smaller firms, historically an engine of growth, was close to flat. Manufacturing payrolls were actually down, wrote McMillan.McMillan expects job growth to come in around 150,000 in March, below expectations but still not too worrisome. Any number weaker than that, however, might suggest a real possibility of job growth slowdown. “We have not had two consecutive months under 150,000 since 2017,” wrote McMillan. The Hot Stock Constellation Brands stock rose to the top of the S&P 500 on Thursday, on the heels of its fourth-quarter earnings report.Constellation Brands stock climbed $11.76, or 6.6%, to $191.45.Investors were heartened by the company’s core beer business in the latest quarter, as well as the growth potential of its marijuana investment.In the past 12 months, Constellation Brands stock has fallen 15.5%. The Biggest Loser Fortinet      stock (FTNT) slumped to the bottom of the index on a tough day for software stocks.Fortinet stock lost $3.99, or 4.6%, to $83.50.However, the stock was just the hardest hit among a number of growth-oriented information-technology stocks that sold off Thursday: The 10 worst-performing companies in the S&P 500 also included            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO),            Arista Networks      (ANET),            Salesforce.com      (CRM), and            Citrix Systems      (CTXS).In the trailing 12-month period, Fortinet stock has risen 53.8%. —Teresa Rivas Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com Mostly Positive Feelings.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Investors concerned about the big swoon for tech stocks at the end of last year received welcome news this week.Three large semiconductor companies announced earnings beats after the market closed Wednesday, a welcome respite from the barrage of poor forecasts and plunging stock prices for chip companies in the last round of quarterly results.            Texas Instruments      (ticker: TXN), which was the canary in the coal mine for last quarter’s miserable earnings season, beat on earnings, as did            Lam Research      (LRCX) after installing a new CEO, and            Xilinx      (XLNX). Xilinx stock rose more than 8% in after-hours trading, Lam’s gains topped 4%, and Texas Instruments’ stock was up 1.5%.Those earnings beats helped other chip companies in late trading, especially Lam’s major competitors in supplying the equipment used to make semiconductors,            Applied Materials      (AMAT) and            KLA-Tencor      (KLAC), which were both up more than 3% in after-hours action. Chip makers            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Analog Devices      (ADI) and            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM) were up more than 1% in late trading. Earlier Wednesday,            ASML Holding      (ASML) topped revenue and earnings estimates and closed with a 1.6% gain, though Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini said that the earnings beat was driven by a change in the company’s tax rate.In other earnings action Wednesday afternoon:•            Ford Motor      (F) revealed a loss to end the year — not a huge surprise after an earlier pre-announcement — and did not disclose its forecast for 2019.

Synchrony also confirmed that it was selling its Walmart loan portfolio to            Capital One Financial      (COF) (which announced earnings Tuesday).Synchrony shares rose 10.7% Wednesday, the best single-day gain in the company’s history.• Two        Dow Jones Industrial Average      components saw their shares zoom higher after earnings Wednesday.            United Technologies      (UTX) easily beat earnings and revenue expectations, and Chief Executive Greg Hayes expects the company’s segment profit to grow faster than sales for the year ahead, as the company prepares to split itself into three businesses.            Procter & Gamble      (PG) also reported better-than-expected results in its fiscal second-quarter report, though Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan will be looking for more information about why the company didn’t lift its full-year earnings forecast despite beating estimates in the first half of the fiscal year.• Shares of            Abbott Laboratories      (ABT) fell 2.2% Wednesday after the company reported a revenue miss.•            Kimberly-Clark      (KMB) announced a new strategic plan ahead of its 150-year anniversary in 2022, but investors focused on the company’s earnings and revenue misses.•            Comcast      (CMCSA) said it lost 29,000 net video customers in the fourth quarter, though the telecommunications stock jumped 5.5% Wednesday after the company posted revenue and earnings beats. MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett pointed out that even though the number of video subscribers is falling, Comcast exceeded expectations on the metric, and investors seem to have shifted their focus to the company’s broadband business.

Subsequent changes in holdings or intentions must be reported in amended filings. This material has been extracted from filings released by the SEC from November 29 through December 3. Source: InsiderScore.com  Fine Capital Partners raised its position in the children’s video content distributor to 36,532,550 shares. Its current 27.2% stake resulted from the acquisition of 2,026,300 shares from Nov. 21 to Nov. 29 at prices ranging from $2.34 to $2.61. It was disclosed that a Fine Capital portfolio manager serves on the DHXM board, and that Fine Capital has been in discussions with the company and may extend the talks, but no specific plans or proposals have been revealed. VIEX Capital increased its stake in the electronics and software firm to 2,414,057 shares, or 7.5% of the outstanding stock, including 730,000 shares underlying exercisable options. VIEX’s increased position resulted from the acquisition of 317,761 shares at prices ranging from $8.52 to $9.01 from Nov. 26 through Nov. 30, excluding options transactions. VIEX initially disclosed a 6% stake in mid-November. Canyon Capital Advisors lifted its holding to 9,040,178 ordinary shares, or 7.1% of the outstanding stock, including 1,000,000 underlying exercisable options. The higher stake resulted from the purchase of 1,401,500 shares of the oil and gas driller at prices ranging from $14.02 to $14.78 from Nov. 20 through Nov. 28. Canyon first revealed a 6% stake last month, and further argued that the proposed $2.38 billion acquisition of Rowan by U.K.-based          Ensco       (ESV) wasn’t fairly valued. Canyon said than that it planned to discuss the merger with RDC, but no update was provided in the latest disclosure. Elliott Management has lowered its position to 9,263,892 shares, or 6.9%, of the outstanding stock of the enterprise virtualization technology firm. The reduced stake resulted from the sale of 1,000,000 shares on Nov. 29 at $111.15 each, executed for “year-end tax planning and portfolio management purposes.” Elliott added that it “intends to remain a significant shareholder” in Citrix and that its representative, Jesse Cohn, will remain a CTXS director.

Combined with the latest activity, that impacted its stake only slightly, since Baker Brothers still owns 34.1% of the company, down from a previously reported 35.4%. Third Point sold 8,000,000 shares of the medical device and equipment maker, reducing its holding to 28,008,125 shares. The sale was executed as a block trade on Dec. 3 at $68.62 per share and trimmed Third Point’s stake to 5.3%. Third Point further stated that the sale was “a result of the portfolio concentration level” in BAX and that it doesn’t “currently contemplate further sales for at least 90 days,” barring unexpected events. Third Point concluded that it is “pleased with the performance of Baxter’s CEO and is confident in his ability to continue to create value for shareholders.”First Pacific Advisors (142:Hong Kong) after disclosing the divestment of nearly 457,000 shares recently, followed with the sale of an additional 562,256 shares from Nov. 27 through Dec. 3. The sales were executed at per-share prices ranging from $117.59 to $121.60. They have reduced First Pacific’s holding of the avionics manufacturer to 1,533,017 shares, equal to 5.2% of the outstanding stock.

Centerbridge Capital Partners sold 1,750,000 shares of the residential home construction firm through a secondary block trade offering that closed on Nov. 30. The offering was executed at $21.80 per share and reduced Centerbridge’s stake by slightly more than a quarter, to 8.4% of the outstanding stock, or 4,775,571 shares. Mill Road Capital Management sold 1,858,387 shares at $8.80 apiece on Nov. 28, trimming its stake in the casual dining chain by nearly a third, to 10.9% of the outstanding stock, equal to 4,804,037 shares. No reason was given for the sale. Paulson & Co. sold 175,000 shares on Nov. 28 and Nov. 29, reducing its holding of the ocean vessel operator to 2,909,100 shares. The sales, executed at prices ranging from $18.78 to $19.63, reduced Paulson’s ownership of the firm to 10% of the outstanding shares.MDC Partners      (ticker: MDCA)Business: marketing, communications, and strategic consulting Stock Market Value: $152 million ($2.64/share)What’s Happening: FrontFour Capital is considering calling a special meeting of shareholders to change the board’s composition.Key Numbers: 5.23%: common stock owned by Front Four(79.91%), (89.19%), (89.78%): MDC’s one-, three- and five-year returns, versus 4.44%, 31.27%, and 51.82% for the S&P500Behind the Scenes: FrontFour is an experienced activist investor, particularly in Canada. MDC has built a strong collection of assets through acquisitions that operate relatively independently. But it has significantly underperformed the market, and needs to shift from making acquisitions to integrating and operating its assets. The company has taken steps toward change with the resignation of its chairman/CEO, implementation of a cost-cutting plan, and announcement of a strategic review. This isn’t an uncommon situation—a company that is at a critical juncture and an investor that wants board representation to help steer it in the right direction. FrontFour wants a board seat to assist and advise in selecting the new CEO and navigating the strategic review process. MDC has responded by saying that it will continue discussions with FrontFour, but is focused on the strategic review and CEO search. Canada has many shareholder-friendly laws, including universal proxies and allowing 5% of shareholders to call a special meeting, which usually is held within three to four months. It’s very possible that this company agrees could to be sold before the end of the CEO search process or the commencement of a special meeting to change the board.  --   The 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund run by an affiliate of the author and not connected to Barron’s, has no position in the securities mentioned here.

1,"Pivoting among tech companies is as common as politicians, actors, and athletes reinventing themselves. The reasoning: Change with the times or face irrelevance.More than a year ago, David Henshall, the newly-minted president and CEO of            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), hatched a plan for the company–known for virtual private networks–to radically transform its business by developing a hybrid-cloud solution to help businesses simplify information-technology environments and link their remote employees to corporate headquarters.Citrix made the switch because it saw a market opportunity to help companies deal with the major shortage of workers globally by delivering digital work spaces that allow people to work flexible schedules and even from home. There’s a premium on being more accommodating to the workforce. McKinsey Group forecasts a shortage of 95 million medium-to-high-skilled workers globally by 2020, and some 61% of C-suite executives believe access to developer talent is crucial to success, according to a Stripe and Harris Poll.“We want to help customers face the future of a mobile work force,” Henshall told Barron’s recently over the phone. “Companies want to embrace the cloud, but it takes a while to manage the past while embracing the future.”Henshall celebrated his one-year anniversary with third-quarter earnings last month that for the fifth consecutive quarter, exceeded Wall Street expectations–adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share and revenue of $732.5 million. Subscription-based revenue, a cornerstone of the three-year plan, jumped 37%, year-over-year, to $112 million. It now accounts for 15% of total revenue, versus 10% a year ago.The results pushed shares of the company up 2% the day after it announced results; it’s up nearly 20.5% for the year, compared with 1% for the S&P 500. In the past 12 months, Citrix has gained more than $2.5 billion in market value, to its current $14.4 billion.“We believe all the pieces are in place for this cloud transition to manifest along with increased market demand,” Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research report. Ives maintains a Neutral rating on Citrix with a $115 price target, which implies about 8.5% upside from the current price.It won’t be an overnight success–          Dell Technologies      ’ (DVMT) VMware and            F5 Networks      (FFIV) are among Citrix’s competitors–but Ives and others note recent Citrix customer wins in health care and banking. At least 10 cloud deals are worth more than $1 million.Henshall says Citrix is “well ahead” of its plan to double revenue by 2020, and subscription-based growth will pave the way. He told investors on the company’s recent earnings call, “We expect 2019 to be another year of progress against this journey. The most important variable will be our mix of subscriptions to perpetual bookings. This year, we are moving that mix up to about 40%. Next year we want to target 50% to 55%.” The company also updated its expectations for fiscal 2022, calling for more than $10 per share in free-cash-flow with 75% of new bookings coming from cloud subscriptions.Customers are fast buying in to Citrix’s SaaS strategy. One such customer, Formula 1 race team Aston Martin Red Bull Racing, uses Citrix to connect teams of mechanics and engineers at race sites all over the world with its headquarters in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, the day of the race to share and dissect thousands of pieces of data in real time. The souped-up cars, which are modified supercomputers on wheels, contain 150 data sensors that measure aerodynamics and other factors. “The parsing of data in real time can mean the difference between races won and lost,” PJ Hough, chief product officer at Citrix, told Barron’s over coffee.Pivoting among tech companies is as common as politicians, actors, and athletes reinventing themselves.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights ReservedFidelity Investments won our Best Online Brokers award in 2017, a repeat of its 2016 showing.“The firm is one of the rare brokerages that maintained access to international markets when others walked away,” we noted. Fidelity’s parent company, closely held FMR, however, hasn’t had a problem cutting back on some of its investments.In the fourth quarter, FMR reduced holdings in            Nvidia      (ticker: NVDA),          Cavium      (CAVM),            Twilio      (TWLO), and            Jounce Therapeutics      (JNCE); and bulked up on            Citrix Systems      (CTXS).Chip maker Nvidia had a boffo 2017, with shares rocketing 82%, excluding dividends. We noted that one analyst said “the positive earnings-per-share revision cycle that drove outperformance in 2017 will continue in 2018.” FMR decided to cash in some chips, reducing holdings to 48.1 million Nvidia shares, a 7.9% stake, as of Dec. 29, down from 51.3 million shares, an 8.4% stake, on Sept. 30. It’s hardly a bearish move. According to S&P Capital IQ, FMR continues to be Nvidia’s top shareholder. FMR slashed its holdings in Cavium to 6.7 million shares, a 9.7% stake, at the end of 2017, down from 10.3 million shares, a 14.9% stake, at the end of the third quarter. Cavium, a maker of system-on-a-chip (SOC) products, agreed in November to be acquired by            Marvell Technology      (MRVL); each Cavium share will be converted into $40 cash and 2.1757 Marvell shares. At Wednesday’s close, that comes to the equivalent of $90.35 per Cavium share. The deal buoyed Cavium, which ended the year with a 34% gain. One reason why FMR would want to pare back on Cavium: It already is a large Marvell shareholder, with 9.8 million shares held as of Sept. 30.We pointed out in April that companies such as Twilio are vulnerable to being eclipsed by            Amazon.com      (AMZN). Twilio provides communications services for Uber, the embattled ride-sharing firm. Twilio shares slid 18% in 2017. FMR isn’t waiting for a pickup in the stock and cut about a third of its investment to 6.5 million Twilio shares, a 9.4% stake, at the end of the year, down from 9.3 million shares held on Sept. 30. Jounce hardly bounced in 2017. Shares were priced at $16 for the cancer biotech’s January 2017 initial public offering and ended the year down 20% from that. FMR cut back its investment to 2.6 million Jounce shares, an 8.2% stake, on Dec. 31, down from 3.3 million shares, a 10.1% stake, on Sept. 30.Citrix shares rose 24% last year. The software firm didn’t lose its head even after losing its head. Chief Executive Kirill Tatarinov stepped down suddenly in August by “mutual separation decision”; he hadn’t been on the job two years. After Tatarinov’s departure, Citrix went on to rise 11% through the end of the year. FMR thinks it can squeeze more from Citrix and nearly doubled its investment to 16.5 million shares, about an 11% stake, at the end of 2017 from 8.9 million shares, a 5.9% stake, on Sept. 30.Our best online broker was recently ensnared in workplace-conduct issues. Nonetheless, change has already come to Fidelity. FMR Chief Executive Abigail Johnson added the chairman title in 2016.

0,"Shares of enterprise software maker Citrix Systems (CTXS) are down down $2.47, or 3%, at $79.96, after the company this afternoon missed slightly with its revenue number, even though it beat on the bottom line, raised its full-year revenue projection above consensus, and projected revenue growth in 2018 below consensus.This won’t help the company in refuting Morgan Stanley’s claim it is “secularly challenged. CEO David Henshall said the company was “pleased with our execution this quarter and our renewed discipline in managing our business.Henshall said Citrix is driving business transformation across Citrix,” so as to “align” with “our customers’ desire to support multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments.Revenue in the three months ended in September rose 3%, year over year, to $691 million, yielding EPS of $1.22 per share, excluding some costs.That compares to consensus for $691.6 million in revenue and EPS of $1.04.Citrix’s deferred revenue rose by 13%, year over year, to $1.7 billion.For the full year, the company sees revenue of $2.82 billion to $2.83 billion, up from a prior forecast for $2.81 billion to $2.83 billion, and above consensus for $2.82 billion. EPS is now seen in a range of $4.79 to $4.81, up from the prior forecast for $4.60 to $4.65, and above consensus for $4.63.For 2018, the “preliminary” view from Citrix is that its revenue will rise by “approximately 1 to 2 percent.” That is below the average estimate for 4% revenue growth.Shares of enterprise software maker Citrix Systems (CTXS) are down down $2.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights ReservedEnteprise software vendor Citrix Systems (CTXS) is set to report earnings this afternoon, after the closing bell, and Morgan Stanley today mentioned that its analyst Keith Weiss has included the company in the firms list of 37 “secularly challenged” stocks.As Morgan Stanley’s analysts’ put it, stock-specific risk is on the rise. So, you want to prepare by looking at names that could, conceivably, deteriorate over many years: Our economics teams longtime base case of a synchronous global recovery, modest increases in inflation pressures, and a gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation has now been embraced, by and large, by the consensus. Our US Equity Strategy team has remained positive on an equity market they believe is Classic Late Cycle. At the same time, our US Quant Strategy team’s work shows that stock-specific risk is increasing (see “Quantitative Equity Research: The Great Compression”, Sept. 28, 2017). Indeed, they found that by one key measure, stocks are now more idiosyncratic than they have been since 2001. Against this backdrop, for some long term investors, it may make sense to focus not on the cycle, but through the cycle. Indeed, Morgan Stanley Research has long focused on identifying multi-year secular trends — powerful drivers that can reshape or disrupt economies, sectors, and business models over the long term. Weiss, who has an Underweight rating on Citrix stock, writes that cloud computing is undermining The shift towards Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery models lowers the value of Citrix’s core Application Virtualization franchise. While cost cutting has resulted in a significant boost to Citrixs margins in recent years, core revenue growth has struggled to remain in positive territory, likely reflecting the companys weak secular product positioning. Another abrupt change in leadership again raises questions on the efficacy of recent growth initiatives, making it difficult to garner confidence in a sustainably improving margin trajectory. While the new strategic imperative appears to focus on: 1) accelerating the shift to subscription, 2) returning more capital to shareholders and 3) further improving margins, we note an accelerated shift to cloud subscriptions would seem at odds with further margin improvement near term.

1,"The Dogs of the Dow beat stock market averages during the decade just ended. What’s more, Barron’s found that “small dogs” offer investors superior dividend yields without sacrificing too much return. How do fast dogs—the stocks with the fastest dividend growth—perform? As it turns out, pretty well. That’s a good boy. We’re a little obsessed with dogs. There is good reason though. The Dogs of the Dow is a time-tested strategy that buys the 10 highest dividend yielding stocks in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      each year. It’s a simple, repeatable strategy and it has worked. A strategy like that is the Holy Grail for investors. The success of the Dow Dogs is also what led Barron’s to dive into other simple, repeatable—and potentially winning—investment strategies. The Small Dogs are the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Russell 2000 small capitalization index with market values over $1 billion. Small-cap stocks are typically more volatile than larger companies. We showed investors cut some of the risk of owing small stocks while receiving much higher than average dividend yields. Now for the greyhounds. The Fast Dogs strategy looks at companies growing dividend payouts at the fastest rate. The        S&P 500      was our sample set. Fast Dogs just nosed out the        S&P 500      over the past three years. Outperforming in 2017, underperforming in 2018 and, essentially, matching the market in 2019. A longer historic look would be helpful, but dividend growth data is harder to come by than just dividend yields. Barron’s suspects two fundamental reasons Fast Dogs might work over the long run. First, dividend growth demonstrates to investors the future looks bright. Higher payouts are a powerful signal to investors. What’s more, investors like dividends and more money attracts more investors. The Fast Dogs for 2020 are:            Pioneer Natural Resources      (ticker: PXD),            TechnipFMC      (FTI),            Thermo Fisher Scientific      (TMO),            Newmont      (NEM),            Cimarex Energy      (XEC),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Juniper Networks      (JNPR),            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH),            Lam Research      (LRCX) and            Progressive      (PGR). That’s a nice mix of stocks across several sectors. Deciding what stocks to buy can be hard. Learning to construct a portfolio of stocks can be hard too. But looking at different factors, such as dividend growth, can help investors screen in, or screen out, various stocks and strategies. Finding a unique strategy is entertaining—and rewarding too.

1,"The fundamentals of the stock market don’t seem very appealing these days. Valuations are high, corporate earnings are flat (at best), and profitability is declining, albeit from a record level.Pricier stocks aren’t a good bet when profit margins are falling, according to Sean Darby, global equity strategist for Jefferies. And because the        S&P 500      index itself is expensive—and looks set to rise further—investors don’t have many obvious options for individual stocks to buy. Darby recommended two types of stocks in a Jan. 21 note to clients: “cash cows” and the so-called dogs of the index.By cash cows, Darby means companies with high cash flow compared to their market capitalization. Those firms have more capacity to buy back shares, which should support the companies’ valuations even if lackluster profit growth holds back the broader market’s gains, he wrote. Cash-rich companies often outperform and command pricey valuations. But focusing specifically on companies with high cash compared to their market capitalization reveals some better deals, Darby wrote. The list of those cash cows include some big-name companies, such as            Alphabet       (ticker: GOOGL),            Facebook      (FB), and            Twitter      (TWTR), which are trading close to the S&P 500’s valuation of 22 times earnings for the past 12 months. By Jefferies’ measure, Alphabet is trading at 22 times earnings, Facebook is trading at 20 times earnings, and Twitter’s multiple is 34. So they don’t exactly look cheap. But the list also includes auto, tech, and health-care companies that are cheaper than the broader index.            Ford Motor’s      (F) multiple is 7.1, for example, and            General Motors (GM)      is trading at 5.6 times its earnings for the past 12 months. Centene      (CNC) and            Regeneron Pharmaceuticals      (REGN) are trading at 13 and 15 times earnings, respectively. And            Cognizant Technology      (CTSH) and            F5 Networks      (FFIV) are trading at 15 and 13 times earnings.The 25 companies that fell furthest behind the broader index in 2019 could outperform as well, Darby wrote. That list of the laggards—sometimes called the “dogs” of the index—also includes F5 Networks. Nordstrom       (JWN),            Macy’s      (M),            Pfizer      (PFE), and            Walgreens Boots Alliance      (WBA) were among the other laggards, according to Jefferies. “It is quite plausible the ‘laggard’ rally has further to run,” said Darby. And “at a time when the S&P 500 is just shy of posting its largest ever rise without a 20% decline and the biggest bull run on record, laggards and companies with the largest potential share buybacks are still likely to perform well in 2020,” he wrote.

0," Barron’s spring 2019 Big Money poll of institutional investors found 49% of respondents bullish, 16% bearish, and 35% sitting on the fence. Ingrid Hendershot, president and CEO of Hendershot Investments, a Virginia-based investment manager, is in the neutral camp when it comes to her outlook for the S&P 500 and its fellow market measures. But she is plenty bullish on longtime holdings such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and            Booking Holdings      (BKNG). In a recent interview, Henderson, who manages $400 million, shared her views on these stocks,            Facebook      (FB), and this year’s initial public offerings. She also explained why she’s not worried about a recession just yet.  Barron’s: Thanks for taking our latest Big Money poll. What makes you think the market is fairly valued?  Ingrid Hendershot: My view is driven by valuation. If you had asked me in December, I would have said the market was undervalued and I would have been very bullish because it had pulled back so much. But with the rebound in the market in the first quarter, you have pretty much made a year’s worth of gains in one quarter. When you have a lot of hot IPOs all at once, that is always a signal to us that the market is closer to a top than bottom. It is another sign that stocks are looking fully priced overall. On an individual basis you can always find something that looks attractively valued, but for the most part we’re holding and watching at this point.  Are there any sectors that look undervalued? A number of the technology stocks that we’ve held for a long time–such as Booking Holdings (BKNG) or Alphabet—still look reasonably valued to us. There is a lot of money looking toward the Ubers and Lyfts (LYFT) that are coming public, but the old technology stocks–            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH) is another one–are still reasonably valued.            Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK.A) still appears reasonably valued. Bank of Hawaii (BOH) does, too. A number of health-care stocks have pulled back, so there are some attractive valuations there, as well.  Within tech, comparing a company like Alphabet to something like            Netflix      (NFLX) is complicated. Alphabet makes money; Netflix burns cash. Yet, both have highflying shares. How do you value these companies? We focus on free-cash-flow generation. Alphabet is generating significant free cash flow and Netflix is struggling to generate cash. We are happy buying Alphabet and would be wary of buying Netflix. Some of the newer IPOs aren’t generating any profits, so we are cautious about buying them. What is your view of Facebook stock? The company has had well-publicized challenges but the earnings keep rolling in. Facebook had its issues last year with privacy concerns and regulators coming after the company. But the valuation had pulled back so much that once people realized advertisers weren’t giving up, the stock rebounded. Facebook has gone from attractively valued to reasonably valued now. You indicated in your Big Money responses that you think the next economic recession will occur after 2022. Many people think a recession lies just around the corner. Why might they be wrong? As we listen to the conference calls of the companies we follow, the management teams aren’t seeing any sign of recession.            United Technologies      (UTX) is a broad-based company. Their management team said they are expecting 3% gross domestic product growth worldwide, with China leading the way–and China just reported more than 6% growth. In the U.S., inflation is relatively tame, unemployment is low, interest rates are low, and consumer confidence is high. And as we’ve been listening to earnings calls, I’m starting to see the strongest organic sales growth I’ve seen in years from many companies.            PepsiCo      (PEP) just reported 5% organic sales growth in the latest quarter–their highest in three years. That shows me that demand is strong. And it makes sense when consumers have more money and taxes were cut. I just don’t see a recession on the horizon any time this year or next year. Should we expect slower growth from here?  If anything, growth is starting to pick up. A lot of folks are talking about the inverted yield curve signaling a recession, but that signal can often be three years before the recession hits. We’re just focusing on what our companies are telling us.            Fastenal      (FAST) is another one—a little industrial company that reported double-digit growth in the first quarter from demand picking up on the infrastructure side. Then there’s            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ), another company we own that reported a solid quarter. From our companies’ standpoint, I’m just not seeing a recession. We’ve been in a long economic expansion, but that doesn’t mean a recession has to be on the horizon. You indicted in the poll that you believe the biggest risk the market faces in the next 12 months is a policy misstep. Can you elaborate? It is hard to say what is going to happen politically day to day, but the misstep is more likely to occur in that realm. Monetary policy was a risk as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates. Now that the Fed has stepped away from raising rates further, monetary-policy risk has pretty much been mitigated. Do you think the Fed should hold steady on interest rates for a while? The Fed has said it wants to be data dependent, and that makes sense. If wage pressures lead to inflation or growth accelerates, I don’t have a problem with them raising interest rates again. But based on where things were in December, they were prudent to take their foot off the gas think they were prudent in taking their foot off rate increases. Thank you.

1," Inch by Inch. Stocks are trying to make small gains approaching midday Monday: The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      had gained 5.19 points at recent check, while the        S&P 500      and        Nasdaq Composite      were inching ahead by 0.1% apiece. Investors took heart from data that showed consumer spending rose in February and March, while inflation remained in check. Don’t expect the market to remain stationary for long as earnings reports from            Alphabet      (GOOGL)—after the close—and            General Electric      (GE)—before Tuesday’s open—have the potential to shake things up. A Federal Reserve meeting later this week and continued U.S.-China trade talks could also move markets.

0,"Infosys      stock (ticker: INFY) was trading lower on Monday, dented by at least five downgrades for the consulting, technology, and outsourcing company after its fourth-quarter earnings report. The back story. Infosys stock is up 10.5% since the start of the year, and has risen 25% in the trailing 12-month period, touching a new 52-week high last week. However, the shares sold off on Friday after the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report. The results weren’t the problem: Infosys earned 9.36 Indian rupees per share, on revenue of 215.39 billion rupees, while analysts were modeling for earnings per share of 8.95 rupees on revenue of 214.13 billion rupees. However, the company’s full-year guidance—for revenue to grow between 7.5% and 9.5% on a constant currency basis, with operating margins between 21% to 23%—disappointed some investors.  What’s new. Infosys was hit with at least five analyst downgrades on Monday. Citigroup cut it to Neutral from Buy, Investec cut it to Hold from Buy, and Morgan Stanley cut it to Equal Weight from Overweight. Plus, at least two new bears were born: Credit Suisse downgraded it to Underperform from Neutral, and Nomura Instinet lowered the stock to Reduce from Neutral.  Looking Ahead: Citi’s Surendra Goyal is fairly representative of those who chose to move to the sidelines. He praised the past year, especially revenue momentum, but questioned Infosys’s long-term margin outlook. He also notes the report was filled with “multiple small disappointments” in terms of the quarter and the guidance, which will likely “weigh on the stock given the decent returns year to date, despite buyback support.”Yet Nomura Instinet’s Rishit Parikh took a harsher stance on the shares. He writes investors would be better served by cutting their losses, and that            Tata Consultancy Services      (EQTCS. India) looks like a better bet (although he still has a Neutral rating on that stock). His bearish stance rests on a disappointing sales outlook, margin risks, and what he sees as an expensive valuation.            HCL Technologies      (532281. India) is his favorite pick in the Indian IT space, although he also has a Buy rating on            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH). Infosys stock was down 0.4% to $10.51 at recent check.

0,"The dramatic plunge in stocks this month is a good buying opportunity, according to Goldman Sachs.The firm’s U.S. equity strategist David Kostin reiterated his year-end price target of 2,850 for the S&P 500, representing 7% upside from Friday’s close.“The recent sell-off has priced too sharp of a near-term growth slowdown. We expect continued economic and earnings growth will support a rebound in the S&P 500,” Kostin wrote on Friday. “We believe the market has moved past fair value and expect earnings growth will lift the S&P 500 toward our year-end target.”S&P 500 has declined about 4% last week and is down more than 8% this month.While the strategist said Goldman’s economists predict U.S. GDP growth will slow from 3.5% in the third quarter to 1.6% in fourth-quarter 2019, he believes the market’s drop went too far. Kostin expects better market performance as investors look forward to more positive economic releases and 7% earnings growth for the S&P 500 next year.The “sell-off appears overdone relative to fundamentals,” he wrote.For investors who want to take advantage of his bullish market call, he recommends stocks with strong balance sheets, companies with high profit margins and names in Goldman’s “high quality” stock basket –            Mastercard      (MA),            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH),            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Accenture      (ACN),            Ansys      (ANSS),            C.H.

0," Eyes Wide Shut. Stocks are in the black as investors repress fears of ratcheted up trade tensions. Major benchmark indexes spent the majority of September running in place, but appear to be moving into position to break out so far today. The Nasdaq Composite has the most work to do to get past its last record close. In today’s Intraday Update, we…  •… consider some things investors shouldn’t be ignoring;  •… worry about slowing earnings growth;  •… and note that            AutoZone      (AZO) is getting punished for missing earnings expectations.  Uncharacteristically Stable  China hit back Tuesday against new tariffs levied by the Trump administration, but investors are turning a blind eye to current events…for now. The        Nasdaq Composite,      which has risen 1% to 7970.93, is leading the charge. Meanwhile the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      has climbed more than 150 points or 0.6% to 26,215.19 and the        S&P 500      has gained 0.6% to 2906.59. Basically, the market action doesn’t match the tone of recent events. “At least for now, instead of getting us closer to the bargaining table with China, we’ve only pushed them further away as they are likely canceling their trip to the U.S. and are ready to retaliate,” writes Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Advisory Group. The latest escalation in trade wars aren’t being welcomed by U.S. businesses, particularly tech companies and consumer discretionary companies. That should be concerning to investors, because those two sectors have been leading the S&P 500 up until recently. “Despite the market long-term up-trending pattern, we have seen a slight increase in volatility particularly since Labor Day as the S&P 500 pulled back from its Aug. 29th high of 2914,” writes Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth. “The selling has been largely associated within the technology and consumer discretionary sectors as investors began to worry that increased government oversight/regulation might squeeze profits.” Pavlik, however, maintains his Overweight rating on both those sectors, as well as health care. He expects the S&P 500 to hit 3,000 in the near term, but has a year-end target of 2875—below where the index is now. Next year, he sees the S&P 500 gaining an additional 5% to 6%. Easier said than done, given the coming earnings slowdown. Tax cuts delayed a “massive slowdown” in earnings growth, says Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research Group, but the lack of improvement in pretax margins suggests that companies are already struggling to offset slightly higher wages, materials costs, and interest expenses. Companies might have to reckon with earnings deceleration as soon as next year. “Since corporate taxes are not going to be lowered again for 2019, the base effect almost assures that the growth rate will be slower,” says Clissold. The good news: Analysts are already discounting the slowdown with EPS expectations expected to slow for 10 out of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. Real estate is the exception. Trade war fears have been the primary source of investor anxiety since June, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey.So while Tuesday’s optimism might keep stocks in the black for the moment, tomorrow trade issues will be waiting for them.  Midday Movers AutoZone is down 3.3% to $722.98 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings. The auto parts retailer earned $18.54 a share on revenue of $3.56 billion.

0,"Shares of IT outsourcing giant Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) today closed down $4.31, or 5%, at $77.86, after the company this morning reportedQ1 revenue and profit roughly in line with analysts’ expectations, but forecast the results of this quarter, and the full year, slightly lower than expected.Cognizant’s Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin was kind enough to take a few minutes to talk with me by phone this afternoon.Revenue of $3.91 billion and profit per share of $1.06 in the three months ended in March was about as expected.The focus is on the forecast: this quarter, the company sees revenue of $4 billion to $4.04 billion, which is slightly less than the $4.03 billion average estimate. And the earnings-per-share forecast of $1.09 came up three cents short.For the year, the company raised the low end of its forecast for revenue, to $16.05 billion to $16.3 billion, which is a bit below the average Street estimate for $16.23 billion. The EPS, again, expected to be “at least $4.47,” is below the consensus estimate for $4.55.During our phone call, McLoughlin said the company is “off to a very solid start.” In particular, she noted the company’s higher-margin “digitization” services revenue was up 27%, and is now 29% of the company’s total revenue, which is several points higher than it was a year earlier.The reception is somewhat lukewarm today, even from the bulls, and so I asked McLoughlin about some of that feedback.For example, Keith Bachman with BMO Capital, who has an Outperform rating on the shares, and an $86 price target, wrote this afternoon that “our general take is that CTSH had a mixed quarter.Bachman noted in particular that margins were weaker than he expected when considering an accounting change, the company’s implementation of “ASC 606,” a new edict that changes the recognition of revenue.Bachman wrote: CTSH missed on margins for the quarter. If CTSH had not had a $21 million revenue and $29 million operating income tailwind from 606, operating margin would have amounted to 19.7%, which is -60bps below reported/consensus of 20.3%. I asked McLoughlin about that point. She said the company had already told the Street to expect such adjustments when it last gave its forecast. “606 was baked into our guidance,” she said. Moreover, the company’s long-term target for operating margin of 21% of sales also factors in those ASC 606 adjustments. No big deal, in other words.I asked McLoughlin if the company is planning more moves to boost margins this year, such as cost-cutting.She said Cognizant is really now reaping the rewards of having optimized its cost structure last year, telling me, “We are now getting the benefits of increasing our utilization, and reducing duplicate overhead,” among other measures.There is still some room for continued cost-optimization,” she said, though the focus is how do we drive into higher-margin businesses,” such as digitization.The other topic of conversation was the company’s business among large financial institutions. Those clients have consistently been an obstacle for Cognizant, as they wound down spending on traditional outsourcing. The group was again a blemish on this quarter’s results.“We did see a little recovery” last quarter, she said, toward the tail end of Q1, but it’s too early to say that that is a transformation.

0," Here are some things going on today in your world of tech:The market opened shaky, the Nasdaq slipping 21 points but quickly rallying, and is now up 17 points at 7,133.36. Amazon.com (AMZN) is on pace to close above Microsoft (MSFT) for the first time ever, with a market cap of $706 billion or so, versus $697 billion for Microosft, according to the data gurus at Dow Jones. That would make Amazon the new No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization. Snap assessment  Snap (SNAP) is one of the stand-out gainers, rising $4.69, or 33%, to $18.75, following yesterday afternoon’s surprise Q4 beat, and a better-than-expected rise in daily average users.THe stock has gotten at least five upgrades this morning, from Merrill Lynch, SunTrust, Susquehanna, JP Morgan, Evercore ISI, and RBC Capital.RBC’s Mark Mahaney, raising his rating to Outperform from Sector Perform, and raising his price target to $21 from $15, writes that this is the “reacceleration and inflection” that he thought might come later this year. He thinks it’s sustainable, thanks to an improvement in the Android version of the app, the transition of Snap’s ad business to an auction model, and the company slowing its employee growth, keeping operating expenses in check.The enthusiasm is spreading to other parts of social media. Twitter (TWTR) shares are up $1.10, or 4.3%, at $26.34, after Deutsche Bank’s Lloyd Walmsley raised his price target on the shares to $22 from $18, while reiterating a Hold rating, writing that he’s hearing improved feedback from ad buyers, and seeing better user trends in comScore data. Earnings results mostly gainers Among other earnings gainers this morning, Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is up $3.27, or 5%, at $66.94, after yesterday afternoon’s Q4 beat and higher Q1 forecast. Ultimate Software (ULTI) and Zendesk (ZEN) are both up sharply today, 7% and 8%, respectively, after yesterday afternoon’s reports prompt multiple price-target increases.Another winner is Match Group (MTCH), makers of the “Tinder” dating app, as well as Match.com. Its shares are up $2.71, or 8%, at $35.97, after it reported Q4 revenue and Ebitda beat expectations, and it forecast revenue for this quarter above consensus, at $380 million to $390 million, versus the average estimate for $365 million. New Relic (NEWR) is building on yesterday’s gains, up $3.83, or 7%, at $63.13, and for a moment up 9%, after the company beat fiscal Q3 revenue expectations and delivered its first quarterly profit, a surprise for the Street, and forecast this quarter’s results higher as well, sending its stock higher in late trading.Among this morning’s reports, Cognizant Software Technologies (CTSH) is up $4.81, or 6.5%, at $78.71, after the company reported Q4  revenue just a hair above consensus, at $3.83 billion, and beat by 7 cents on the bottom line. The forecast for this quarter is also higher, for both revenue and profit. Cognizant said it will buy back $1.2 billion of its shares this year.Among the losers is Microchip Technology (MCHP), after yesterday blaming its Atmel business for warping its March-quarter outlook.There are several bulls stepping up to defend the stock, but SunTrust Robinson Humphrey’s William Stein, reiterating a Hold rating, writes that it confirms a more abrupt industry-wide slowdown is at hand - as we warned in Dec. Goldman wants to fund your iPhone  Goldman Sachs (GS) is looking to expand its consumer banking effort by financing purchases of Apple (AAPL) gear, according to an article this morning by Peter Rudegeair and Liz Hoffman in The Wall Street Journal, citing multiple unnamed sources. Purchasers of an iPhone, for example, could get a loan from Goldman instead of putting it on a credit card. The talks between the two companies for the effort are ongoing and “could still fall apart,” the authors write.

1,"What a difference a dividend cut makes. In a much-anticipated move,            General Electric      (ticker: GE) announced on Nov. 13 before the market opened that it was halving its quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share.In a follow-up call, GE Chairman and Chief Executive John L. Flannery, a 30-year company man and its head for about 100 days, admitted somewhat clumsily that those days “didn’t go maybe exactly the way I was expecting.” The dividend cut was “an extremely painful action for our shareholders.”Flannery’s task was a bit easier than his predecessor’s. Jeff Immelt in February 2009 cut the quarterly dividend by two-thirds as the company coped with the global economic crisis, the first reduction since 1938.It is probably the last of Immelt’s actions that Flannery wants to replicate. After all, GE shares were perennial underperformers in Immelt’s 16-year run.Flannery was willing to get back to basics on the conference call, and early in his remarks even questioned GE’s raison d’etre by asking, “Why do we exist?” Should the head of a 125-year-old company be asking such things?If you were a GE director, that wasn’t the most unnerving thing Flannery said. The CEO also noted that half the current board would be leaving; currently there are 18 directors and the roundtable will be reduced to 12 seats, and three directors will be new.In the days after the call, directors have stepped up to buy stock on the open market.            Qualcomm      (QCOM) CEO Steven M. Mollenkopf, an independent GE director, chipped in $100,000 to buy 5,500 GE shares on Nov. 16. Mollenkopf has only been on the board for a year, so his relatively smaller buy is understandable.A fellow tech executive and independent GE director, Francisco D’Souza, CEO of            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH), paid $1 million for 55,000 shares on Nov. 20. It was his first buy of GE shares since April 2015 when he paid $1 million for 36,500 shares.Flannery himself paid $1.1 million for 60,000 more GE shares on Nov. 15 for his personal account, following his August purchase of $2.7 million in shares for his 401(k) plan. On Nov. 13, the same day of the call, even GE itself disclosed an investment position in its stock for the quarter ended Sept. 30. The 142,000-share holding is GE’s first quarter-end investment in itself (not counting treasury shares) since the third quarter of 2006, according to S&P Capital IQ.An industrial-strength buy dropped on Nov. 22 when            Loews      (L) President and CEO James Tisch disclosed that the previous day  Loews paid $54 million for three million GE shares. Tisch is a beneficial owner of those shares because of his status as a GE director.Tisch’s investment is the one GE buy that is clearly out of the realm of being a mere gesture. Does that huge buy mean the shares bottomed? Who was more bullish on GE, Tisch or Robert Gendelman, Loews’ senior portfolio manager and head of equity investments. We can’t imagine that the two men didn’t at least touch base ahead of the buy.Nonetheless, Loews’ larger recent trades bear some examination in order to glimpse its acumen and put that latest transaction in context. As of Sept. 30, the investment portfolio of equities reportable to the Securities and Exchange Commission totaled about $2.5 billion when excluding shares of Loews’ publicly traded subsidiaries, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners (BWP),            CNA Financial      (CNA) and            Diamond Offshore Drilling      (DO). One striking thing about the portfolio is that it seems almost tech-averse.          Alphabet      (GOOG) is the only FANG stock held by Loews, and even that at only 550 shares seems to be included by an oversight. On the other hand, the industrial, health-care and energy sectors are represented well. General Electric fits right in. Loews’ disclosed a second-quarter $20.1 million investment in            CVS Health      (CVS), 250,000 shares. The position was trimmed to 230,000 by the end of the third quarter. Unfortunately, autumn seemed to mark an unhealthy fall in CVS; the shares are down 8.4% since June 30, excluding dividends.The company disclosed a 702,000-share position in            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ) for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2015, valued at $65.5 million. From there, Loews reduced the position until by the end of the first quarter of this year, it was gone from the portfolio. The shares were sold into strength--J&J surged 39% to March 31 from Sept. 30, 2015, excluding dividends.At the end of the third quarter of 2014, Loews disclosed it owned 610,000 class A shares of          Liberty Interactive QVC Group      (QVCA). The holdings were eventually reduced to nothing by June 30, 2017. The stock didn’t reflect quality or value, as it didn’t fluctuate much and surprisingly ended unchanged over that period.One position is almost a decade old. Loews said it held 242,000 shares of            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) on Dec. 31, 2008, and while its ownership has fluctuated since, the name has been a portfolio mainstay. As of Sept. 30, Loews owned 550,000 shares. Through Tuesday’s close, Cisco is up 180% from the end of 2008, which predates Loews portfolio manager Gendelman’s appointment by four years.At the end of the second quarter, Loews disclosed it owned 45,000 shares of            Allergan      (AGN), a little more than a year after a planned merger with            Pfizer      (PFE) was terminated. Loews raised that investment to 56,500 shares at the end of the third quarter as the stock sagged. Allergan continued to slip, however; shares are down 29% through Tuesday since June 30.Hertz Global Holdings      (HTZ) is another investment that has been nearly break-even for Loews, so far. Loews said it held 1.3 million Hertz shares on March 31. Since then, the stock went on a late-spring swoon and then rallied through the summer before turning into a pumpkin in time for Halloween. Still, Loews has managed to get a thin piece of the pie with a 5% gain.In the Loews 2016 annual report, management including James Tisch admitted that the company goofed. “We could have repurchased more of our shares early in the year, when Loews stock was trading at lower prices and the S&P 500 was well below its recent levels,” Loews management wrote. “Alas, it must be time to get a new crystal ball!”However, another instrument was found to align Loews’ interests with the market. Loews disclosed a new position of 135,000 shares of the            SPDR S&P 500      (SPY) exchange-traded fund as of the end of 2016. The holding was trimmed slightly, but Loews still owned 125,000 shares of the ETF on Sept. 30; the shares are up 19% year-to-date.Loews has shown it can be patient with investments (a necessary trait for GE investors) while also being unafraid to close out positions. The singular ETF investment, valued at $31.4 million on Sept. 30, may indicate things to come.Oddly, Tisch himself seemed to misfire on a recent transaction...and with GE shares. On Aug. 22, a trust he controls bought 100,000 shares for about $2.5 million, or $24.56 each. Through Tuesday’s close, those shares have lost a quarter of their value. The shares Loews purchased have edged up 3%.Comments?

0,"Apple’s      warning Monday that it will miss March-quarter guidance due to coronavirus-related supply-chain and sales issues in China raises an obvious question: What other companies are vulnerable to the same conditions?On the supply side, there are obvious implications for anyone that sources hardware from China-based contract manufacturers, which includes most companies that make personal computers, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics goods. It also affects any company that typically sources, manufactures, and distributes parts made in China—and there will be second-order effects for companies that make parts in other places, as the entire supply chain slows. (If Apple can’t make iPhones, then all of their suppliers suffer the consequences.)On the demand side, the primary effect is the one Apple (ticker: AAPL) cited—China retail sales are at a standstill. But there could also be secondary effects as a shortage of products hits retail shelves in other markets.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi points out in a research note Tuesday that among the U.S. hardware companies he follows, the most exposed are PC makers            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ). He estimates that Dell has 20%-35% exposure to the China market on the supply side, with high-single-digit revenue exposure. The vulnerability is higher at HP, which sources more than half of its hardware, and generates about 10% of revenue, in China.Exposure is more limited for server manufacturers. Sacconaghi estimates            Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s      (HPE) China exposure at 3%-5% on the revenue side and 5%-10% on the manufacturing side. He puts            IBM’s      (IBM) exposure at under 5% for both revenue and manufacturing. More exposed is            Tesla      (TSLA), with an estimated 20% exposure to both the supply and demand sides of the market.In a research note this morning, Citi analyst Jim Suva provides a lengthy list of companies ranked by China revenue exposure, including glassmaker            Corning      (GLW), which gets about a quarter of its revenues from China and operates a glassmaking facility in Wuhan. There are implications here for the electronics distributors            Arrow Electronics      (ARW), at 20% revenue exposure, and            Avnet      (AVT), at 15%.  Barron’s reached out to a number of companies with potential China exposure for comments. The bottom line is that none are quite ready to quantify the impact on financial results, but neither are they ignoring the issue.Shares of Apple, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Avnet, Arrow, and Dell all closed modestly lower on Tuesday. The        S&P 500      was down 0.6%.  Write to Eric J.

1,"Matt Brill knows how bad bond markets can get. In 2005 he started as a portfolio manager in ING’s commercial mortgage-backed securities and investment-grade credit divisions. It was part of the insurer’s structured credit group, which included asset-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations. That placed him at ground zero of the global financial crisis, which started in structured credit in 2007 before spreading in 2008.“I joke that I’m 40 years old, but in terms of bond years, I’m probably 50,” says Brill, who has an economics degree from Washington and Lee University.The crisis also drilled into him that capital preservation is paramount. That don’t-lose-money mindset shaped how Brill now actively manages the $4.5 billion        Invesco Core Plus Bond      fund (ticker: ACPSX). In 2013, the Atlanta-based Brill—along with his former ING colleague and now co-manager Michael Hyman—joined            Invesco.      The two have worked together since 2005 and have a “seamless” interaction, Brill says. He’s the day-to-day overseer, while Hyman takes a big-picture perspective.The partnership has served the four-star, Morningstar-bronze medalist fund well. Core Plus Bonds 11.3% total return in 2019 bested 95% of its competitors and beat its benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. The fund has consistently outperformed its peers and index over the past three, five, and 10 years, too. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.75%—below average for its category—and an SEC yield of 2.39%. Its A shares carry a 4.25% load.Brill seeks high-quality bonds across asset classes, working with Invesco’s fixed income teams to identify opportunities and risks. He has a daily call with global macro teams and a weekly investment strategy team meeting. Twice a year, the teams gather with key investors. These sessions help build camaraderie, making it easier to ask questions and challenge one another, he says. He uses a three-dimensional approach to picking bonds, considering credit, capital structure, and duration. When looking at credit, he’s interested in the nuances of the bond, rather than simply picking a credit level. One holding that illustrates this approach is unsecured bonds from            Delta Air Lines      (DAL). Delta is a higher-quality credit because of its efforts to reach investment grade, such as cost-cutting and labor negotiation efforts, Brill says. Airlines are the second-largest industry in the fund, which also owns investment-grade secured bonds from            American Airlines      (AA). These securities are backed by individual planes, which can be sold if necessary. The “plus” in the fund’s name can come from numerous sources, with high-yield debt being the most obvious for additional returns. As much as 20% of the fund can be in high-yield bonds, but currently only 12.5% of its holdings are below investment grade. Brill errs on the side of quality, even for high-yield debt. His position in junk-rated            Ford      Motor Credit is one example. “We like that Ford has a lot of liquidity, with over $30 billion in cash. We liked the extra yield you get to buy Ford,” he says. Most of the bonds mature in three years or less.The fund is tilted heavily toward corporate bonds, at 44% of holdings, compared with a category average of 27.5%. It is the reason the fund performed so well in 2019, Brill says. (But it’s also why the fund had a rough 2018, when its corporate exposure was at 55% and the fund’s negative 2.7% return placed it in the bottom 1% of its category.)The fund made a big push into triple-B corporates starting in the fourth quarter of 2018. At the time, the market was fretting about companies’ debt-heavy balance sheets, sending equities prices sliding. But Brill saw an opportunity as several companies started to reduce debt to shore up their stocks. He knew his bet on higher-yielding corporates would work when the Federal Reserve pivoted away from raising interest rates in early 2019—but he didn’t expect it to work that well. “It was never intended to be a home run,” he says. “We were incentivized because the valuations were so attractive.” One such purchase was            AT&T’s      30-year bond at a 5.15% yield, a top-10 holding. Brill liked that executive compensation was tied to debt reduction and the telecom was aggressively discussing deleveraging. “We wanted to go and buy the longest possible bond in AT&T to participate in that deleveraging for a number of years,” he says.Note: Top industries as of Dec. 31. Returns through Jan. 24th; three- and five-year returns are annualizedSources: Morningstar; Invesco; BloombergAccording to Brill, people buy bond funds for certain characteristics, such as preservation of capital, income, and to protect from stock market risks. He tries to balance liquidity, credit risk, and duration—a bond’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates—to achieve those ends.The fund’s effective duration is 5.98 years, which Brill says helps the fund be a hedge against equities. That means it should gain or lose 5.98% for every one percentage-point move in the opposite direction in yield. When he adds more credit risk to the portfolio, he adds duration to offset it during volatile times. Brill isn’t afraid of duration, like some bond buyers. He believes inflation will stay low because of technological advances, and that an aging population will still want fixed income. That’s why Brill is comfortable owning certain long-maturity corporate bonds, such as 60-year investment-grade bonds from            Corning      (GLW), best-known for specialized glass. That’s double the maturity of most long-dated bonds, making Corning’s offer of bonds maturing in 2079 “uncharted territory,” he says. It is hard to forecast whether companies will be around in five years, let alone 60, but Corning was founded in 1851, Brill says. Part of what makes Corning and AT&T especially attractive is they are very liquid securities, Brill says, which means they should be easy to trade, even during times of market stress. That is a plus for Brill, who is always looking for opportunities to buy or sell—the fund has a 250% turnover rate. “Everyone focuses on maturity, but if I sell a bond today, it’s matured in our portfolio as far as I’m concerned,” he says.

0,"Corning      stock is falling for a second straight session after several analysts downgraded the stock following its third-quarter earnings report and outlook, released on Tuesday. Shares were down on Wednesday morning after falling 1.1% the day before.The specialty-glass maker beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines for the third quarter, but it had a low bar to hurdle. Corning (ticker: GLW) warned last month that it was seeing lower-than-expected demand for its television display glass and fiber-optic cable products as some customers reduced their spending, and took down its previous guidance for the third quarter. That announcement had sent shares down over 6% on Sept. 17.Looking ahead, Corning management sees a return to slight growth in its display segment—which accounts for 27% of its sales—in the first half of next year, but for its optical communications unit—34% of revenue—to remain challenged. Management sees a reduction in capital expenditures from big telecom customers.“Carriers are now cutting back on ‘additional’ fiber investment until they have increased visibility on 5G demand, which won’t be available until later in 2020 when services are rolled out,” wrote Susquehanna Financial analyst Mehdi Hosseini in a report on Tuesday. “Commentary from the likes of            AT&T      T suggest there is enough fiber already in the ground for the initial rollout of 5G services. We also don’t expect significant capacity additions among the Datacenters.”Hosseini maintained his Neutral rating on Corning shares and lowered his earnings and revenue estimates for 2019 and 2020. He cut his price target to $25, from $26. That’s about 17% below Corning stock’s recent level.Corning management blamed macro uncertainty for TV manufacturers being increasingly conservative and cutting back on orders in the third quarter.“A lack of clarity around Corning’s Optical and Display businesses has us moving to a Hold rating from Buy,” wrote Deutsche Bank Securities analyst Brian Yun in a report on Wednesday. “We think it is prudent to err on the side of caution and wait on the sidelines until we gather further information on the outlook of passive optical market and see a resolution of Corning’s Display supply chain issues.”Yun lowered his target price for Corning stock to $30, from $33.In the third quarter, Corning’s gross margin fell to 38.9%—a multiyear low. That also has some analysts concerned, especially given the lack of clear visibility on revenue in the company’s largest segments and continuing investments required for new products in development.Yun is bullish on Corning’s long-term opportunity in new business lines in automotive interior glass and pharmaceutical glass packaging, and for its Gorilla glass product to see increased value per device for smartphones and growth in wearables and other devices.Corning shares trade for 16.2 times next year’s earnings estimates. They are relatively flat this year, returning about 2%, including dividends, through Tuesday’s close. That compares with a 23% return for the        S&P 500      in the same period.Wall Street analysts are less than enthusiastic about the stock: Thirty-six percent have a Buy or equivalent rating, while 84% recommend a Hold. No analysts rate Corning a Sell. Their average price target is $30.80, less than 2% above Tuesday’s closing level of $30.26. Corning stock’s dividend yield is currently 2.7%.Corning stock was down 1.6%, to $29.79, in recent trading. The S&P was down 0.1%.

1,"Investors seem to be getting nervous about the relatively new companies trying to disrupt the way Americans buy cars. Shares of            Carvana      (CVNA),            Cars.com      (CARS), TrueCar (TRUE), and            CarGurus      (CARG) all fell at least 4% on Wednesday. Their valuations are lofty compared with            AutoNation      (AN), the largest publicly held operator of old school car dealerships, and            CarMax      (CMX), a leader in used car sales.Early Wednesday, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association reported that new car registration in the European Union fell 8.4% in August, the worst one month performance since last December. Year to date, European car sales are down 3.2%. And the soft demand is showing up in some U.S., markets. Houston area car sales fell 16.7% in August, for instance, according to the Houston Chronicle.A strike by the United Auto Workers against General Motors (GM) is adding to the uncertainty. A long work stoppage could impact the supply of cars from the auto giant. Also on the list of worries is the Trump administration’s move to stop California from enforcing its own emissions standards, which are tougher than those set by the federal government.One investor who’s bearish on the group of online car stocks thinks Wednesday’s selloff was part of a move by some investors away from higher risk, more speculative businesses. Signs of uncertainty in auto sales just exacerbates the issue.Carvana, which specializes in the sale of used cars, has the largest market value of the online auto sellers, at $11.7 billion. The stock fell 4.3% on Wednesday, to $77.41—still more than five times the company’s 2017 IPO price of $15. CarGurus, the largest of the public companies focused on working with dealers to connect buyers and sellers, has a $3.7 billion market cap. It fell 5%, to $33.14. It was a similarly tough day for the competitors in dealer-connected sales: TrueCar fell 4.6%, to $3.77, and Cars.com slumped 6.3%, to $10.The selloff didn’t impact AutoNation shares, though. Its stock actually rose slightly on Wednesday, while CarMax was off less than 1%. Both companies with an old-school dealer based model are solidly profitable. Carvana, on the other hand, continues to generate significant losses, and has more than $700 million in long-term debt. AutoNation trades at about 0.2 times projected 2019 sales; Carvana trades at more than three times sales, and CarGurus trades at more than six times sales. A spokesman for CarGurus declined to comment on the stock slide; Carvana, TrueCar, and Cars.com did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Earlier this week, glassmaker            Corning      (GLW) cut its financial outlook on reduced sales of glass to television makers, who seem to be getting nervous about the health of the consumer economy. If Americans are feeling squeezed and planning to buy fewer TVs, car sales could also be pressured in the months ahead.  Write to Eric J.

0," Treading Water. The three major U.S. stock market indexes traded near their break-even points as oil prices dropped 5% after Monday’s price spike. Investors are waiting for a potential response from Saudi Arabia to Saturday’s attack on its oil infrastructure and the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates on Wednesday. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      is down 40 points, or 0.2%. The        S&P 500      and the        Nasdaq Composite      were both roughly flat. Midday Movers Teleflex      (ticker: TFX) gained 3.7% as Jefferies reiterated its bullish view on the medical-device manufacturer.

American Airlines Group      (AAL) gained 3.3% after oil prices fell, clawing back some of the ground it lost Monday.Corning      (GLW) dropped 8.3% after the company cut its third-quarter guidance, citing the drag from tariffs. Nordstrom      (JWN) fell 8.3% and            Macy’s      (M) lost 4.3% as retailers got hit by fears of higher gas prices and a pullback from their recent gains as investors plunged into value stocks.

All Rights ReservedCorning’s      growth plan has developed a new crack. The glassmaker’s shares are down 6.4%, to $28.18, on Tuesday after the company late Monday warned of weakness in two pieces of its business—television manufacturing and telecom infrastructure—for the September quarter.Corning (ticker: GLW) shares are down $1.98, or 6.4%, to $28.13.Corning said that several flat-panel manufacturing customers “have reduced utilization below anticipated levels in the current quarter.” As a result, Corning now sees display glass volumes in the third quarter down by a high-single digit percentage. For the full year, the company expects display glass volumes to be up slightly. The company added that retail demand continues to track its expectations.“Television set makers are purchasing panels more conservatively, apparently due to macro uncertainty, which is driving panel maker utilization reductions,” the company said. “Corning expects this supply chain adjustment to be temporary and panel maker utilization to increase in first-half 2020 over second-half 2019.”Corning also reduced expectations for its optical communications segment.“Several major carriers are further reducing capital spending on cable deployments and fiber-to-the-home projects,” the company said. “In addition, some enterprise customers have reduced their spending below anticipated levels.”Corning now expects third-quarter optical communications sales to decline by a low-teen percentage, versus prior expectations for a low single-digit decline. For the full year, Corning now sees optical communications sales down 3% to 5%, versus a previous forecast of a low-to-mid single digit increase. Corning expects both carrier and enterprise network sales to decline year-over-year in the second half.The company added that in response to the current environment it’s taking steps to lower costs, including capacity adjustments, reductions in operating expenses, and a slowdown in capital spending projects.On Tuesday, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee repeated his Neutral rating on the stock, cutting his price target to $30, from $33. He trimmed his Corning EPS estimates to $1.75 from $1.90 for 2019, and to $2 from $2.15 for 2020. In a research note, Chatterjee wrote that “with Corning pursuing a heavy pace of investments towards driving growth, investors have consistently been concerned relative to the impact of a volume slowdown in the end-markets and the firm’s ability to mitigate the impact on margins.” Today’s warning serves to underline that risk.Separately,            Apple      (AAPL) on Tuesday announced that it’s awarding $250 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to Corning, which makes the glass used in iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. Apple made a similar $200 million award to Corning in May 2017. Apple said the investments “support Corning’s research and development into state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment, and materials integral to delivery of next-generation consumer devices.” Write to Eric J.

1,"Hedge funds soured on technology stocks in the second quarter, and increased their exposure to potentially politically sensitive health-care stocks.Within 45 days of the end of each quarter, hedge funds must report their portfolios’ holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regulatory form known as a 13F. In a study published Tuesday evening, a team of            Goldman Sachs      analysts drew on those reports to assess the holdings of 835 hedge funds that managed $2.1 trillion as the third quarter began.While the        S&P 500      has returned over 18% since the start of the year, the average equity hedge fund has returned 9%—their best performance through August since 2009. A basket of hedge funds’ top 50 holdings did better, returning over 16%, but still lagged behind the market. Managers continued to double down on their best ideas. Goldman found that, on average, funds’ top 10 long positions accounted for 69% of their holdings, up from 57% 15 years ago.They’re also holding on to their positions longer. “In 2Q 2019, the average fund turned over 26% of distinct equity positions, a figure that typically registered between 35% and 40% per quarter during the last cycle,” wrote the Goldman analysts. Hedge funds reduced their relative positioning in information technology stocks in the second quarter and bought into health care. Compared with the Russell 3000 index of most U.S. stocks, hedge funds are most overweight health care, which represents 18% of their combined holdings, or almost 4.5 percentage points more than the index. Information technology is the most out-of-favor sector: At about 16% of hedge-fund holdings, it is almost 4.5 percentage points underweight to the index. Other overweights include energy, consumer discretionary, and communication services, while big underweights are financials and consumer staples.That’s been an unfortunate portfolio positioning this year, however. Tech stocks are the best performers in 2019, up 28%, while energy and health care have been the two worst-performing sectors year-to-date.The favorite new buys of hedge funds last quarter are headed by Invisalign makerAlign Technology      (ticker: ALGN) and enterprise IT giant            Cisco Systems      (CSCO). Other big new buys include            United Technologies      (UTX) and            Comcast      (CMCSA). The list of reduced positions is topped by            Corning      (GLW) and            Xilinx      (XLNX). Other top sells are            Chevron      (CVX) and             Alphabet      (GOOGL).On an individual company level, following the smart money has been a winning strategy over the past 15 years, according to Goldman. Since 2002, the stocks that saw the largest number of new hedge-fund investors in a quarter outperformed other stocks in their sector by an average of 0.59 percentage point in the following quarter. The Goldman team found the reverse holds true as well: Stocks with the largest decline in the number of hedge-fund owners in a quarter have underperformed their sector peers by 0.66 percentage point over the next quarter.Here are the top 10 new adds and most exited positions by hedge funds in the second quarter:Source: Goldman SachsSource: Goldman Sachs Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.comHedge funds soured on technology stocks in the second quarter, and increased their exposure to potentially politically sensitive health-care stocks.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Vanguard Group’s tough stance on directors serving on too many boards—sometimes called “overboarding”—has started to bite, says Don Bilson, head of event-driven research at Gordon Haskett. Vanguard, which wields immense power as one of the three largest operators of index funds, this year decided to vote against corporate executives running for two or more board seats at public companies outside of where they work. It will also vote against directors seeking more than four board seats at one time.Exhibit A:            Eaton      (ticker: ETN). At the April 24 annual meeting of the power-management company, board member Todd Bluedorn, who is the CEO of heating and cooling outfit            Lennox International      (LII), received just 55% of votes cast, versus 85% last year. Bluedorn is also on the board of            Texas Instruments      (TXN), in addition to serving on Lennox’s board as chairman.“This is way too close for comfort for a guy who is probably the most accomplished member of Eaton’s board,” says Bilson of the voting results. “This is a new development in corporate governance. For some directors this could be make or break. It’s a development that will crimp CEOs who want to build out their dance cards as they approach 65.” According to Bilson’s analysis, Vanguard owns 32 million shares of Eaton. Nearly 147 million votes were cast against Bluedorn.You could see more from the            TiVo      (TIVO) results, where Chairman Jim Meyer is also CEO of            Sirius XM Holdings      (SIRI) and serves a director at            Charter Communications      (CHTR). At the May 1 TiVo meeting, Meyer received 76 million votes in favor and almost 27 million against.Who else could this affect? Bilson ran a screen of the broad-market        Russell 3000 index      to see how many CEOs sit on more than one outside board. It includes Sandra Cochran, CEO of            Cracker Barrel Old Country Store      (CBRL), who also serves on the boards of            Dollar General      (DG) and            Lowe’s      (LOW), as well as the CEOs of            Abbott Laboratories      (ABT),            Marathon Petroleum      (MPC),            Hasbro      (HAS),            Western Digital      (WDC),            Tractor Supply      (TSCO),            Corning      (GLW), and            Kroger      (KR).Eaton, Lennox, TiVo, and Cracker Barrel didn’t respond to requests for comment.As a matter of policy, Vanguard declined to provide information about votes for specific companies. A Vanguard spokeswoman, in an email to Barron’s, says the firm “evolved” its guidelines “to help ensure company directors have enough capacity to focus on their responsibilities and continue to serve in the best interest of shareholders. The role of a company director has become increasingly complex and time-consuming and Vanguard expects company directors to be highly engaged, active members of a company’s board.”She said that at times, Vanguard might support an overboarded director if that person has committed to reducing their board commitments.To be sure, one kind of better governance might cause problems. For example, there are few female CEOs: Targeting Cracker Barrel’s Cochran might be counterproductive. “The counterargument is, Are we limiting the talent pool? Can it hinder other initiatives like board diversity?” asks Duncan Herrington, who heads the activism response and contested situations investment banking group at Raymond James.Overboarding has been an issue for some time. Vanguard’s rule goes a little farther by encompassing all named officers. Glass Lewis, a proxy advisory firm, recommends shareholders vote against a director who serves as an executive officer of any public company while serving on more than two public company boards and any other director who serves on more than five. ISS, another proxy advisory firm, offers similar recommendations. Last year,            BlackRock      (BLK)—the world’s largest asset manager—decided that CEOs should sit on only one public company board beside his or her own, while outside directors should sit on a maximum of four public boards. A third big index-fund investor,            State Street      (STT), is more generous than either Vanguard or BlackRock: It frowns on public-company CEOs who sit on more than three public company boards or directors who sit on more than six public company boards.That could change if more stringent requirements become a best practice, says Herrington. “We recognize that Board service today requires more time commitment than it has in the past, and we are trying to find a solution that sufficiently addresses the complexity in judging time availability of directors,” State Street said in an email to Barron’s. “We see this as the responsibility of the Nomination and Governance Committees to assess the capacity of individuals to fulfill their duties to the boards as part of the annual evaluation process. We will continue to monitor processes and disclosure in this area and will evaluate our guidelines annually.” Write to Leslie P. Norton at leslie.norton@barrons.comVanguard Group’s tough stance on directors serving on too many boards—sometimes called “overboarding”—has started to bite, says Don Bilson, head of event-driven research at Gordon Haskett.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0," Welcome to May: Asian and European stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning, but U.S. stock futures were higher after Apple released its earnings on Tuesday evening. Futures on the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      were up 0.2%,        S&P 500      futures rose 0.3% and        Nasdaq Composite      futures jumped 0.7%. In Tuesday’s Morning Movers, we (1) summarize the earnings news, (2) scan the skies for an investing edge and (3) check in with Wall Street analysts.  Earnings Watch: You know the drill by now as Barron’s continues to cover earnings season. More than 308 firms in the S&P 500 have disclosed their quarterly results. About 76% of companies reporting are beating Wall Street profit estimates. It’s a healthy level, but companies generally try to manage expectations so they can seem to do better than expected when their results come out. Profit growth is positive, if nothing special. Tuesday morning, when we reviewed the numbers, growth was 1.8%. Wednesday morning growth was down to 1.3%. That level of earnings growth won’t win any awards, but at least earnings aren’t declining as some people had feared. Apple      (ticker: AAPL) shares soared after the company reported better- than-expected earnings. Wednesday morning            CVS Health      (CVS) shares rose in premarket trading after the company beat Wall Street earnings estimates and raised its full-year forecast for profits by about a nickel, or 1%. That may not sound like much, but CVS stock trades for less than 9 times its earnings. Barron’srecommend CVS stock in a recent cover story.  Occidental’s Plane Was Where?  Barron’s recently interviewed event- driven analyst and longtime investor Don Bilson. Bilson looks for unique events that can move stock prices more than 10%. He noted the            Occidental Petroleum      (OXY) corporate jet was seen in Omaha over the weekend. Now we know why. Warren Buffett’s            Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK) purchased warrants in the oil producer to help fund Occidental’s bid for          Anadarko Petroleum      (APC). It appears that M&A in the oil patch is heating up.  Upgrades and Downgrades: Conventional analysts who cover stocks and industries—doing it a little differently from Bilson—upgraded and downgraded several stocks Wednesday morning.            Corning      (GLW) shares were upgraded to Buy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Apparently analyst Wamsi Mohan thinks a stock-price move Tuesday wasn’t warranted. The shares dropped 6% after Corning reported numbers that beat Wall Street earnings estimates. On the flip side,            C.H. Robinson Worldwide      (CHRW) shares were downgraded at UBS. It’s possible            UBS      is worried about competition in truck brokerage from            Amazon.com      (AMZN). C.H. Robinson reported better earnings than Wall Street expected Tuesday night.

1,"Corning      stock is down more than 6% after the company reported first-quarter numbers Tuesday morning. Shares are now up 5% year to date, far below the 14% gain in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      and the 21% year-to-date gain in the            Apple      suppliers tracked by Barron’s. Corning (ticker: GLW) actually reported sales and earnings a little better than Wall Street expected. So what’s the problem? As is often the case with earnings reports, it’s the outlook that does the damage. Corning cut its sales-growth forecast in its optical-communications segment—that is, fiber-optic cables—to 10%, down from the “low teens” provided by the company last quarter.  Read more: 5G Can’t Come Soon Enough for These Stocks Corning also supplies glass for a variety of            Apple      (AAPL) consumer devices, and its results are closely tracked by investors looking for clues into smartphone demand. And though tech investors can’t blame Apple for today’s decline, it still holds some import for them. The back story. Apple’s weak iPhone sales at the end of 2018 hurt not only Apple but also its suppliers, like Corning. The effects were felt up and down the supply chain, hurting even capital-equipment suppliers that sell machines to businesses that assemble smartphones.  What’s new. Network operators are slowing spending on everything, including 5G deployment. “Our 2019 optical communication sales outlook has been impacted by a major fiber to the home customer,” explained Chief Financial Officer Tony Tripeny on the earnings call.That means the sales-growth deceleration is likely due to            Verizon Communications      (VZ),            AT&T      (T), or            Sprint      (S). Corning derives more than 17% of its sales from the wireless telecom giants. Optical sales in the first quarter grew 20%. Investors don’t like it when sales growth slows more than expected.  Looking ahead. The results don’t look all that bad to Barron’s, but existing shareholders seem to disagree. It is not as if Corning shares are too expensive. The stock trades for about 16 times earnings, in line with historical averages. At least the problems don’t see to be iPhone-related. Lower capital spending would be a concern for the tech sector, which is relying on 5G to generate sales growth in coming years. Still, taking Corning’s management statements at face value, we’re mostly talking about timing. “Our customers, the world’s leading network cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning’s optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G, and data center networks,” said Tripeny. “We continue to outpace the competition and we’re very excited about the growth ahead of us.” Corning stock is at $31.66, down 6.2%, in early afternoon trading.

0,"The stock market’s reaction to Coronavirus has been mixed, with some companies that rely on China for customers or supplies falling by double-digits while others have barely shrugged.The virus is likely to reduce economic growth in the first quarter by 2 percentage points globally and 0.4-0.5 points in the U.S., according to            Goldman Sachs      strategists. But Goldman predicts that nearly all of that economic activity will be made up in the second and third quarters, so that there’s barely any net economic impact from the disease. For the full year, U.S. GDP could take a 0.1 to 0.2 point hit, reducing cumulative corporate earnings per share for        S&P 500       companies by 30 to 60 cents. Given that Goldman expects S&P earnings to hit $174 this year, 60 cents is basically chump change.So far, the virus has mostly been contained in China, with nearly 99% of the known cases being recorded there. There’s no guarantee that it won’t begin to spread more aggressively outside the country. For now, investors have mostly treated it like an isolated issue. In China, the death toll hit 910 on Monday morning, surpassing the SARS epidemic. But some analysts see signs that the economy could begin to rebound in February. In fact, some factories that had been shut down could get back to work this week, according to analyst Edward Moya at currency broker OANDA.“Foxconn got approval to resume production in Zhengzhou, the main production point for iPhone 11, with most of the other manufacturing giants all to be poised to back to work within the next couple of weeks,” Moya wrote in a report on Monday. “GM will resume Chinese production on February 15th,            Hyundai Motor      will resume their domestic production tomorrow, both            Sony       &             LG Display       resumed normal operations today, while            Tencent       asked workers to stay at home until February 21st.”That said, businesses had previously predicted they’d restart operations after the Lunar New Year only to be delayed, so these dates could always be pushed back.The Goldman strategists have identified stocks with outsize exposure to China that have fallen the most since investors started to worry about the outbreak. They include            Wynn Resorts      (ticker: WYNN), which makes most of its money in Macau, a gambling resort area in China.            Yum China      (YUMC), which operates KFC and Pizza Hut inside China, has also been hurt. And computer chip maker            Qorvo      (QRVO) makes nearly three quarters of its revenue in China.Other consumer stocks focused on growing sales in China have also been hurt. Both            Royal Caribbean      (RCL) and            Carnival       (CCL) cruise companies are down about 10% since late January.            Starbucks      (SBUX) has closed more than half of its stores in China. Airlines including            Delta       (DAL),            United Airlines      (UAL) and            American Airlines      (AAL) have canceled flights to and from the country. Of those, United has the most exposure to China. Its stock is down 10% this year.Still, the strategists don’t think investors should buy every stock that’s fallen in the hope that the virus will be contained. People should look in particular at cyclical and value stocks, they say. Companies that are growing their dividends have been trailing the market and could rebound on expectations that virus-related declines could reverse. Stocks with growing dividends that are likely to swing on market shifts include            Skyworks       (SWKS),            DXC Technology       (DXC),            Wynn Resorts       (WYNN),            Broadcom      (AVGO), and            Caterpillar      (CAT).

1,"U.S. stocks are set to open flat on Monday as investors digest the ongoing threat of the coronavirus. All the benchmark indexes closed at records last week before slipping on Friday as optimism over the virus subsided. Stock futures have fluctuated on Monday as investors work out what to make of the latest developments. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was set to open slightly lower as futures dipped, along with the        S&P 500      and the        Nasdaq.      Chinese officials reported 97 deaths on Sunday, a new daily record, diminishing hopes that the outbreak was stabilizing. However, a scientific model predicted the number of cases would peak in mid-to-late February.Companies, economists, analysts and investors have been trying to count the cost of the full impact of the virus as it continues to spread.Goldman Sachs analysts said the economic impact will be limited and investors should look to cyclical and value stocks. Goldman analysts said the virus would hit U.S. economic growth by up to 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter, but the drag would be recouped over the next two quarters and the global damage could be as low as 0.1 percentage points over the full year. “The impact of the lower global and U.S. economic activity on 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share will be limited,” Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David Kostin, said in a note.“Investors who believe the economic consequences of the coronavirus will be limited should increase exposure to cyclicals and value stocks,” they said.The bank’s sector-neutral dividend growth basket of 50 stocks has “declined sharply” alongside cyclicals and trades with depressed valuations.“If fears of global pandemic are allayed, the basket should outperform,” they added.The basket’s stocks set to outperform the most are semiconductor company            Skyworks,      IT services provider            DXC,      hotel and casino operator            Wynn Resorts,      technology company            Broadcom      and construction equipment manufacturer            Caterpillar,      the note said.Goldman analysts said barring a “significant change” in circumstances, the impact of coronavirus on U.S. equities would be focused on a select group of companies most exposed to China — including restaurant owner            Yum China      and component manufacturer            Qorvo.When it comes to sectors, airlines and gaming will be the most affected, due to travel restrictions and U.S. casinos operating in Macau — particularly as the Lunar New Year is the most lucrative time for gaming, they added.U.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Honeywell International      completed the spinout of            Resideo Technologies      earlier this week. This is—or was—the residential technology business of            Honeywell      that makes and distributes thermostats along with other home comfort and security solutions. Resideo employs 14,500 people and its products are in over 150 million homes. Its $4.5 billion in revenue represents only about 10% of            Honeywell’s      total, but $4.5 billion would make it the second largest building products company in the small-cap Russell 2000. Spun out assets are often scrutinized by value investors because they are subject to selling pressures unrelated to business fundamentals that can affect pricing and provide opportunities for investors. For instance, holders of            Honeywell      (HON) may have bought that stock for its aerospace and energy units or to meet their own large-capitalization portfolio mandate. They may not be interested in a building-products company or allowed to own small-cap stocks. That dynamic is already playing out in Resideo stock (REZI). Shares began trading in the middle of October on a when-issued basis. The high-water mark was $31 per share on limited volumes, which is over 50% higher than Wednesday’s $20.05 price. In fact, the stock is down nearly 28% from Friday on volume of over 40 million shares. That’s over one-third of the total outstanding stock of the newly public company.            Honeywell      investors, by comparison, have traded about 10 million shares—or less than 2% of its outstanding stock. That’s what selling pressure unrelated to fundamentals looks like. However, spinout selling isn’t the most exciting thing about Resideo stock. Resideo can be a way for investors to get exposure to the Internet of Things—which is the catchall term for all the connected devices popping up, ranging from            Amazon’s      Alexa to a remote home-security system than streams live video of your porch. Resideo already has 4.7 million connected customers and “hundreds of millions in recurring revenue,” CEO Mike Nefkens told Barron’s. Nefkens says of the company’s future: “We will connect the guts of the home and make it smart.”Nefkens isn’t a typical industrial CEO. He came from information-technology services company            DXC Technology      (DXC), not            Honeywell.      “(DXC) was about cost cutting, (Resideo) is about accelerating product cadence and innovating faster,” says Nefkens. He adds that “we’ll take care of the base business” and guides analysts to 4% revenue growth; in line with Resideo’s history inside            Honeywell.But Nefkens sees the potential for much more than that by leveraging the ‘internet of things’ trends, though he acknowledges that “it will take a couple of years to convince investors the growth is real.” He envisions a future where a housing contractor is more like a “home doctor” who makes pre-emptive house calls to keep systems running smoothly and maintenance free.Next year, Resideo should generate $610 million in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) on revenues of about $4.8 billion. That implies a 12.7% margin—better than a typical industrial company of similar size—which is one indication that the franchise is solid. But the new capital structure at Resideo is a little complicated. The company has to send a $140 million check each year to            Honeywell      for environmental remediation. “It’s nothing (Resideo) did, but part of the price we paid for independence,” says Nefkens. That amount is capped and will carry on for 25 years, but it’s tied to actual environmental spending at Honeywell, which means it could fall if remediation costs are lower than Honeywell anticipates. It’s tempting to play fun with numbers when thinking about the possible effect on valuation, but it’s probably simplest and safest just to evaluate Resideo as if that $140 million in cash never existed. That base case means Resideo is trading for 7.8 times Ebitda, which is a slight discount to other industrial companies in the Russell 2000. However, it looks as if Resideo could fetch 10 times Ebitda, which is where other building products companies traded before the October sell off. That would make Resideo shares worth about $29 per share, up 45% from current levels. That scenario doesn’t rely on a benefit from the internet of things. Even if Resideo turns out to be just a quality residential franchise it still appears to be trading at a discount to its fundamentals. If there is a higher growth tech-company embedded inside the thermostat business then that’s a bonus for investors.

0," Panic Time. Stocks traded lower throughout the session on Wednesday, with all three major indexes closing deeply in the red. The        S&P 500      slipped through its previous support level of 2,700 and wiped out 2018’s gains. The        Nasdaq Composite      officially entered correction territory, down 12% from its high. Concerns over trade, the Fed, new-home sales contributed to the drop. In today’s After the Bell, we……look at which sectors have the biggest breadth problem;…wonder whether buybacks can save the market;…and marvel at            Varian Medical Systems      (VAR) stock bucking a down day. The S&P 500 Is Falling, But Its Components Are Worse Off About 28% of S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter earnings so far, with the average growth rate standing at 20%. Although down from the 25% growth rate in the previous two quarters, it’s still the third-best since early 2011. But the market is not reacting well to the overall positives, dropping sharply as the future of semiconductor companies—once the market’s favorites—become worrisome. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average,      which is in the red for the year to date, was down 608.01 points, or 2.4%, to 24,583.42 on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 tumbled 84.59 points, or 3.1%, to 2656.10, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 329.14 points, or 4.4%, to 7108.40.One big concern many investors have is the market’s worsening breadth. Weighted by stock’s market capitalization, the S&P 500 is swayed by trading in the largest companies, which can mask movement among the index’s smaller companies.While the S&P 500 is 9.4% off its 52-week high, about 79% of its components have fallen more than 10% from their respective 52-week highs, and 47% are in bear markets with losses of 20% or more; 17% have set new 52-week lows.But things are particularly painful in one sector. According to Jason Goepfert from Sundial Capital Research, half of materials companies have sunk to new 52-week lows as of Tuesday, the worst among all sectors.The consumer-discretionary sector, where            Amazon.com      (AMZN) alone accounts for a weighting of over 20%, is a good example how the breadth problem can be hidden behind the glory of a few giants. While the sector itself appears to be the best performer over the past year with 15% growth, only one third of the stocks within that sector have actually reached that threshold. Amazon has gained a whopping 71% in the latest 12 months, but about 28% stocks in the sector are now sinking a new 52-week low. A resurgence in buybacks could provide a floor for the market. Earnings seasons typically see companies ramping up share-repurchase plans. Brian Reynolds of Canaccord Genuity writes in a Wednesday research report, “If companies announce enough buybacks, that volume may prompt the buyback desks to begin to put money to work.”Reynolds writes that there is typically a surge in buyback announcements starting at around the 24th of the first month in an earnings season. That day is today.“If the surge is near the upper end of the recent range, then it becomes more likely that stocks will recover to trend within a month or so,” Reynolds writes. “If the surge is disappointing, then stocks would be more likely to at least retest the recent lows, and it would likely take 3-4 months for stocks to recover to trend.” Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte estimates that net buybacks will slowly revert to the normal pace of $15 billion a week from next week on. The Hot Stock Varian Medical Systems rose to the top of the S&P 500, helped by its fourth-quarter earnings report.Varian gained $8.07, or 7.7%, to $112.40.The medical-devices maker earned $1.16 a share on revenue of $801.6 million. Analysts were looking for EPS of $1.20 on revenue of $766.26 million. For the full year, it sees EPS of $4.60 to $4.75 on revenue of $3.06 billion to $3.15 billion. Consensus calls for EPS of $4.76 on revenue of $3 billion.Barrington Research’s Michael Petusky reiterated an Outperform rating and raised his price target to $132 from $129, writing that “Varian reported a very solid fourth-quarter result.”Year to date, Varian is up 1.1%. The Biggest Loser DXC Technology      (DXC) slid to the bottom of the index after a report that the head of its Americas business, Karan Puri, left the company. DXC lost $14.31, or 16.3%, to $73.25.DXC issued a statement saying that it had no comment on the rumors, and EPS was trending toward the high end of its guidance range. The company has seen a number of executives leave recently, which made the report of Puri’s reported departure even more troubling. The shares were briefly halted this afternoon.Evercore ISI’s Rayna Kumar reiterated an Outperform rating and $125 price target on DXC, arguing that regardless of whether or not the report was true, the shares had fallen too sharply.Year to date, DXC is down 10.8% Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com Panic Time.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Shares of IT services behemoth DXC Technology (DXC) jumped to the top of the S&P 500 today after analysts applauded a complex three-way deal that mergers the company’s public sector operations with two Veritas Capital affiliates to form a separate, publicly-traded company.DXC’s stock price rose more than 4% to close at $91.20 a share. That makes it the biggest gaining stock in the index today.According to a statement released earlier today, DXC will merge the section of its business that handles government customers with Vencore Holding and KeyPoint Government Solutions.

1,"It has become so easy to make money in the stock market that the famous dart-throwing monkeys who have long beat human stockpickers have reportedly turned in their lanyards. In this era of low interest rates, anyone with an online trading account has a great chance at making money just by buying almost anything that moves. And incredibly, almost everyone gets to trade commission-free. Nothing, seemingly, can derail the bull—not even            Apple’s      (ticker: AAPL) recent warning that the coronavirus crisis in China would hurt future earnings. The        S&P 500      index remains near record highs. The semiconductor sector—which is a proxy for the economy because chips are in everything—is also at historic highs. Everything is so incredibly bullish that you could probably make loads of money just by rubbing your hands together and saying, “Abracadabra, give me some dosh.”The options market, which typically prices stocks as if the apocalypse started yesterday, is now pricing higher highs in the stock market. And in another reversal, call options are now generally more expensive than put options.Rather than bemoan this historic advance and tell you to hedge with inexpensive puts to protect gains, let’s focus on upside opportunities. Earnings season will soon end, and companies will begin hosting investor day, or analyst day, meetings. Many investors don’t know that these are legitimate trading opportunities because the events aren’t always advertised, and the Street tends to not make a big deal about them. But a            Goldman Sachs      study has found that the meetings consistently generate gains. Companies often offer greater details about operations, strategies, and financial outlooks at the meetings. The information is then reflected in analyst’s reports, and sometimes even in their earnings models and ratings. This creates a halo around the stock, and shares advance in expectation of a brighter future.Anyone who systematically bought calls on liquid U.S. stocks ahead of every investor day over the past 18 years had an average annual gain of 21% above costs, according to Goldman. So far this year, the strategy has returned 28%. The trading system is simple: Buy calls five days ahead of the event, and close calls one day after the event. John Marshall, a derivatives strategist at Goldman, recently told clients that the options market fails to sufficiently price the potential for volatility around these events. “Unlike earnings, which occur with a fixed quarterly frequency, analyst days can be held many years apart, making it difficult to employ a systematic trading strategy around these events. We believe this leads to relatively low option prices heading into the event, providing an edge to fundamental and generalist investors,” he wrote. Marshall advised his clients to focus on investor days as the next potential source of single stock volatility after earnings season. Option prices on single stocks have declined. One-month implied volatility on the average S&P 500 stock is at 22, down three points from January highs.Goldman told clients to focus on these investor day meetings:            Hasbro      (HAS) and            Mattel      (MAT) on Feb. 21;            Mimecast      (MIME) on Feb. 24;            Arconic      (ARNC),            Deluxe      (DLX), and            Freshpet      (FRPT) on Feb. 25;            Chevron      (CVX),            Keysight Technologies      (KEYS),            Lam Research      (LRCX), and            F5 Networks      (FFIV) on March 3;            Zendesk       (ZEN) and            Centene      (CNC) on March 4;            United Airlines      (UAL),            Exxon Mobil      (XOM), and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) on March 5;            Big Lots      (BIG) on March 9;            Alteryx       (AYX) and            Cerner      (CERN) on March 10;            Parker Hannifin      (PH) on March 12; and            Illinois Tool Works      (ITW) on March 13. Each of those 20 meetings is a major event-driven trading opportunity. If you’re interested, review the list, pick call options at, or just above, the underlying stock prices, and have at it. Do it for the monkeys.

1,"The fundamentals of the stock market don’t seem very appealing these days. Valuations are high, corporate earnings are flat (at best), and profitability is declining, albeit from a record level.Pricier stocks aren’t a good bet when profit margins are falling, according to Sean Darby, global equity strategist for Jefferies. And because the        S&P 500      index itself is expensive—and looks set to rise further—investors don’t have many obvious options for individual stocks to buy. Darby recommended two types of stocks in a Jan. 21 note to clients: “cash cows” and the so-called dogs of the index.By cash cows, Darby means companies with high cash flow compared to their market capitalization. Those firms have more capacity to buy back shares, which should support the companies’ valuations even if lackluster profit growth holds back the broader market’s gains, he wrote. Cash-rich companies often outperform and command pricey valuations. But focusing specifically on companies with high cash compared to their market capitalization reveals some better deals, Darby wrote. The list of those cash cows include some big-name companies, such as            Alphabet       (ticker: GOOGL),            Facebook      (FB), and            Twitter      (TWTR), which are trading close to the S&P 500’s valuation of 22 times earnings for the past 12 months. By Jefferies’ measure, Alphabet is trading at 22 times earnings, Facebook is trading at 20 times earnings, and Twitter’s multiple is 34. So they don’t exactly look cheap. But the list also includes auto, tech, and health-care companies that are cheaper than the broader index.            Ford Motor’s      (F) multiple is 7.1, for example, and            General Motors (GM)      is trading at 5.6 times its earnings for the past 12 months. Centene      (CNC) and            Regeneron Pharmaceuticals      (REGN) are trading at 13 and 15 times earnings, respectively. And            Cognizant Technology      (CTSH) and            F5 Networks      (FFIV) are trading at 15 and 13 times earnings.The 25 companies that fell furthest behind the broader index in 2019 could outperform as well, Darby wrote. That list of the laggards—sometimes called the “dogs” of the index—also includes F5 Networks. Nordstrom       (JWN),            Macy’s      (M),            Pfizer      (PFE), and            Walgreens Boots Alliance      (WBA) were among the other laggards, according to Jefferies. “It is quite plausible the ‘laggard’ rally has further to run,” said Darby. And “at a time when the S&P 500 is just shy of posting its largest ever rise without a 20% decline and the biggest bull run on record, laggards and companies with the largest potential share buybacks are still likely to perform well in 2020,” he wrote.

0,"Is enterprise-technology spending slowing down?In a cautious research note Tuesday morning on network equipment giant            Cisco Systems,Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal raises that question, citing a series of clues that have emerged in the latest round of tech-sector earnings reports.“Multiple datapoints emerging over the last several weeks have pointed to the looming risk of a macro slowdown, which would be a headwind to Cisco’s top line and earnings,” Kvaal writes. “During its last call, Cisco noted the resiliency of the global economy. More recent datapoints imply resilient may be too positive a descriptor for the current state of affairs.”He noted that Cisco (ticker: CSCO) competitor            F5 Networks      (FFIV) said on its June-quarter earnings call that the overall macro environment is less healthy that it was a year ago and that the company has seen multiple deals delayed or canceled. On that call, CEO François Locoh-Donou said that his company is seeing “specific areas of softness,” particularly in the United Kingdom and Germany. AT&T      (T), Kvaal adds, “cited softer business conditions and pull-ins of investments in light of the China trade uncertainty, even in spite of clearer visibility into a resolution over the last month.”Arrow Electronics      (ARW), a major electronics distributor, recently cut guidance, citing deteriorating demand in its global components business across all products and regions.IBM      (IBM) reported that it is seeing the IT industry spending priorities “shift from investment in growth to productivity and cost reduction,” Kvaal writes. IBM Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said on the company’s recent earnings call that “what we’re seeing on client buying behaviors is a slight shift more and more to productivity, to quick payback ROI.”And he notes Gartner estimates that total enterprise IT spending will slow to 3.5% growth in 2019, down from 4.4% in 2018 and 3.7% in 2017.Kvaal has a Neutral rating on Cisco shares, and actually raised his price target on the stock today to $53, from $50, reflecting “confidence” in the progress of the company’s switching business. But Kvaal notes that “macro concerns have yet to scratch Cisco.” He says the IT spending climate has deteriorated, and that FY 2019 order growth is likely to slow into 2020. His revenue forecast for next year calls for 2.6% sales growth, about a percentage point less than the consensus forecast.Cisco stock on Tuesday is trading down 0.3%, to $56.76. Write to Eric J.

1," Mixed Bag. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed in positive territory on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was under pressure from falling            Boeing      (BA) stock after more countries grounded the company’s 737 MAX jet following the deadly crash last Sunday. U.S.-China trade talk continues, and the latest Brexit deal was rejected by British lawmakers yet again. In today’s After the Bell, we...Two of the three major U.S. indexes closed higher on Tuesday, with the        Dow Jones Industrial Average,      dragged by Boeing’s continuous plunge, the exception. The Dow dropped 103.38 points, or 0.4%, to 25547.5, while the        S&P 500      has surged 7.05 points, or 0.3%, to 2783.3 and the        Nasdaq Composite      rose 27.46 points, or 0.4%, to 7585.52.Boeing stock fell another 6.2% Tuesday in the aftermath of the Sunday’s deadly Ethiopian Air accident. Several countries—including the U.K., Australia, and Singapore—have moved to ground the troubled 737 MAX jets, but the Federal Aviation Administration hasn’t yet. President Donald Trump weighed in, saying airplanes are becoming too complicated, and that “complexity creates danger.”Boeing’s fall is hitting U.S. airlines as well, driven by investors’ worry that people might be less willing to fly. The unease is contagious. While carriers that use 737 MAX-model aircraft, such as            Southwest Airlines      (LUV), was hit hard with a decline of 2.3%.            JetBlue Airways      (JBLU), which only flies Airbus and Embraer jets, also saw its shares finish lower, if just, on Tuesday.The market may be focusing on Boeing, but trade negotiations between the U.S. and China continue to intensify. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Tuesday he is talking regularly with his Chinese counterpart and hopes “we are in the final weeks”.On the other front, British lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit divorce deal for a second time Tuesday afternoon. The defeat—by 391 votes against to 242 in favor—will make a delay for the U.K.’s scheduled exit from the European Union on March 29 almost inevitable, which could further intensify the country’s political turmoil and business uncertainty.The market didn’t make much of this mishmash of news, and nor should it. Stocks care whether the economy is headed for a recession, or whether stocks are too expensive. While stock valuations are slightly above historical averages, it isn’t far enough to cause a bear market yet, according to Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. As for an economic downturn, as the Fed become more dovish this year, a policy mistake also seems to be fading away, although investors should continue to watch the inflation and whether the central bank is behind or ahead of the curve. The next major event will be likely be a recession, but Keon doesn’t think one is imminent.

1," Unstuck. Stocks were pushing ahead with small gains at noon on Thursday, after starting the day on a downbeat note. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was roughly flat at recent check, while the        S&P 500      and        Nasdaq Composite      were both edging up 0.2%. There wasn’t much in the way of news today, other than more corporate earnings, though investors are keeping a wary eye on trade, the government shutdown, and ongoing uncertainty about Brexit.

1,"Pivoting among tech companies is as common as politicians, actors, and athletes reinventing themselves. The reasoning: Change with the times or face irrelevance.More than a year ago, David Henshall, the newly-minted president and CEO of            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), hatched a plan for the company–known for virtual private networks–to radically transform its business by developing a hybrid-cloud solution to help businesses simplify information-technology environments and link their remote employees to corporate headquarters.Citrix made the switch because it saw a market opportunity to help companies deal with the major shortage of workers globally by delivering digital work spaces that allow people to work flexible schedules and even from home. There’s a premium on being more accommodating to the workforce. McKinsey Group forecasts a shortage of 95 million medium-to-high-skilled workers globally by 2020, and some 61% of C-suite executives believe access to developer talent is crucial to success, according to a Stripe and Harris Poll.“We want to help customers face the future of a mobile work force,” Henshall told Barron’s recently over the phone. “Companies want to embrace the cloud, but it takes a while to manage the past while embracing the future.”Henshall celebrated his one-year anniversary with third-quarter earnings last month that for the fifth consecutive quarter, exceeded Wall Street expectations–adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share and revenue of $732.5 million. Subscription-based revenue, a cornerstone of the three-year plan, jumped 37%, year-over-year, to $112 million. It now accounts for 15% of total revenue, versus 10% a year ago.The results pushed shares of the company up 2% the day after it announced results; it’s up nearly 20.5% for the year, compared with 1% for the S&P 500. In the past 12 months, Citrix has gained more than $2.5 billion in market value, to its current $14.4 billion.“We believe all the pieces are in place for this cloud transition to manifest along with increased market demand,” Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research report. Ives maintains a Neutral rating on Citrix with a $115 price target, which implies about 8.5% upside from the current price.It won’t be an overnight success–          Dell Technologies      ’ (DVMT) VMware and            F5 Networks      (FFIV) are among Citrix’s competitors–but Ives and others note recent Citrix customer wins in health care and banking. At least 10 cloud deals are worth more than $1 million.Henshall says Citrix is “well ahead” of its plan to double revenue by 2020, and subscription-based growth will pave the way. He told investors on the company’s recent earnings call, “We expect 2019 to be another year of progress against this journey. The most important variable will be our mix of subscriptions to perpetual bookings. This year, we are moving that mix up to about 40%. Next year we want to target 50% to 55%.” The company also updated its expectations for fiscal 2022, calling for more than $10 per share in free-cash-flow with 75% of new bookings coming from cloud subscriptions.Customers are fast buying in to Citrix’s SaaS strategy. One such customer, Formula 1 race team Aston Martin Red Bull Racing, uses Citrix to connect teams of mechanics and engineers at race sites all over the world with its headquarters in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, the day of the race to share and dissect thousands of pieces of data in real time. The souped-up cars, which are modified supercomputers on wheels, contain 150 data sensors that measure aerodynamics and other factors. “The parsing of data in real time can mean the difference between races won and lost,” PJ Hough, chief product officer at Citrix, told Barron’s over coffee.Pivoting among tech companies is as common as politicians, actors, and athletes reinventing themselves.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0," Three’s Company. The S&P 500 was poised to close at a new all-time high as a pending trilateral trade deal between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada to replace Nafta is putting wind in the market’s sails. September has been statistically the scariest month for investors, but stocks made it through without falling apart. In today’s Intraday Update, we… Stocks are screaming higher as the U.S. and Canada came to a dramatic, last-minute agreement on trade late Sunday night. President Donald Trump will discuss the revamped agreement this afternoon. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      gained more than 270 points or more than 1% to 26728.55, the        S&P 500      climbed 0.7% to 2933.95, and the        Nasdaq Composite      rallied 0.5% to 8088.19. Investors are breathing easy so far Monday, but trade fears are not entirely dispelled as tensions between the U.S. and China remain. But not everyone is worried. The U.S. has negotiating strength on its side, says Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. “The trilateral deal that purportedly will supplant Nafta should offer a reminder that it will be difficult for any of American’s biggest business partners, most notably China, to dig in their heels when negotiating,” he says. “The size of the U.S. economy and respective trade deficits gives Washington significant asymmetric leverage in their prevailing disputes.” If a little relief can take the stock market this far, we can only imagine what happens when other fears are put to rest. Trade, Trump, inflation and the Fed are keeping investors up at night, writes Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who surveyed investors. That’s no different than survey results in March and June, but the good news: Geopolitical tensions, war, currency and U.S. debt levels slipped in the fear and excitement ranking. Investors still expect a robust economy in the short-term, but they are concerned about the possibility of a recession in 2020 with nearly half of surveyed investors expecting one to begin in just a couple of years. That sentiment could be a drag on stocks in 2019, says Calvasina. But for now, what’s not to like?Campbell Soup      (CPB) is down 0.5% to $36.45 activist investor Third Point filed a definitive proxy statement to replace the entire board of directors.DaVita      (DVA) is up 3.8% to $74.35 after California’s governor vetoed a bill that would have capped Medicare payments for dialysis providers.Delphi Technologies      (DLPH) is down 1.4% to $30.91 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded it to Underperform.F5 Networks      (FFIV) is down 5.4% to $188.62 after Piper Jaffray downgraded it to Underweight. Honeywell International      (HON) is up 1.3% to $166.54, after hitting a new all-time high, following the completion of its spinoff of            Garrett Motion       (GTX) and the acquisition of warehouse automation firm Transnorm.—Teresa Rivas Three’s Company.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Shares of networking technology vendor F5 Networks (FFIV) are up $4.07, or almost 3%, at $146.20, in late trading, after the company this afternoon reportedfiscal Q1 revenue and profit hat topped analysts’ expectations, and forecast this quarter higher as well, with its chief executive, Francois Locoh-Donou, telling me the company has “turned the corner” in sales its products, after many quarters of declining growth.There’s a small controversy over the earnings beat, however, which was affected by U.S. tax reform. Alex Henderson with Needham & Co., in a note this evening, points out that the 24.6% non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter, a result of the tax law changes, was better than the 31.5% the company had projected.Without the benefit of the lower rate, earnings might have been $2.07 per share, he believes, only two cents better than the consensus $2.05, rather than the reported $2.26. Without the rate change, it would have been “a very slight beat,” and “an in-line kind of guide,” he claims.F5, for its part, responded through a spokesperson that with or without the tax benefit, the company came in “above the midpoint of guidance,” with revenue coming in above expectations, and gross profit being as expected.In a phone call following the report and the conference call, Locoh-Donou was kind enough to spend a few minutes talking with me about the report and outlook. It was a solid quarter with good execution,” he said.“We feel that we’ve turned the corner in product revenue growth,” he said, “and that’s reflected in our outlook for Q2, it gets better from here.” Sales of product, as distinct from services such as maintenance, declined by 5% in the quarter, following a 1.6% decline in the September quarter.Added Locoh-Donou, “the number of drivers of investments we’ve made, both in sales and go to market motion, but also product capabilities, that’s what gives us confidence that we have an opportunity to return to product growth.Beyond the quarter, I asked Locoh-Donou, who was appointed a year ago, about where he wants to take the company.He went into an extended disquisition about where F5 has been and where it’s headed: We started in load balancing in the late ‘90s, early 2000s, and we evolved significantly, starting in 2004, 2005, to being an ADC application delivery controller company. I want to take the company through what is the natural evolution in that, to the next phase, a multi-cloud application services company. What I mean is, three things. Number one, the identity of the company will still evolve around application fluency, around the digital transformation that we see. it is all about more and more applications. Applications are becoming one of the most important tangible assets a corporation can have, just like people and money. Applications are becoming a big asset, and they are proliferating everywhere. Our identity based on application fluency, and understanding how to make applications work better, is a huge ocean to surf on, that won’t change. On the other hand, the future of our company is about multi-cloud. It is about applications being distributed across public cloud, on-premise, hybrid cloud, so forth. The ability to deal with complexities of that is something where we are uniquely positioned — the security complexity, the performance, etc. That is the next phase, to extend our reach, to reach every application, anywhere. We will also extend our role, extend the breadth of what we offer. Today, we offer global traffic management and security, including SSL encryption and decryption, for example. You’re going to see from us the breadth of application services grow. We’ll be extending our role and our reach to reach every application, everywhere.  Shares of networking technology vendor F5 Networks (FFIV) are up $4.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"AffiniPay, a payments company, looks like it will continue to be backed by private equity.TA Associates has won an auction for the firm, five people familiar with the matter said. Barron’s reported in December that the business, which produces $30 million a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was up for sale. The company was expected to sell for 20 times Ebitda, Barron’s said in December. Raymond James was advising on the auction. Amy Porter founded AffiniPay in 2005. The Austin, Texas, company provides payments technology for specific industries such as law and accounting. It processes more than $6 billion annually for more than 60,000 users, including the Alabama State Bar, the Louisiana State Bar and the ASPCA. In June, Porter, who was AffiniPay’s CEO, became executive chairman. Tom West took over as CEO, a statement said at the time.Payments companies, which typically process transactions between merchants and customers, have emerged as one of the hottest sectors in financial technology. Last year saw several large payments transactions:            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) bought TSYS for $21.5 billion,            Fiserv      (FISV) acquired First Data for $22 billion, and            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) snapped up WorldPay in a $35 billion deal.            Mastercard      (MA) bought Nets for $3.19 billion in August.More recently,            Visa      (V) agreed in January to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion. Plaid isn’t a payments company but provides the technology to enable consumer payments.TA, of Boston, is a longtime investor in payments companies. The private-equity firm acquired BluePay, a payment processor for merchants, in 2013. Four years later, in 2017, it sold BluePay to First Data for $760 million. TA also invested in BillDesk, an Indian payments company, in 2012, and in Financial Information Technologies, which provides invoicing and electronic payments to alcoholic beverage retailers and distributors, in 2018. Last year, TA’s 13th flagship fund raised $8.5 billion. Great Hill, which sold its stake in AffiniPay, invested in the company in 2015. The private-equity firm recently acquired a majority of One Inc., an insurance payments provider,Barron’s reported Feb. 20. Great Hill is investing out of its seventh growth buyout fund, which closed on $2.5 billion in July. Great Hill, of Boston, invests in sectors including software, financial and health-care technology. The firm typically invests equity ranging from $40 million to $250 million per deal.

0,"Three months after            Envestnet’s      founder was killed in a car crash, the fintech software provider is facing questions about its future. Envestnet (Ticker: ENV), which provides financial- and wealth-management software to financial advisors, may be on the brink of going private, bankers said. Large private-equity firms, in particular, are said to be interested. The most likely buyers include            Blackstone       (BX),            KKR       (KKR), Hellman & Friedman, Silver Lake and            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS).            BlackRock       (BLK), which acquired 5% of Envestnet in 2018, could also be in play. “Everyone wants Envestnet but it’s very expensive,” one banker said. Based in Chicago, Envestnet has a near-$4 billion market cap. The company’s shares were up 0.1% to $74.54 Thursday afternoon. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was down 0.3%. “As a matter of corporate policy, we do not comment on rumor or speculation in the market,” an Envestnet spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions. Silver Lake and Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. Representatives for Blackstone, KKR, Fidelity and BlackRock couldn’t be reached for comment. Rumors of an Envestnet sale began surfacing after Jud Bergman, the company’s founder and CEO, died in a car crash in October, Barron’s reported. Envestnet named Bill Crager, co-founder and president, as its interim CEO. Crager is credited with doing a good job since assuming leadership of Envestnet. Envestnet has its roots in venture capital. Founded in 1999, the fintech collected $40 million in six rounds of funding from investors, including TCV, BlackRock and UpFront Ventures, according to business-information provider Crunchbase. It went public in 2010, raising $63 million in its initial public offering, according to PitchBook, a financial data and software company. Envestnet doesn’t seem like a company that would seek a buyout. Its stock has jumped nearly 24% since Oct. 4, when Envestnet announced Bergman’s death, it isn’t overly leveraged and it doesn’t need a turnaround. Peter Heckmann, a managing director and senior research analyst at DA Davidson, said Envestnet’s stock is valued at 17 to 18 times Ebitda, while its debt is moderate. Envestnet’s debt is about $600 million or 2.5 times debt-to-ebitda, which is expected to fall to 2.2 times by the end of year. “For these types of companies, investors are comfortable with debt getting up to three times,” Heckmann said. If it doesn’t sell, Envestnet might seek to sell a chunk of itself. The most probable candidate is Yodlee, which it acquired in 2015 for more than $600 million. Yodlee, based in Redwood City, Calif. is a data aggregator, much different from Envestnet’s core function as an outsourcer to financial advisors. More than 1,200 companies use Yodlee, including 15 of the top 20 large U.S. banks. A Yodlee sale became more likely this month when Visa agreed to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion, or nearly 50 times run-rate revenue. The two companies are somewhat similar. While Yodlee provides technology that helps consumers aggregate their credit-card statements, bank accounts and investment portfolios on one site, Plaid’s technology lets consumers connect their bank accounts to finance apps and transfer money. “Yodlee is kind of like Plaid but not really,” a second banker said. Envestnet is considering selling Yodlee in an attempt to secure Plaid’s “halo” effect, the second banker said.Yodlee, however, ran into trouble this month when three members of Congress claimed that the fintech might be selling personal data without proper consent, The Wall Street Journal reported. Banks and fintech apps use Yodlee to collect and analyze transaction data from a consumers’ bank, credit card and other financial accounts, Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) and Rep. Anna Eshoo (D., Calif.) said in a Jan. 17 letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Envestnet doesn’t tell consumers that it is collecting and selling a customer’s personal financial data. Instead, the company relies on its partners, many times the banks, to disclose this information in their terms and conditions or privacy policy, the letter said. The lawmakers called on the FTC to investigate whether Envestnet’s sale of personal data violates the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Journal said. Heckmann thinks the ruckus over Yodlee will “blow over.” Consumers must agree to let Yodlee use their data, he said. Plaid also has the same regulatory issue as Yodlee. “Not only did Visa get comfortable with Plaid but they were willing to pay a huge premium,” Heckmann said. How much could Yodlee sell for? The company is expected to generate about $200 million in 2019 revenue, which is seen rising to $218 million in 2020, Heckmann said. Strong fintechs are selling for 15 to 20 times revenue. Given Plaid’s high valuation, Yodlee may fetch $2 billion. Possible buyers include            Mastercard       (MA),            PayPal       (PYPL) and Ant Financial, a subsidiary of            Alibaba      (BABA). Still, Envestnet could opt out of either strategy and remain a public company. “They have a good plan, they’re executing on that plan and they have a good valuation in the market,” Heckmann said. A PayPal spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Mastercard and Ant couldn’t be reached for comment. A spokesman for Envestnet Yodlee said the company doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation.

0,"Expect fintech deals, particularly payments, to be a big part of the M&A market in 2020. Last year, three huge mergers—            Fiserv$22 billion acquisition of First Data,            Fidelity National Information Services’s$35 billion buy of WorldPay and            Global Payments      $21.5 billion combination with TSYS—consolidated the payments market. The transactions have already lead to further deal making as the companies look to shed duplicate divisions or old tech. For example, Fiserv in December agreed to sell a 60 percent stake in its investment services business to Motive Partners for about $510 million. Consolidation will likely spur banks in 2020 to hunt for deals, particularly payments companies. Banks have the scale, distribution and balance sheets to become buyers of fintechs this year, according to Mark Palmer and Andrew Harte, analysts with BTIG. The successful IPO of            Bill.com,      which rose more than 60 percent in its first day, may boost this trend, particularly in payments, Palmer and Harte said in a Jan. 2 note. Banks are natural buyers of fintechs but haven’t really taken part in M&A as of yet. That may change in 2020. Big U.S. banks are more likely to buy large financial services companies or payment processors with significant earnings and reasonable multiples, than high-growth disrupters like MoneyLion, Chime or Varo Money that are burning cash, said Steve McLaughlin, founder and CEO of FT Partners. “There is less of a likelihood that banks will buy a highflier due to high valuations and fear of a culture clash, unless some creative structuring can be put into the mix,” he said. Of course, there are always exceptions.            JPMorgan Chase      in July completed its $600 million buy of InstaMed, a health-care payments technology company. Deals like InstaMed are “few and far between,” said McLaughlin, whose FT Partners advised InstaMed on its sale to JP Morgan.There’s also            Bank of America,      which may be on the lookout for payments deals this year. In July, BofA said it was dissolving its joint venture with First Data that handled debit and credit card payments for merchants. BofA plans to build out its own merchant services business, which could include acquisitions. In 2020, look for private equity to remain a strong buyer and seller of fintech companies, particularly payments. Cash-rich strategics will also be searching for deals. Fleetcor and Wex may be acquirers in 2020, the BTIG analysts said. The two firms are seen scooping up smaller, venture-backed companies, the note said. They’re not the only ones. Potential takeout candidates include            ACI Worldwide,i3 Verticals,      and            Repay Holdings,      Palmer and Harte said. Affinipay, backed by Great Hill Partners, is on the block, Barron’s has reported. GTCR has also hired William Blair to handle inbound interest for Paya, the company formerly known as Sage Payment Solutions, PE Hub said. A spokeswoman for BofA declined to comment. Spokespeople for Fleetcor, Wex, ACI, i3 and Repay could not be reached for comment.

1,"More than 10 years after the financial crisis, the M&A market is on an upswing—and showing few signs of stopping. Expect another good year in 2020, when an improved economic environment and low interest rates are expected to keep the merger market humming along. Not everything is rosy. The number of global announced transactions in 2019 fell 3.7% to 34,482 as of Dec. 19, according to data from Dealogic, down from 35,976 in 2018. Those deals were valued at roughly $4 trillion, a 2.4% dip from last year’s $4.1 trillion.Still, it didn’t feel like a down year to many M&A participants. Christian Atwood, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, who advises on M&A and private equity transactions, said he was surprised that deal-making activity dropped. “We certainly didn’t feel that,” Atwood said. “Demand for our services was higher than ever, and based on what’s on my desk right now and in the pipeline, I have no reason to think 2020 will be any different.”The slight drop comes at the tail end of a five-year bull run for mergers. Global M&A volume has surpassed $3 trillion in volume each year since 2014, Dealogic said. “The last four years have been terrific,” said Brendan Ryan, a managing director and co-head of Raymond James’s technology and services group.The past year saw an increase in large deals. Many of these transactions, valued at more than $20 billion, were transformative. For example,            London Stock Exchange Group’s      (ticker: LSE.London) $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv is an attempt to create a data provider to rival Bloomberg. Or            United Technologies’      (UTX) $86 billion agreement to purchase            Raytheon      (RTN) that will produce a $100 billion defense behemoth. Then, there’s the trio of large payments deals that consolidated the fintech market:            Global Payments’      (GPN) $21.5 billion acquisition of TSYS,            Fiserv’s      (FISV) $22 billion purchase of First Data, and            Fidelity National Information Services’      (FIS) $35 billion buy of WorldPay. Technology, particularly software, remained the top sector for deals. Tech M&A produced 10,216 transactions in 2019, valued at $808 billion. Health care came in a distant second with 2,967 deals totaling $580 billion, Dealogic said. Fidelity’s acquisition of WorldPay weighed in as the largest tech deal, while            Bristol-Myers Squibb’s      (BMY) $99 billion buy, including debt, of Celgene was the biggest in the health-care sector.The surging M&A market means sellers can continue to command—and receive—sky-high valuations. Strong software and fintech companies can trade, in the middle market, for 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda), Raymond James’s Ryan said. This compares to 10 to 15 years ago, when the same companies would likely go for midteen multiples, he said.Banking and private-equity executives have been preparing for a crash since the U.S. began clawing out of the last recession in 2009. Yet there are few signs of a downturn. Barring any geopolitical problems with North Korea, Russia, or China, execs remain very positive about M&A in 2020. Many banking and private-equity executives expect a rush to market during the first half of 2020, as sellers seek to get their deals finished before the presidential election. Some think merger activity will begin slowing around September or October, while Ryan thinks a drop off could start in late summer.Not everyone agrees. Atwood, of Kirkland & Ellis, doesn’t think the market will slow down at all in 2020. The first half of the year will continue to be “red-hot” for M&A, he said.

0,"Square      shares, long seen as a red-hot growth play, plunged this year as investors worried that the expansion might be cooling off. Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Willi says they may be too concerned. He upgraded the payments company’s stock to Outperform late on Wednesday evening. Square shares were up almost 3% on Thursday morning, although not everyone on Wall Street is convinced. The stock (ticker: SQ) will rise because investors are too pessimistic about the company’s prospects, given that the fundamentals of its business are still strong and its valuation is improving, Willi wrote. Earlier this year, the shares were chugging higher, rising almost 45% ahead of Square’s second-quarter earnings release. But when the numbers came out, the gross volume of payments Square handled came in slightly below expectations and management offered disappointing guidance for third-quarter revenue. The shares fell sharply and are now up 6% in 2019. That negative sentiment is overdone and “most, if not all, concerns are already reflected in SQ’s share price and valuation,” Willi argued. He addressed three areas of concern: slower growth in gross payments volume, the third-quarter financial guidance, and delays in converting Square’s partnership and investment in ticketing service Eventbrite.The key worries that he lists as overblown are gross payments volume deceleration, no guidance raise after the second quarter and delays in fully realizing the financial benefit of Square’s partnership with the ticketing service Eventbrite.“Given Square’s size, it is only reasonable to assume gross payments volume growth will moderate; although the second quarter moderation was more than expected,” Willi wrote. He also expects the company to offer more information about the outlook after it completes the sale of the food-delivery startup Caviar to DoorDash. The $410 million deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.Eventually, he said, Eventbrite will help to stabilize growth in gross payments volume, and may even cause it to gain speed. Willi believes that sentiment among investors is about to shift, sending the stock higher again, but Evercore ISI’s Rayna Kumar is less upbeat. On Tuesday, she dug into new pricing terms Square disclosed, and reiterated her bearish take on the shares.The thrust of the company’s new pricing, Kumar notes, is an attempt to gain market share among larger merchants, where Square has been less strong than with smaller businesses.“At first glance, Square’s pricing change appears to be a price reduction,” she wrote. “In fact, Square appears to be raising prices for small merchants to fund a price cut for larger merchants.”While it makes sense for Square to try and expand market share in a category where it has been weak, there is a lot of competition for the business of larger merchants form companies like Stripe, Clover and            Shopify,      as well as traditional payments companies like            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) and the soon-to-be-combined            Global Payments      and TSYS.A bigger rival,            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM), is setting its sights on a chunk of Square’s business. America’s largest bank by assets is rolling out free same-day deposits for merchants on its WePay platform who have a Chase bank account.The bull case on Squares requires that the company not only gain ground in an area where it hasn’t had its greatest success, but also that it defend its market share from what appears to be a newly energized banking behemoth. That will be a difficult path.

0,"The payments M&A boom keeps rolling on, with            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) and          Total Systems Services      (TSS) announcing a merger of equals Tuesday morning.The all-stock deal values Total Systems Services, known as TSYS, at $119.86 per share, or a 20% premium to the company’s stock price before talks between the two companies were reported. Global Payments shareholders will own 52% of the new company, and TSYS shareholders will own 48%. The deal, which the companies expect to close by the fourth quarter of 2019, “creates the pre-eminent pure play payments technology company globally with extensive scale and really unmatched reach,” Global Payments CFO Cameron Bready told Barron’s on Tuesday. “That’s the fundamental industrial logic of putting the two companies together.”  Read our latest cover story: Big Tech Wanted to Dethrone Credit Cards. Why It Failed, and Who Wins Now. There have been two big payments deals already this year. In March,            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) agreed to a $34 billion deal for Worldpay (WP), and in January,            Fiserv      (FISV) bought          First Data      (FDC) for $22 billion.The flurry of recent transactions in the payments space is proof, Bready said, that “now more than ever, scale matters in our business.” Investors who had anticipated the next deal in the wave of payments industry consolidation helped push Global Payments stock up more than 49% and TSYS stock up 34% before the merger talks were first reported. What sets the planned combination of Global Payments and TSYS apart is that the newly created company will be a payments company, without adjacent businesses to distract the company’s strategy or siphon off investment dollars, Bready said.While cost cuts are “a part of any of deal of this nature,” Bready said incremental revenue growth is the driving factor behind the deal. The new company will, for instance, be able to sell more products and services to its more than 2 million small and medium business customers in the U.S., he said.Bready expects the combined company will grow annual revenue between the 9% and 11% that Global Payments has historically targeted and will aim for between 16% and 18% earnings growth.Bready expects that the new company expects its debt to be rated investment grade and that, Bready said, will allow its to invest more in new technology and further partnerships and acquisitions.

0,"AffiniPay, a payments company, looks like it will continue to be backed by private equity.TA Associates has won an auction for the firm, five people familiar with the matter said. Barron’s reported in December that the business, which produces $30 million a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was up for sale. The company was expected to sell for 20 times Ebitda, Barron’s said in December. Raymond James was advising on the auction. Amy Porter founded AffiniPay in 2005. The Austin, Texas, company provides payments technology for specific industries such as law and accounting. It processes more than $6 billion annually for more than 60,000 users, including the Alabama State Bar, the Louisiana State Bar and the ASPCA. In June, Porter, who was AffiniPay’s CEO, became executive chairman. Tom West took over as CEO, a statement said at the time.Payments companies, which typically process transactions between merchants and customers, have emerged as one of the hottest sectors in financial technology. Last year saw several large payments transactions:            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) bought TSYS for $21.5 billion,            Fiserv      (FISV) acquired First Data for $22 billion, and            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) snapped up WorldPay in a $35 billion deal.            Mastercard      (MA) bought Nets for $3.19 billion in August.More recently,            Visa      (V) agreed in January to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion. Plaid isn’t a payments company but provides the technology to enable consumer payments.TA, of Boston, is a longtime investor in payments companies. The private-equity firm acquired BluePay, a payment processor for merchants, in 2013. Four years later, in 2017, it sold BluePay to First Data for $760 million. TA also invested in BillDesk, an Indian payments company, in 2012, and in Financial Information Technologies, which provides invoicing and electronic payments to alcoholic beverage retailers and distributors, in 2018. Last year, TA’s 13th flagship fund raised $8.5 billion. Great Hill, which sold its stake in AffiniPay, invested in the company in 2015. The private-equity firm recently acquired a majority of One Inc., an insurance payments provider,Barron’s reported Feb. 20. Great Hill is investing out of its seventh growth buyout fund, which closed on $2.5 billion in July. Great Hill, of Boston, invests in sectors including software, financial and health-care technology. The firm typically invests equity ranging from $40 million to $250 million per deal.

1,"Expect fintech deals, particularly payments, to be a big part of the M&A market in 2020. Last year, three huge mergers—            Fiserv$22 billion acquisition of First Data,            Fidelity National Information Services’s$35 billion buy of WorldPay and            Global Payments      $21.5 billion combination with TSYS—consolidated the payments market. The transactions have already lead to further deal making as the companies look to shed duplicate divisions or old tech. For example, Fiserv in December agreed to sell a 60 percent stake in its investment services business to Motive Partners for about $510 million. Consolidation will likely spur banks in 2020 to hunt for deals, particularly payments companies. Banks have the scale, distribution and balance sheets to become buyers of fintechs this year, according to Mark Palmer and Andrew Harte, analysts with BTIG. The successful IPO of            Bill.com,      which rose more than 60 percent in its first day, may boost this trend, particularly in payments, Palmer and Harte said in a Jan. 2 note. Banks are natural buyers of fintechs but haven’t really taken part in M&A as of yet. That may change in 2020. Big U.S. banks are more likely to buy large financial services companies or payment processors with significant earnings and reasonable multiples, than high-growth disrupters like MoneyLion, Chime or Varo Money that are burning cash, said Steve McLaughlin, founder and CEO of FT Partners. “There is less of a likelihood that banks will buy a highflier due to high valuations and fear of a culture clash, unless some creative structuring can be put into the mix,” he said. Of course, there are always exceptions.            JPMorgan Chase      in July completed its $600 million buy of InstaMed, a health-care payments technology company. Deals like InstaMed are “few and far between,” said McLaughlin, whose FT Partners advised InstaMed on its sale to JP Morgan.There’s also            Bank of America,      which may be on the lookout for payments deals this year. In July, BofA said it was dissolving its joint venture with First Data that handled debit and credit card payments for merchants. BofA plans to build out its own merchant services business, which could include acquisitions. In 2020, look for private equity to remain a strong buyer and seller of fintech companies, particularly payments. Cash-rich strategics will also be searching for deals. Fleetcor and Wex may be acquirers in 2020, the BTIG analysts said. The two firms are seen scooping up smaller, venture-backed companies, the note said. They’re not the only ones. Potential takeout candidates include            ACI Worldwide,i3 Verticals,      and            Repay Holdings,      Palmer and Harte said. Affinipay, backed by Great Hill Partners, is on the block, Barron’s has reported. GTCR has also hired William Blair to handle inbound interest for Paya, the company formerly known as Sage Payment Solutions, PE Hub said. A spokeswoman for BofA declined to comment. Spokespeople for Fleetcor, Wex, ACI, i3 and Repay could not be reached for comment.

1,"More than 10 years after the financial crisis, the M&A market is on an upswing—and showing few signs of stopping. Expect another good year in 2020, when an improved economic environment and low interest rates are expected to keep the merger market humming along. Not everything is rosy. The number of global announced transactions in 2019 fell 3.7% to 34,482 as of Dec. 19, according to data from Dealogic, down from 35,976 in 2018. Those deals were valued at roughly $4 trillion, a 2.4% dip from last year’s $4.1 trillion.Still, it didn’t feel like a down year to many M&A participants. Christian Atwood, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, who advises on M&A and private equity transactions, said he was surprised that deal-making activity dropped. “We certainly didn’t feel that,” Atwood said. “Demand for our services was higher than ever, and based on what’s on my desk right now and in the pipeline, I have no reason to think 2020 will be any different.”The slight drop comes at the tail end of a five-year bull run for mergers. Global M&A volume has surpassed $3 trillion in volume each year since 2014, Dealogic said. “The last four years have been terrific,” said Brendan Ryan, a managing director and co-head of Raymond James’s technology and services group.The past year saw an increase in large deals. Many of these transactions, valued at more than $20 billion, were transformative. For example,            London Stock Exchange Group’s      (ticker: LSE.London) $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv is an attempt to create a data provider to rival Bloomberg. Or            United Technologies’      (UTX) $86 billion agreement to purchase            Raytheon      (RTN) that will produce a $100 billion defense behemoth. Then, there’s the trio of large payments deals that consolidated the fintech market:            Global Payments’      (GPN) $21.5 billion acquisition of TSYS,            Fiserv’s      (FISV) $22 billion purchase of First Data, and            Fidelity National Information Services’      (FIS) $35 billion buy of WorldPay. Technology, particularly software, remained the top sector for deals. Tech M&A produced 10,216 transactions in 2019, valued at $808 billion. Health care came in a distant second with 2,967 deals totaling $580 billion, Dealogic said. Fidelity’s acquisition of WorldPay weighed in as the largest tech deal, while            Bristol-Myers Squibb’s      (BMY) $99 billion buy, including debt, of Celgene was the biggest in the health-care sector.The surging M&A market means sellers can continue to command—and receive—sky-high valuations. Strong software and fintech companies can trade, in the middle market, for 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda), Raymond James’s Ryan said. This compares to 10 to 15 years ago, when the same companies would likely go for midteen multiples, he said.Banking and private-equity executives have been preparing for a crash since the U.S. began clawing out of the last recession in 2009. Yet there are few signs of a downturn. Barring any geopolitical problems with North Korea, Russia, or China, execs remain very positive about M&A in 2020. Many banking and private-equity executives expect a rush to market during the first half of 2020, as sellers seek to get their deals finished before the presidential election. Some think merger activity will begin slowing around September or October, while Ryan thinks a drop off could start in late summer.Not everyone agrees. Atwood, of Kirkland & Ellis, doesn’t think the market will slow down at all in 2020. The first half of the year will continue to be “red-hot” for M&A, he said. If President Donald Trump is reelected, then it’s “business as usual” for mergers, Atwood says. “If Trump is defeated, I think that could actually cause an acceleration in activity due to the risk that changes to the tax code could follow,” he said. Expect private-equity firms to be very active in 2020. Buyout firms have $1.4 trillion of cash that they need to put to work, Preqin says. This figure hits $2.4 trillion if Preqin includes real estate, infrastructure, natural resources and private debt, a spokeswoman said. The pressure to invest, combined with relatively easy financing, will spur private equity to hunt more in the public markets for deals. One example:            KKR’s      (KKR) reported interest in            Walgreens Boots Alliance      (WBA), which is valued at $70 billion. “PE is sitting on enormous dry powder,” Andrew Bednar, a senior partner at Perella Weinberg Partners, says. “People are waiting on that to get deployed and it will get deployed.”That could make 2020 a very happy year for M&A.

1,"U.S. stocks are poised to open higher on Thursday because of trade news. News reports say the U.S. and China agreed to roll back tariffs in stages.        Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures are up 0.6%,        S&P 500      stock-index futures are 0.4% higher, and        Nasdaq Composite      futures have risen 0.5%. Individual stocks are moving, too. First, the bad news. Roku      (ROKU) stock plunged almost 14% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The company reported a loss of 22 cents a share in the third quarter. That’s actually better than the 28-cent loss that Wall Street expected. Apparently, Roku needed to do even better to keep its stock momentum up. Shares have advanced more than 360% year to date and almost 40% over the past three months as of Wednesday’s closing price. Still, the news for Roku share holders isn’t all that bad in light of the year-to-date performance. That’s not the case for            Expedia      (EXPE). The travel company missed Wall Street earnings estimates and cut full-year earnings guidance Wednesday evening. Global geopolitical uncertainty and higher marketing costs are hitting results. Shares dropped more than 13% in after-hours trading. That drop will send full-year stock performance into single-digit territory on Thursday. Then some good news. Chesapeake Energy      (CHK) stock is up 2.6% in premarket trading. That’s cold comfort for investors. Shares dropped more than 29% on Wednesday as investors weigh the possibility of a debt death spiral. “If continued depressed energy prices persist, combined with the scheduled reductions in the leverage ratio covenant, our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant during the next 12 months will be adversely affected which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,” reads the company’s most recent financial filing from Tuesday. Thursday’s small bounce for shares isn’t all that great in light of the recent “going concern” language in company reports. Investors will be happier with            Qualcomm      (QCOM) and            Fiserv      (FISV). Both companies beat Wall Street quarterly earnings estimates reported after the close of trading Wednesday. And both shares are higher in premarket trading, up 6.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Qualcomm reported earnings of 78 cents a share, better than what Wall Street expected and higher than the 75 cents that was at the upper end of the guidance range the company provided investors earlier this year. Guidance for the coming quarter—at about 85 cents a share—was also a little better than Wall Street estimates. Fiserv earned $1.02 a share in the third quarter. Analysts expected 99 cents. The company also completed its acquisition of First Data in late July.

1,"Fiserv chose a good time to borrow. Monday brought a respite from trade-war tensions, so financial-technology company            Fiserv      (FISV) took advantage. It sold $9 billion of long-term U.S. bonds to strong demand, as part of a plan to refinance the debt of its acquisition target          First Data Corp      (FDC). Fiserv wasn’t alone. Eight other companies sold bonds on Monday, bringing the total issuance for the day above $17 billion. Bond investors could have an unusually busy June. Investment-grade companies have sold almost $41 billion of bonds in the first 10 days of the month, up 2.5% from the same period last year. Last June was unusually busy, too.Companies are borrowing more because they can. Investors are returning to the corporate-bond market, and a Treasury-market rally is pushing borrowing costs lower. Individual investors sent a net $52 billion of cash into investment-grade corporate bond funds this year, according to Lipper, after making net withdrawals of $23 billion in December.The renewed investor demand can probably be attributed to the increasingly prominent view that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. Futures markets are pricing in about 0.5 percentage points of rate cuts by the end of 2019.Companies have also been able to sell long-term debt, which reduces pressure on their balance sheets by extending the timeline for repayment. That’s because longer-term debt is most sensitive to interest rates, and rallies most when interest rates fall. All of the bonds sold on Monday had maturities of five years or longer.For example, more than half of Fiserv’s $9 billion worth of bonds mature in either 10 or 30 years. The company will likely sell an additional $3 billion of bonds to European and British investors this week. Its U.S. bond sale was more than three times oversubscribed on Monday. The bonds were sold in four tranches, which all sold with lower yields than underwriters initially expected after investors bid up the bonds’ prices.Fiserv’s $22 billon acquisition of First Data is an all-stock transaction. Those normally don’t involve borrowing, but Fiserv has a BBB rating, four tiers above First Data’s BB- rating. So the company is borrowing to refinance some of First Data’s debt, which totals about $16.3 billion, and reduce the combined company’s interest costs. The acquisition is expected to close later this year.

0,"The payments M&A boom keeps rolling on, with            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) and          Total Systems Services      (TSS) announcing a merger of equals Tuesday morning.The all-stock deal values Total Systems Services, known as TSYS, at $119.86 per share, or a 20% premium to the company’s stock price before talks between the two companies were reported. Global Payments shareholders will own 52% of the new company, and TSYS shareholders will own 48%. The deal, which the companies expect to close by the fourth quarter of 2019, “creates the pre-eminent pure play payments technology company globally with extensive scale and really unmatched reach,” Global Payments CFO Cameron Bready told Barron’s on Tuesday. “That’s the fundamental industrial logic of putting the two companies together.”  Read our latest cover story: Big Tech Wanted to Dethrone Credit Cards. Why It Failed, and Who Wins Now. There have been two big payments deals already this year. In March,            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) agreed to a $34 billion deal for Worldpay (WP), and in January,            Fiserv      (FISV) bought          First Data      (FDC) for $22 billion.The flurry of recent transactions in the payments space is proof, Bready said, that “now more than ever, scale matters in our business.” Investors who had anticipated the next deal in the wave of payments industry consolidation helped push Global Payments stock up more than 49% and TSYS stock up 34% before the merger talks were first reported. What sets the planned combination of Global Payments and TSYS apart is that the newly created company will be a payments company, without adjacent businesses to distract the company’s strategy or siphon off investment dollars, Bready said.While cost cuts are “a part of any of deal of this nature,” Bready said incremental revenue growth is the driving factor behind the deal. The new company will, for instance, be able to sell more products and services to its more than 2 million small and medium business customers in the U.S., he said.Bready expects the combined company will grow annual revenue between the 9% and 11% that Global Payments has historically targeted and will aim for between 16% and 18% earnings growth.Bready expects that the new company expects its debt to be rated investment grade and that, Bready said, will allow its to invest more in new technology and further partnerships and acquisitions.

1,"Senator David Perdue (R., Ga.) has been buying stock with relatively moderate gains so far in 2019 and selling stock that has been rocketing this year.A joint account that he owns with his wife Bonnie Perdue has been buying            FedEx      (ticker: FDX), class C            Alphabet      (GOOG), and            Booking Holdings      stock (BKNG) in March and April. The Perdues’ account has also been selling          First Data      (FDC) and            International Business Machines      stock (IBM). Perdue disclosed the transactions in a regulatory form he filed.Perdue’s Senate office said, “Senator Perdue’s assets are managed by an outside financial advisor who ensures transactions are publicly reported in a timely fashion as required by the Senate Ethics Committee.”FedEx stock is up 18% so far this year through Wednesday’s close. The Senator’s joint account bought $50,008 to $225,000 of the logistics giant’s shares from March 28 through April 5. Specific amounts aren’t required for disclosure, only ranges. This seems to be a new investment for the Perdues. A form the Senator filed for holdings at the end of 2017 showed no ownership of FedEx stock and records from 2018 and earlier in 2019 don’t show any transactions in FedEx.The joint account also bought $15,001 to $50,000 of class C Alphabet stock on March 25, and this also appears to be a new investment. The year-end disclosure for 2017 showed the Perdues owned $15,001 to $50,000 of class A Alphabet stock, which trades under the ticker GOOGL, but no class C stock. Class A shares each carry one vote and class C shares are nonvoting. Class C Alphabet stock is up 16% year to date.Booking Holdings is also a new investment for the Perdues’ account, which bought $15,001 to $50,000 of stock of the company formerly known as Priceline. Booking Holdings stock is up 5% so far in 2019.First Data stock has rocketed 52% so far in 2019. Most of the upside is from an agreement for            Fiserv      (FISV) to acquire the company in a transaction expected to be completed in the second half of the year. From March 7 through April 5, the Perdues’ account sold $19,005 to $110,000 of stock of First Data, which provides technology services to banks and other financial firms. The Senator had been selling First Data stock earlier this year, as well. The Senator’s joint account sold $15,001 to $50,000 of IBM stock on March 21. Strong fourth-quarter earnings and guidance in January set the tempo for the year, and since then IBM stock has continued to rise. It now sports a 26% gain so far this year.

1,"It’s not easy being an investor in some merger-and-acquisition deals.  Take Monday’s announcement of a big—$34 billion, plus $9 billion in debt—acquisition by            Fidelity National Information Services      (ticker: FIS), or FIS, of          Worldpay      (WP). Both are analyst picks; neither are household names. FIS is a $9.2 billion in revenue broad-based provider of digital-processing services between retail and financial services, including banks. Worldpay is a $3.9 billion major processor of merchant transactions—mobile, online, and in-store, with an emphasis on e-commerce. Both have emerged from a scrum of M&A transactions over the years. The payments-processing industry, which is layered, fragmented and global, has seen rapid growth and consolidation: In January            Fiserv      (FISV) said it was buying          First Data      (FDC) for $22 billion; Worldpay itself was acquired by          Vantiv      for $10.4 billion last year and took its name; and FIS has grown for years through M&A, including buying Sungard for $9 billion in 2015. Two things stand out: There’s a Mixmaster full of M&A here, intercut with private equity ownership. FIS and Worldpay presented this deal, with its modest 14% premium, as a consolidation play. Worldpay will provide FIS another service to sell to financial services customers with its big global footprint. “Scale matters in our rapidly changing industry,” the press release quotes FIS Chairman and CEO Gary Norcross. In fact, payments processing is a high-tech, fast-changing business that requires economies of scale to make money—huge commodity-like volumes—and generates lots of valuable data. There are regularly new entrants with new technologies. Security is important. And both the technology and the business are complex and goal oriented: fully integrated, global, frictionless, end-to-end processing for mostly retail payments. Those conditions—scale, integration, disruption, data—catalyze M&A. Think            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) and its M&A program. By most measures, FIS has done a good job on both operations and M&A: Earnings have been growing, it’s kept expenses down, and the company has successfully integrated acquisitions. True, its trailing-12-month return on equity of 16.7% lags the industry’s 20.3%. And shares have advanced 8.7% in the past year, compared with 12.8% for the industry, according to Zacks. FIS promises it will extract $400 million a year in synergies from the Worldpay deal, and boost organic growth to 9% from 6%. And the combined company will produce $15 billion in revenue and $7 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in three years, which would reduce the debt on the deal. That’s positive, if aspirational. Given all that, it’s disconcerting that FIS argues the strategic rationale of the deal on a blast of overheated marketing. “The deal brings together the No. 1 global fintech provider with the No. 1 acquirer and industry leader in e-commerce and integrated point of sales and one of the premier global payments companies...” Norcross said in the Monday conference call. “This brings together two great companies empowering financial institutions, capital markets and businesses in a new global community…Worldpay’s solutions set and client-focused nature is all very complementary to FIS…the size and scale of our combined community will allow us to accelerate the future of finance and commerce on a local basis, with the personalization needed to meet the rapidly evolving demands locally.”Got that? This deal may, in fact, work out; a number of analysts like it. But if you didn’t already know, would you guess what Worldpay actually does—and what it’s No. 1 at? Quick, parse the difference between fintech, e-commerce, global payments, and merchant payments? How do you judge solutions sets, global communities and client focus? Define personalization. And then there’s the accelerating future! Either Norcross is trying to obscure how these two companies fit together in a complicated jigsaw puzzle, or this is just how payment-processing folks talk. And this isn’t just FIS; it’s common on many M&A calls, which are essentially pitch sessions to investors, with giddy analysts offering congrats. It makes for a deal that’s tough to untangle, not to say predict. Does it matter? In any given M&A deal, there are a handful of well-publicized ways deals can succeed, and a thousand obscure ways they can fray. Bankers, analysts, and management tend to focus on often-simple upsides: synergies, new products and talent, scale and scope, pricing power and leverage. But failure? Talent flees, products fizzle, synergies evaporate, lawsuits accumulate, innovation peels away like old wallpaper, and new deals always beckon. That may not be the case here. But it’s not a huge surprise that FIS stock fell by 5% on Monday after opening at $112, before closing 2% down, while Worldpay soared 9.3%. If that continues, FIS might have to hike the price or fend off another bidder—perhaps one that can really explain why it’s such a good deal in the first place.

0,"There’s going to be a new global giant in the payments business. Fidelity National Information Services      (ticker: FIS) said Monday that it had agreed to buy          Worldpay      (ticker: WP) for $34 billion in stock for a record international payments deal. FIS, which provides bank-office, credit-card processing and ATM services to banks, is a relatively small player in the payments business while Worldpay is a leader in that space, processing more than 40 billion transactions a year.The two companies said in a statement that they will focus on the “high-growth e-commerce” services. Shares of FIS are down almost 2% so far in trading Monday, while Worldpay stock surged about 9%There’s been a surge in mergers and acquisitions recently in the payments space. In January            Fiserv      agreed to buy          First Data      (FDC) for $22 billion.            PayPal Holdings      (PYPL) acquired iZettle for $2.2 billion last May, and private-equity firms have bought European firms Nets and Paysafe Group. The consolidation in the industry is largely the result of companies looking to gain pricing power by increasing market share, upgrading technology, and cutting costs. A rising global tide of electronic payments, particularly from online shopping, has lifted of companies such as PayPal over the last several years. It has also increased the premium for startups that have shown that they can add either tech know-how or customers to established companies. FIS’ acquisition of Worldpay “creates a powerhouse payments company and transforms FIS into a faster growing entity,” Cowen analyst George Mihalos wrote in a note to clients. The deal, he believes, “will accelerate total company growth meaningfully.” He rates FIS at Outperform with a $119 price target.

Perdue also sold class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock (            BRKb),      as well as            Microsoft      stock (MSFT) and            Cisco Systems      stock (CSCO), among other transactions.“Senator Perdue’s assets are managed by an outside financial advisor who ensures transactions are publicly reported in a timely fashion as required by the Senate Ethics Committee,” Purdue’s Senate office said in a statement.Perdue’s account bought AT&T stock in four transactions from Feb. 1 through Feb. 6, trades whose total combined value ranged from $32,004 to $130,000. (Specific values aren’t required for public disclosure, only ranges.) AT&T stock dove nearly 27% in 2018, and one overhang on the stock was an effort by the Department of Justice to undo the company’s acquisition of Time Warner. Now the deal no longer faces that challenge, and AT&T has taken to restructuring its acquired operations. AT&T stock has only eked out a gain of 4.4% so far this year through Wednesday’s close, less than half of the        S&P 500’s      10.6% rise.Perdue’s account sold First Data stock from Feb. 1 through 8, in sales that totaled between $32,004 and $130,000. The provider of technology services to banks and other financial firms has seen its stock surge 50% this year, compared with a mere 1% gain in 2018. Most of the upside in First Data stock this year is due to an agreement for the company to be acquired by            Fiserv      (FISV) in a stock swap.Berkshire Hathaway stock has been slipping this year. Class B shares are down 2% year to date after a 3% gain in 2018. A poor quarter at            Kraft Heinz      (KHC) and that company’s disclosure of an SEC probe sent Kraft stock tumbling in a rare public implosion of an investment by Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett. Berkshire owns a 27% stake in Kraft. Perdue’s account sold between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of Berkshire stock on Feb. 28.Perdue’s joint account also sold stock in two tech stalwarts, Microsoft and Cisco. He sold $15,001-$50,000 worth of each stock on Feb. 25. MIcrosoft stock had a boffo 2018, rising nearly 19%, while networking giant Cisco saw shares gain 13%. Both continue to rise in 2019, but Cisco stock is now ahead with a 19% year-to-date gain, while Microsoft stock has risen 10%. We’ve noted that Cisco is betting big on the next wireless standard, 5G.

1,"How a company’s stock reacts to its earnings report first and foremost depends on the quality of the results. But how the numbers come in relative to analysts’ expectations can be even more indicative of the way the stock reacts. And when investors have a strong view on a company’s upcoming trajectory going into an earnings report, any deviation can mean a sharp move in a stock’s price—sometimes seemingly counter to the actual reported results.For example, last Wednesday,            Facebook      (ticker: FB) posted 25% revenue growth and 8% profit growth for its latest quarter—both healthy increases for a company of its size and ahead of Wall Street consensus going into the report. But the social media giant had a high bar to hurdle. Facebook stock had well outperformed the market since it last reported earnings on Oct. 30, rising 19% versus a 7% gain for the        S&P 500      index. Just in the month before reporting, the stock and index rose 7% and 1%, respectively. Facebook also outpaced other technology stocks.That short-term optimism was clearly overblown. Facebook stock dropped over 6% on Thursday.There are 90 S&P 500 components releasing results this week. These are the ones that have climbed the most in the past month through Friday’s close, while the S&P 500 has returned less than 2%:Source: FactSetA couple of the biggest winners going into their earnings reports this week are defense stocks, like            L3Harris Technologies      (ticker: LHX), or suppliers of components to defense companies, like            TransDigm Group      (TDG). They both got a big bump in early January as Middle East tensions spiked, and escalating conflict between the U.S. and Iran looked likely. Management might be asked this week if they see a positive impact on their business going forward.Other stocks jumped due to specific one-time factors.            NortonLifeLock      (NLOK) saw its shares rise recently after it declared a special dividend.            Paycom Software      (PAYC) was added to the S&P 500 index in its latest reshuffling and saw buying from index funds.The stocks that have outperformed sharply over the past month without a clear catalyst—            Motorola Solutions      (MSI) or            FleetCor Technologies      (FLT)—are the ones to watch the most closely when they report this week. Investors are expressing their optimism by buying shares, and could still be disappointed by what is otherwise a strong report.Conversely, stocks that go into their earnings sitting on heavy recent losses might only need a slightly better-than-expected or in-line report to see a positive reaction.Here are this week’s reporters that have dropped the most over the past month:Source: FactSetHow a stock has performed before its earnings report of course can’t alone determine how the market will react to new information.

1,"In the payment processing world, gasoline sellers in Europe are behind their U.S. counterparts in outsourcing credit card operations, but its a big opportunity for two U.S. payment processing companies, according to fresh research from Jefferies.Jefferies analysts Ramsey El-Assal and Damian Wille note that that management of commercial fleet fuel cards in the United States has been outsourced over the past 20 years, but only two comparable programs have been outsourced in Europe and that could bring roughly $1 billion in new revenue. They think Georgia-based commercial fuel card processor FleetCor Technologies (FLT) and Maine-based payment processor Wex (WEX), will benefit. They write:Shares of FleetCor, which has a market capitalization of $15 billion, are up 14% this year; the Jefferies analysts see upside of 22% to $197.

0," Evercore ISI This morning, Hold-rated WEX announced an agreement with            Chevron      to issue and operate Chevron and Texaco-branded commercial fleet cards beginning in January 2018. Currently,            FleetCor Technologies      holds this contract.For 2018, the loss of the Chevron (ticker: CVX) contract will reduce our revenue estimate for FleetCor (FLT) by 3%. For 2018, the Chevron contract adds 5% to our forecast for WEX (WEX) revenue.We believe there is limited risk in FleetCor losing additional contracts. FleetCor has a long history of winning deals versus competitors driven by innovative new products and expanding relationships with global oil companies. For example, in August, FleetCor signed             Marathon Petroleum      (MPC) unit Speedway, a WEX customer. FleetCor has no material contracts up for renewal in 2017.WEX attributes its contract win to its strength as a business partner to Chevron. We believe WEX signed its new 10-year contract with Chevron at lower pricing than FleetCor’s current contract with Chevron.For WEX, we are increasing our 2018 earnings-per-share estimate by 25 cents to $6.30. We are raising the price target to $113 from $109.On Friday, FleetCor announced that as of Dec. 16, it had repurchased 1,259,145 shares of its common stock for an aggregate of $187.7 million. We now incorporate such share-repurchase into our model, which added 1% to both our 2017 and 2018 EPS estimates.For FleetCor, we are raising our 2016 EPS estimate by one cent to $6.89 and our 2017 EPS estimate by 11 cents to $8.51. We are reducing our 2018 revenue forecast by $77 million. However our 2018 EPS estimate remains unchanged given the recent accretive share repurchase. -- David Togut  -- Rayna Kumar  -- Anthony Cyganovich To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

1,"FleetCor Technologies      (FLT: NYSE)  By Wells Fargo Securities ($150.70, Nov. 18, 2016)We are upgrading shares of FleetCor Technologies to Outperform from Market Perform.Our valuation range for FleetCor (ticker: FLT) moves to $170-$180, up from $155-$165, reflecting the roll forward of the base year in our discounted cash flow (DCF) model to 2017. At its current price, FleetCor trades at 18.9 times our 2017 EPS estimate of $7.96, a discount to its long-term average forward price/earnings multiple of 20 times.In short, we believe the selloff since third-quarter results (FleetCor is down 13% since Nov. 1 close versus up 4% for the S&P 500) is overdone and creates an opportunity for investors. Although FleetCor’s third-quarter results were not its strongest, we remain optimistic about 2017, given: 1) foreign currency (FX) and fuel-related headwinds should be less significant and could end up being neutral; 2) the comparisons for FleetCor’s same-store metric should become more favorable beginning in the fourth quarter; and 3) FleetCor should realize increasing earnings-per-share accretion from its recently completed STP Brazilian electronic toll payments firm acquisition.Further, additional upside potential to our 2017 EPS estimate could come from a variety of sources, including: 1) an accretive acquisition; 2) share buyback; 3) managing down the tax rate; or 4) the awarding of a European outsourcing contract.Finally, we feel confident in FleetCor’s ability to generate mid-teens compound annual EPS growth over the next several years as a result of approximately 10% organic revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and accretive acquisitions and/or share buyback. -- Timothy Willi  -- Robert Hammel  -- Alan Donatiello The companies mentioned in Hot Research are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.

1," Barrington Research Our group of 27 electronic-transaction processors recorded a mean return of 2.73% for the month of February.The group average return at 2.73% was better than both the S&P 500 at 1.11% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 1.40%. The fourth-quarter earnings season was very strong. Of the 23 companies that reported results in the January/February time frame, 16 exceeded expectations, three met expectations and four missed their numbers.Since the beginning of the year, the bias has been to downside revisions for earnings-per-share estimates.

0,"The Wuhan coronavirus was largely responsible for Monday’s sharp decline in the stock market. But the prospect of a Bernie Sanders presidency could soon become a more immediate threat, according to some market analysts. For now—even though Sanders won the Nevada primary—he is largely viewed by investors as someone who is so radical that his candidacy ensures President Donald Trump’s reelection. If he emerges victorious in the March 3 Super Tuesday primaries, though, he would likely be viewed as the leading Democratic candidate to challenge Trump. If the Vermont senator can maintain front-runner status, he will be taken far more seriously by investors. Already, Wall Street is taking a more analytical view of his candidacy.Since his most recent primary victory, Sanders has begun to be analyzed by investors as a serious threat to the financial markets. He is starting to generate sector-specific threat analysis as investors try determining where he will cause the most damage if elected. The analysis is similar to efforts to measure the Wuhan virus damage to the global supply chain and thus corporate earnings and consumer spending.If Sanders is elected president, his policies could be especially harmful to stocks in the defense sector. He favors drastic cuts to military spending, which            Goldman Sachs      has advised clients as reasons to hedge key defensive stocks ahead of the March 3 primaries.In a recent note to clients, John Marshall, the bank’s derivatives strategist, and Noah Poponak, a defense analyst, wrote that Sanders has a “unique view” that military spending should be reduced, whereas his political rivals have remained mum. Trump has increased military spending while in office. “As the general election cycle approaches, and depending on the outcome of the Democratic nomination process, we see the potential for the market to increasingly differentiate defense stocks based on their position in the market; and also see the potential for increased volatility across much of the sector,” Marshall and Poponak advised clients.Investors who own some key defense stocks—and want to hedge an increase in election-related volatility—could buy defensive put options on            Kratos Defense & Security Solutions      (ticker: KTOS),            Flir Systems      (FLIR),            General Dynamics      (GD),            Huntington Ingalls Industries      (HII),            Mercury Systems      (MRCY), and Northrop Grumman (NOC). (Puts increase in value when the underlying security price declines.)In anticipation that political news will spook investors, Goldman Sachs advised clients to consider buying defensive puts that match the price of the underlying stock. So far, volatility remains reasonably priced around the bottom third of these stocks’ annual volatility range. Kratos and Flir, however, are priced at the very top of the range, suggesting that investors expect those stocks to soon come under pressure. If the bank’s analysis is correct, the stocks will soon come under pressure and the puts will increase in value. If the analysis is wrong, the money spent on the puts would be lost. The success of this type of trade is as difficult to prognosticate as the presidential election is. Still, that won’t stop investors from making such wagers at a time when it is hard to know if the anger of the electorate is once again poised to surprise Wall Street.The last go-round, Wall Street expected Hillary Clinton would be elected president. Bank and after bank theorized that Trump would be disastrous for the markets. Of course, they were wrong, all of which helps create uncertainty as the nation decides who will next live in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Email:  editors@barrons.com The Wuhan coronavirus was largely responsible for Monday’s sharp decline in the stock market.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1," Imperial Capital In security monitoring, we believe investors are enthusiastic about “smart home” innovations, but this may be tempered by indecision over which of these products make the best business case, and where multiple-apps being marketed will bring a sticky/longer-life customer with a higher upfront average revenue per user to offset the initial higher installation and service costs.One trend we believe investors may be adamant about is that companies must demonstrate a plan and execute to reduce attrition rates. We continue to stress that superior service and response will provide integrated security companies with professional monitoring major advantages along with improvements in key performance metrics over time.We highlight a select group of our coverage companies that will release earnings over the next several weeks: ADT (ticker:            ADT      ); Allegion (            ALLE      ); Anixter International (            AXE      ); Ascent Capital Group (          ASCMA      ); Brink’s (            BCO      ); Control4 (            CTRL      ); Diebold (            DBD      ); Digimarc (            DMRC      ); Fleetmatics Group (          FLTX      ); Flir Systems (            FLIR      ); and NIC (            EGOV      ).The slow growth retail and more general commercial environment has been a concern for many investors, and we believe cost cutting to achieve higher margins and greater earnings per share will become less acceptable by the investment community. For example, in our view, the tough-selling 2015 holiday season was a wake-up call for retailers to develop new, tech-enabled strategies to reach and retain customers. Retailers, particularly those with a large brick-and-mortar presence, are seeking answers to their questions regarding how they will grow the top-line. We believe that it is time for retailers to have a “two-way conversation” (using technology to understand preferences and suggest relevant products) with the end customer and provide a highly personalized in-store and online experience.We particularly highlight Checkpoint Systems (          CKP),      Digimarc, Tyco International (          TYC      ) and VeriFone Systems (          PAY      ) as coverage companies that are responding to customer needs most effectively and offering some of the most interesting tech-enabled solutions.The commercial industrial sector is growing very slowly, with wireless electronic locks beginning to replace mechanical locks as part of a total ID solution set which is part of a larger integrated security solution. However, there is significant growth in less expensive wireless locks at the small-and-medium business (SMB) level. We are witnessing a surge in order pipeline discussions rather than actual orders in the more regulated educational and health-care industries for these new locking and ID technologies; we anticipate that actual orders from these industries may increase later this year.The result is: 1) choice between a single open-platform technology (near field communication or Bluetooth low energy), and multiple locking platforms that can be integrated (though not as easily) and without the open application program interface of a single platform; and 2) more mergers and acquisitions (M&A), as evidenced by the merger of Kaba Holdings of Switzerland and Dorma of Germany, increase in SMB M&A activity at Assa Abloy of Sweden, and the acquisition of a substantial euro-platform, SimonsVoss Technologies, by Allegion. -- Jeff Kessler  -- Saliq Khan To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

1,"Many investors are fretting about the timing of the inevitable start of short-term rate hikes in the United States. But British banking giant Barclays argues that this event could end up being overwhelmed by the sheer force of global liquidity that is being created by accommodative central banks around the globe. Writing for U.K’s The Telegraph, veteran financial columnist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard points out that Barclays and other financial institutions are jumping aboard the idea that global liquidity will help stocks, including those in emerging markets. “Barclays has advised clients to jump into world stock markets with both feet, citing the fastest growth in the global money supply in over thirty years and an accelerating recovery in China,” writes Evans-Pritchard. Barclays Bests of Easy-Money-Fueled Stock Boom Though Pritchard writes that global equities rose by an average 15% over the six months after the last three U.S. rate-tightening cycles began, on average, Barclays argues that this time stocks globally are cheaper.“The cyclically-adjusted price to earnings ratio (CAPE) for the world’s equity markets is currently 18, compared to 25.5 at the beginning of the last rate rise episode in 2004,” writes Pritchard. “This is roughly 14% below the CAPE average since 1980, though critics say earnings have been artificially inflated by companies borrowing a rock-bottom rates to buy back their own stock.”Central to Barclays’ bullish argument is the contention that the growth of global M1 money – essentially cash and checking accounts – has surged, led by China and the eurozone. “This is higher than during the dotcom boom and the pre-Lehman BRICS boom,” writes Evans-Pritchard. He adds that Simon Ward, an economist with Henderson Global Investors, says that real M1 is now surging in China at the fastest rate since the post-Lehman credit blitz, though money data is cooling in the U.S.Anybody considering the argument that emerging markets could get a bounce, thanks in part to a sea of global liquidity, should rightfully ask: Which emerging markets are better than others?Writing for Bloomberg Gadfly, a new Web portal created by Bloomberg, money manager Nir Kaissar argues that emerging markets need to be differentiated by their vastly different valuations.  A Look at the Diverging Markets Everyone has grown accustomed to thinking about emerging markets as a monolith -- a collection of undifferentiated countries aspiring to the big leagues, with all of the heft and stability of more developed economies,” writes Kaissar. He goes on to separate the five most expensive markets from the five least expensive (based on their normalized P/Es) and calculated an average P/E for each. “The five most expensive trade at an average P/E of 16.8, whereas the five least expensive trade at an average P/E of 8.5 -- half the price,” he adds. “For example, Brazil and Russia are laughably low by any measure, even after accounting for the incremental emerging market risk and whatever idiosyncratic risks you wish to attribute to them (Vladimir Putin, anyone?). At the same time, the valuations in China and India are princely by any measure, particularly after accounting for the incremental emerging market risk, to say nothing of their own unique risks.”Kaissar argues that most emerging market countries today offer either classic growth or value opportunities. “You can buy cheaply and give up growth, or pay up for growth -- but you can’t do both. There are, in other words, diverging, emerging markets. It’s useful to think of them as such economically, politically and financially.”After reading this argument, one realized how much thinking one gives up by simply buying a broad-based emerging markets fund like the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (ticker:            EEM      ). I’ll close this column with a cautionary look at the type of investment columns that are ultimately of little use to investors. Though I often find many great investment stories on the Street Authority Website, a fresh piece focusing on stocks that stand to benefit from the war against terrorism isn’t one of them.  Firms on the Front Lines of War Against Terrorism The piece touts four companies: CyberArk Software (            CYBR),      AVG Technologies (          AVG      ) Tyco International (          TYC      ) and FLIR Systems (            FLIR      ).Each company gets a few paragraphs basically explaining why it’s a great company. What is missing is any discussion of how the stocks have performed lately or what the valuations are on these stocks. If the piece had views these companies as stocks as well as exciting businesses, it would have revealed some troubling details about a few of them. For example, AVG Technologies, which was trading at $24.36 on Oct 26, is now trading around $20 a share. What’s going on? The story fails to mention that the stock fell 17% in a day after reporting disappointing results for the third quarter. Not clear why an investment-oriented website writes pieces that fail to look at companies as stocks. But unfortunately, it happens more often than it should.

0,"After lagging the market most of the year, the aerospace and defense sector is poised to rally. Given how far it has fallen and the pattern from which it is emerging, several stocks in the group are in great positions for decent gains in the coming months.The NYSE Arca Defense Index recently emerged from an inverted or upside-down head-and-shoulders pattern (see Chart 1). And after a small pause, it now looks ready to break out to the upside through its declining March trendline.  NYSE Arca Defense Index Indeed, momentum readings are already solid and many of its component stocks are finally seeing inflows of money, or at least no longer seeing outflows. In short, price and indicators seem to have turned the corner. The fundamentals look positive too: Some analysts see the budget deal in Washington as a tailwind for defense stocks.As is often the case, some stocks in the group are doing much better and others are still not ripe for investors. General Electric (ticker:            GE      ) and Lockheed Martin            (LMT      ) are already at 52-week highs. Esterline Technologies (          ESL      ) remains in a strong down trend without a sign that price is ready to reverse to the upside.But the stocks in the middle of the pack mimic the sector index’s pattern and are most interesting. For example, Rockwell Collins (          COL      ) recently broke its May trendline to the upside and also completed the formation of its own inverted head-and-shoulders pattern (see Chart 2). Granted, the pattern is unorthodox, with the central low – the head – actually being a pair of lows. But complex “body parts,” as I call them, do not diminish the pattern’s predictive value. Rockwell Collins Should prices move above the neckline, or resistance level at the top of the pattern, then the stock has a good shot at recapturing most of its 2015 losses. There is one more bit of bullish evidence from last week’s trading. Friday, the company released disappointing fourth quarter earnings and the stock fell sharply on very heavy volume. Normally, that would be considered a bearish sign. Monday, however, the stock rebounded nicely. Good trading action following bad news is bullish. Still, we have to let the stock break through resistance before declaring victory for the bulls. United Technologies (            UTX),      a Dow Jones Industrial Average component, also sports a variation of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern (see Chart 3). However, it has not moved above any trendlines drawn from earlier this year.  United Technologies The latter is not necessarily a problem due to the configuration of the chart itself. We can use the 50-day moving average as a proxy for short-term trend and it suggests a stock on the mend. A move above last week’s pre-earnings high will be the sign for the bulls. And if that happens, the stock could rally 16% to its next major zone of resistance.Embraer S/A (          ERJ      ) and Textron (            TXT),      while operating in different segments of the defense sector, sport similarly bullish charts. One stock in the group that has not fared well recently is Flir Systems (            FLIR      ). Unlike many of its peers, it lost ground last month, but that may have already ended with a selling climax (see Chart 4). On Oct. 28 the company announced that it missed third quarter earnings and the stock fell sharply, accelerating its already falling trend. Volume that day spiked to an exceptionally heavy level as the last bulls panicked out at any price. It was a classic sign of downside exhaustion. Flir Systems This final washout for the year cleared the decks for any good news or increase in demand that might come its way. Since the low that day, Flir has rallied nearly 10% to confirm that the transition is well under way. This turnaround is a bit riskier than a breakout from a more traditional chart pattern as seen above. For investors with a higher tolerance for risk, however, this could be a good story in a few months. But for the typical investor, one of my favorite strategies is buying newly emerging stocks in strong groups. There are plenty of these setups in the defense sector.

0,"Security software stocks were getting a boost on Tuesday from Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Essex, who picked up coverage of the sector with a bullish slant. “We believe IT security offers attractive levels of exposure to growth technology, and that profitable companies with this exposure could outperform the market through the mature stages of an economic expansion cycle due to the durability of underlying spending,” he wrote in a lengthy report. “Durability in spending is supported by digital transformation initiatives across all verticals.”Essex said his conversations with executives found that information-technology security spending “is well positioned for healthy growth and is among the least likely budget items to be trimmed as attack surface exposure continues to grow.” He also noted that security vendors are shifting their businesses to be more predictable, as they adopt subscription models. And he said a wave of consolidation in the sector lies ahead, offering valuation support for some of the narrower vendors that might make acquisition bait for larger players.Essex initiated coverage of seven stocks. He set three Buy ratings:            Palo Alto Networks      (ticker: PANW),            Fortinet       (FTNT) and            Verint Systems      (VRNT). He rates            Check Point Software       (CHKP),            FireEye       (FEYE) and            Zscaler      (ZS) as Neutral. He started            SecureWorks       (SCWX) with a Sell rating.Here are brief comments on each company from his report:  All three of the Buy rated stocks were trading higher, with Fortinet the standout, up 3.3% to $99.09 near midday. The Neutral-rated names were also higher, with Zacaler up 1.2%, to $44.58. SecureWorks shares were down 2.8%, to $11.39. The        S&P 500       was up 0.3%. Write to Eric J.

0,"Crowdstrike       stock (ticker: CRWD) was trading sharply lower Monday after Citi analyst Walter Pritchard launched coverage of the newly public cloud-based edge security company with a Sell rating and $43 target price. Pritchard also picked up coverage of three other security-related companies, starting Okta(OKTA) with a Buy rating and $150 target, Ping Identity(PING) with a Buy rating and $22 target, and            Zscaler      (ZS) with a Neutral rating and $50 target.The bearish position on Crowdstrike follows just after Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini on Friday cut her rating on the company to Sell from Hold.“Security has been at the top of CIO spending priorities for over a decade, but the market remains highly fragmented as large spenders put a premium on ‘best of breed’ technology and competition from below (VC-backed) is fierce,” Pritchard writes in a note reviewing the new coverage and his broader thinking on security-software stocks. “It has been challenging for public companies to drive sustained hyper-growth beyond an individual product and to amass the sort of market share (better than 10-20%) we see in other areas of software.”Pritchard says he looks for areas where “something is changing in the underlying IT landscape” to enable addressable markets to expand beyond historical levels and beyond what investors reflect in current prices. In particular, he likes the identity-management sector, and recommends Ping, Okta, and            Sailpoint Technologies      (SAIL). Zscaler is a play on the same trend, but he finds the stock’s valuation is “lofty.”“We see identity management (IDM) becoming more strategic as companies move to cloud,” he writes, “with historical IDM spend that has gone to the infrastructure providers like            Oracle      (ORCL) and            IBM      (IBM) now being up for grabs.”He also says that in some “defensive security” markets challengers are replacing incumbents, with companies like            Check Point Software      (CHKP),            FireEye      (FEYE),            Forescout       (FSCT),            Fortinet      (FTNT), and            SecureWorks      (SCWX) struggling to keep their installed customer base.Pritchard writes that his three favorite stocks in the sector are            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW), Okta, and Ping, while his three least favorites are Fortinet,            Splunk       (SPLK), and Crowdstrike. He recommends two pair trades: buy Palo Alto Networks and sell Fortinet; and buy Okta and sell Crowdstrike.As for Crowdstrike, he writes that while recent growth “has generated a lot of excitement,” he sees “its market opportunity largely pegged to the end-point security market, where peak leadership share has been in the neighborhood of ~10%,” and he sees limited room for share gains. Pritchard says the company’s ability to expand into adjacent markets will be challenging as logical markets are already crowded. “We acknowledge there is likely significant upside to conservative IPO syndicate-driven consensus estimates, but believe this is reflected in the stock price,” he adds.In Monday’s trading, Crowdstrike was down 7% at $56.05, Ping was up 2% at $16.76, Zscaler was off 0.7% at $47.77, Okta was up 2%, at $118.58, Fortinet was up 0.5%, at $79.55, Splunk was down 0.6% to $120.11, and Palo Alto Networks was up 1% to $212.41.

1,"CrowdStrike shares are heading higher Monday after at least 15 analysts picked up coverage of the newly listed cloud-based security software company. Most of the analysts have a bullish stance. CrowdStrike Holdings      (ticker: CRWD) went public last month at $34 a share, then roared higher, quickly doubling its IPO price. Today, the stock is up $3.08, or 4.6%, to $70.29, boosting the company’s market cap to close to $14 billion. Tech stocks are generally down on the day with the        Nasdaq Composite      off 1% Monday afternoon.  Read Barron’s recent cover story on IPOs SunTrust analyst Terry Tillman writes that the company’s platform offers “unmatched protection against cyberattacks.” Few analysts dispute that CrowdStrike is growing like a weed and providing a crucial service. The question is really about valuation. For the January 2019 fiscal year, the company posted revenue of $249.8 million; if you assume sales double this year to about $500 million, then the company would be trading at about 28 times revenue estimates for the next 12 months. But that’s a particularly optimistic forecast—most estimates are a little north of $400 million, which would imply a multiple of 35 times sales. That compares with about seven times for            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW) and            Fortinet      (FTNT), both certainly growing much more slowly than CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike’s rich valuation makes upside harder for even some upbeat analysts to find: Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini sees a lot to like in the story, for instance, but considers the story baked into the stock price. She set a Neutral rating and $66 target price Barron’s counts at least 15 analyst initiations on the stock today, with 10 Buy or outperform ratings, and five Hold or Neutrals.The bullish view is that CrowdStrike will remain in hypergrowth for multiple years. “Only solutions that are 100% developed for the cloud can take full advantage of the hyperscale and performance benefits of cloud computing,” writes J.P. Morgan analyst Sterling Auty, who launched coverage with an Overweight rating and $100 price target. “That is the approach that CrowdStrike took from day one. This has allowed the company to work off a single lightweight agent...that requires significantly less computing resources than the competition.”Oppenheimer’s Shaun Eyal, who started coverage with an Outperform rating and $90 price target, thinks CrowdStrike will continue to gain market share from legacy security software players and sees a large and growing addressable market that should top $30 billion by 2020. JMP Securities analyst Erik Suppiger calls the company the “premier brand” in cloud-based endpoint security, a market he considers “ripe for disruption.” Needham’s Alex Henderson, who launches with a Buy rating, asserts that CrowdStrike can “grow into” its high valuation.

The back story. Fortinet stock (ticker: FTNT) shares are up about 9% this year, underperforming the        Nasdaq Composite,      which has risen roughly 21%. The shares are now 20% below their high. What’s new. JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty on Monday raised his rating on Fortinet to Overweight from Neutral, saying the valuation now seems attractive.“Concerns over demand for network security appear overdone,” he wrote. “Our recent research points to consistent demand for the company, and with the proper execution we expect near-term results to propel shares higher, delivering outperformance for the second half of the year.”Fortinet stock was up 0.5% to $76.49 on Monday.The analyst said his checks with people in the industry indicate firewall companies like Fortinet have lots of deals in their pipelines this month and will likely end the quarter with solid earnings.

1," Mostly Positive Feelings. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged gains on Thursday, while the Nasdaq ended the day slightly in the red. President Donald Trump is expected to announce a summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to complete a trade deal. India’s central bank cut its main lending rate by 25 basis points for the second time this year to 6%.            Tesla      (ticker: TSLA) stock plunged after missing its first-quarter shipping expectation.            Constellation Brands      (STZ) stock climbed on upbeat earnings report. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Borders, Trade, and Jobs Stocks mostly rose on Thursday except for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      gained 166.50 points, or 0.64%, to end at 26,384.63. The        S&P 500      added 5.99 points, or 0.21%, to close at 2879.39, and the        Nasdaq Composite      slipped 3.77 points, or 0.05%, to end at 7891.78.Talking to reporters on Thursday, President Donald Trump backed off his threat to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it a “one-year warning” meant to push Mexico to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. Trump also mulled imposing tariffs on Mexican products, particularly cars. “The only thing frankly better, but less drastic than closing the border, is to tariff the cars coming in,” he said.“It’s difficult to see this as a credible threat,” wrote Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at The Wilson Center in a note on Thursday. “Imposing tariffs on cars for this reason would be a huge violation of existing trade rules. What’s more it would be immensely costly for U.S. auto producers and consumers.” Wood thinks the Mexican government will likely view the threat with skepticism and frustration, as it made significant concessions to Trump on migration last week.German manufacturers saw orders drop a sharp 4.2% in February from the previous month, missing expectations by a large margin. Compared with February 2018, order volumes were down a steep 8.4%. The slowdown in Germany increased the likelihood of economic contraction in the eurozone, with Italy already in recession and the French economy hit by protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s reform agenda.The U.S. jobs report for March is set to be released Friday, and investors are particularly eager to see the data following February’s weak results. U.S. labor market only added 20,000 jobs last month, much lower than expected. The shortfall was “a shock,” wrote Brad McMillan from Commonwealth Financial Network in a Thursday note. “Given the other signs of weakness in the economy, it raised the question of whether things were worse than anyone had really thought. That question is hanging over tomorrow’s report.”McMillan noted that job growth has come in very low twice before in recent years—once in May 2016 and once in September 2017. Both times sharp rebounds followed. “That is the most likely result this month,” wrote McMillan, “Last month’s number may have been due to terrible weather and may have been partial payback for a very strong January.” The initial jobless claims fell to 202,000 this week from last week’s 211,000, the lowest level since 1969. Economists currently expect to see March adding 175,000 jobs. But there are signs that a weaker report may be in the cards, wrote McMillan. The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed 129,000 more jobs were created in March, the lowest level seen since September 2017 and well below expectations, noted McMillan. Job growth at smaller firms, historically an engine of growth, was close to flat. Manufacturing payrolls were actually down, wrote McMillan.McMillan expects job growth to come in around 150,000 in March, below expectations but still not too worrisome. Any number weaker than that, however, might suggest a real possibility of job growth slowdown. “We have not had two consecutive months under 150,000 since 2017,” wrote McMillan. The Hot Stock Constellation Brands stock rose to the top of the S&P 500 on Thursday, on the heels of its fourth-quarter earnings report.Constellation Brands stock climbed $11.76, or 6.6%, to $191.45.Investors were heartened by the company’s core beer business in the latest quarter, as well as the growth potential of its marijuana investment.In the past 12 months, Constellation Brands stock has fallen 15.5%.

0,"Shares of security technology vendor Palo Alto Networks (PANW) are down $3.98, or 2.6%, at $153.24, after Goldman Sachs’s Gabriela Borges this morning cut her rating on the shares to Neutral from Buy, and cut her price target to $168 from $171, after concluding the outlook for the industry is “more muted” this year than last, and the stock’s risk and reward are “balanced at current levels.Palo Alto’s firewall market won’t see big “refresh” buying until 2019 or 2020, writes Borges, and it’s not clear that Palo Alto’s “platform” can be successful outside of the firewall market.On the industry side, the problem is that adoption of public cloud computing is putting pressure on firewall sales, writes Borges.Virtual firewall adoption for public cloud workloads has lagged,” writes Borges, and we believe many customers to date are choosing not to use a firewall vendor (virtual or physical) to secure their cloud-hosted workloads.And for Palo Alto, which makes 5% of its “billings” off of subscription sales that are not tied to firewall sales, “there is limited visibility into whether Palo Alto can drive critical mass with unattached subscriptions, which we think will be key for the stock to rerate sustainably higher,” writes Borges.Given attached subscription growth has been slowing as a function of appliance growth slowing, growth in unattached will be key to proving Palo Alto’s value proposition as a platform that extends beyond firewalls in a hybrid computing world.In related commentary this morning, Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray this morning offers up data from a survey of resellers of computer security gear, conducted across 52 channel partners in North America and Europe.Nowinski finds that Palo Alto had the best feedback from these resellers, relative to competitors, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Fortinet (FTNT), Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), and others.Palo Alto Networks had the best results in our survey,” writes Nowinski, with 52% of resellers Above Plan in 4Q17, up from 44% in 3Q17.As such, we are expecting solid results in the January quarter from Palo Alto and continue to recommend Palo Alto as our top large-cap pick.Shares of security technology vendor Palo Alto Networks (PANW) are down $3.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Shell Transport and Trading Company, a predecessor company to Royal Dutch Shell, unveiled its first logo in 1901: a mussel shell.Three years later, the logo was changed to the now-familiar scallop shell, but          Shell       (ticker: RDS.A) still has plenty of muscle to flex, both in its energy business and in investing.Consider subsidiary Shell Asset Management Company, known as SAMCo, which appoints external managers to handle the company’s pension assets. At the end of 2016, those assets stood at 27.3 billion euros (against liabilities of 22.4 billion euros). Most of it, 52%, is allocated to fixed-income investments, while 18% is designated for alternate investments. Twenty-six percent is pegged to publicly listed equities, which returned 10.2% for SAMCo in 2016; that double-digit gain was certainly respectable, but still about two percentage points shy of what the Standard & Poor’s 500 returned, including reinvested dividends.What’s interesting is that according to S&P Capital IQ, SAMCo’s $4.5 billion in investments that are subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filings largely reflect the allocations of the index. Its top holdings are in information technology (21.8%), financials (16.7%) and health care (11.3%), which correspond to the S&P 500’s sector weightings of 23.6%, 14.7% and 14.6%, respectively.We’ve declared that Shell is “The Best Big Oil Stock” in a recent cover story, but, curiously, SAMCo actually has a lower allocation to energy than the S&P 500: 5.6% to the index’s 5.9%.In the third calendar quarter, SAMCo reduced most of its U.S.-traded holdings, including each of its largest 25 holdings by dollar volume, including            Microsoft      (MSFT),            Apple      (AAPL) and American depositary receipts of          Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA).Speaking of Apple, SAMCo hasn’t been afraid to think differently. It owns shares in            Tesla      (TSLA), albeit a reduced position to 6,200 shares at the end of the third quarter from 7,900 at the end of the second quarter. A car powered by an electric battery may be anathema to most big oil companies, but Shell plans to provide charging services at its gas stations.In the face of SAMCo’s overwhelming bias to sell shares (1,008 reduced or sold-out positions out of 1,237 total publicly traded stock, according to S&P Capital IQ), it’s intriguing to regard what the pension manager’s been buying.The Shell unit raised its stake in            PayPal Holdings      (PYPL) to 98,000 shares at the end of the third quarter from 80,500 shares. Shell, in some countries, already allows motorists to pay using PayPal through its Fill Up & Go app. We recently spoke with the head of an asset-management firm who sees PayPal shares heading to $100; that would mean 42% upside from Tuesday’s close at $70.21.SAMCo thinks it can see a higher valuation in            Alcoa      (AA), as it initiated a position of 30,500 shares in the aluminum giant. Last week Alcoa reported disappointing third-quarter earnings but the company raised its estimate for full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) to $2.4 billion, up from $2.1 billion-$2.2 billion, on stronger alumina and aluminum prices.In an acrobatic move, the Shell unit bought about 12,000 more shares of            Adobe Systems      (ADBE), bringing its holdings in the software giant to 51,000 shares as of Sept. 30. Adobe shares, along with the market indexes, have been trading in record territory after a boost last week on a bullish outlook.SAMCo expects            FedEx (FDX)      to continue delivering strong returns and raised its stake in the logistics firm by 6,000 more shares to 24,100 shares. FedEx stock has been stubbornly resilient so far this year, even in the face of disappointing earnings, a cyberattack and encroachment byAmazon.com      (AMZN).In the face of cyberattacks, SAMCo is big on security, evidenced by increased shareholdings in            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW) and            Fortinet      (FTNT) to 18,400 shares and 60,000 shares on Sept. 30, respectively, from 5,400 shares and 7,500 shares on June 30, respectively. We noted an analyst who was bearish on the two stocks last month. But Fortinet reports third-quarter earnings Thursday and has found favor with another analyst. The numbers could bear out which way Fortinet is headed.Shell is going whole hog for            Harley-Davidson      (HOG), increasing its holdings to 221,500 shares from 184,000 shares. The motorcycle maker has been having a wobbly year, with shares down 15% so far through Tuesday’s close. We’ve been bearish about its prospects, most recently in July. Maybe Shell is thinking this could be a Tesla-like play. After all Harley-Davidson is contemplating a motorcycle with an electric engine. It’s further back in the production cycle, however. There are still job postings for engineers to work on it, and these bikes won’t be rumbling into a Shell station to charge up in the near future. Comments?

Short interest is 3.9% of the float. Analyst consensus is neutral: 36% at Buy/Overweight; 50% at Hold/Sector Weight; 14% at Sell/Underweight; and an $85 mean price target.Channel commentary remains mixed and the mix shift to subscription is making the business less predictable. Historically, the third quarter is a decent NetScaler quarter, but we note this quarter will be against a tougher comparison. News of a restructuring, a new sales chief, and mix shift add risk to guidance, in our view. We believe Citrix will achieve in-line results and guide in line to down.Since the second-quarter report, Citrix has continued to shake up management and announced a new restructuring plan, but we expect the focus to center on newly segmented subscription revenue, which would frame the potential of Citrix Service Provider (CSP) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue.ServiceNow also reports Oct. 25 (Wednesday afternoon). Street sentiment is positive. Shares have fallen 1.0% in the past five days and have risen 3.5% in the past month, compared to the Nasdaq Composite Index at 4.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Short interest is 6.7% of the float. Analyst consensus is positive: 85% at Buy/Overweight; 15% at Hold/Sector Weight; 0% at Sell/Underweight; and a $128 mean price target.Industry checks point to strong adoption of ServiceNow’s portfolio, with growing traction in newer categories beyond IT Service Management (ITSM). Expectations appear modest relative to the company’s track record of new additions and increasing monetization of a rapidly growing Global 2000 (G2K) base. We expect a beat and raise. We will review our outlook after the company reports earnings next week.Fortinet reports Oct. 26 (Thursday afternoon). Street sentiment is positive to neutral. Shares have risen 4.4% in the past five days and 4.4% in the past month, compared to the Nasdaq Composite Index at 4.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Short interest is 2.1% of the float. Analyst consensus is positive: 67% at Buy/Overweight; 27% at Hold/Sector Weight; 7% at Sell/Underweight; and a $43 mean price target.Reseller conversations indicated healthy renewal and expansion activity for Fortinet’s core solution, in addition to continued traction of non-Fortigate offerings as cloud-enabled platforms remain in demand. We continue to expect the company to benefit from a firewall refresh in 2018. We believe quarterly results and guidance should be in line or exceed expectations.While expectations for Fortinet have increased over the past month, we anticipate strong quarterly results and remain positive on the long-term margin-expansion opportunity. -- Rob Owens  -- Liz Verity  -- Mike Casado The opinions contained in Investors’ Soapbox in no way represent those of Barrons.com or Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0," Credit Suisse We attended the semi-annual ONUG (One Networking User Group) Conference in New York, where information-technology (IT) leaders from several large enterprises discussed cloud strategies – public, private, multi-cloud -- as well as opportunities in digital transformation disruption.Key takeaways include:1) Data enable the digital transformation. We believe that data remain key to digital transformation, and is increasingly a beneficiary and important enabler of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Our takeaway is data will increasingly be used to drive productivity growth, which has stalled from an average of 2.5% between 1999-2006 (Source: WEF). Data drive efficiency but also creates new revenue streams, while transforming enterprise IT from a cost center to a business driver. We reiterate our Outperform rating on            Oracle      (ticker: ORCL) as well as          Hortonworks      (HDP), which we believe maintains an attractive position in the fast-growing Big Data market. We also believe the growing use of machine data to manage risk, improve customer outcomes, and drive efficiencies benefits Splunk (SPLK).2) Traditional network security is obsolete. Our discussions reaffirm our view that traditional perimeter security is ripe for disruption, with the cloud dissolving the concept of the network perimeter. We agree with the model espoused by several conference panelists who envisage security evolving around a data-centric model, with perimeters emerging around workloads and identities. As further evidence of our thesis, ONUG attendees identified scale and operational limitations of traditional security appliances. We also emphasize that security increasingly hinges on visibility, and analytics solutions such as Splunk, as ONUG attendees indicated the need to share user contextual awareness with applications in modern security solutions. We reiterate our Underperform ratings on            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW) and            Fortinet      (FTNT).3) Private, public and the multi-cloud? We believe Enterprises have largely settled on a hybrid cloud model, but see some difference in strategies. While companies like            General Electric      (GE) favor the public cloud, capping their private-cloud use, others like Fidelity see greater total cost of ownership (TCO) advantages in operating private-cloud deployments at scale. ONUG attendees identified lower cost (31%) and greater agility/time-to-market (31%) as the primary drivers of public-cloud adoption, but also see the various public clouds as too differentiated (69%) to avoid lock-in.  -- Brad Zelnick  -- Syed Talha Saleem  -- Kevin Ma  The opinions contained in Investors’ Soapbox in no way represent those of Barrons.com or Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1," Piper Sandler predicts the chip sector will thrive this year due to rising demand from the 5G infrastructure and smartphone markets. “In our view, 2020 appears to be a major recovery year for the semiconductor market,” analyst Harsh Kumar wrote on Wednesday. “Inventory levels are low across the board, and with a soothing trade narrative, we expect a strong pick-up in demand.” The analyst cites research firm            Gartner’s      forecast, which estimates chip industry sales will rise 12.5% this year after 2019’s 12% decline. Here are three Overweight-rated chip companies that made the firm’s top ideas list for 2020. Nvidia (ticker: NVDA)Piper Sandler has a $275 price target for Nvidia stock.“In our view, gaming is back in growth mode and set to grow in the double-digit range in calendar 2020,” Kumar wrote. “We do not see AMD Advanced Micro Devices gaining much share in 2020, as NVDA is known as the must-have gaming card.”The analyst also expects Nvidia’s data-center business to improve.Nvidia shares were trading down 0.9%, at $245.09, on Wednesday. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)The firm has a $150 price target for NXP Semiconductors shares.“Our thesis on NXPI revolves around the broader automotive market stabilizing,” he wrote. “NXPI is well positioned for content growth, led by the company’s complete battery management system.”The analyst noted that 50% of the company’s sales are auto industry-related.

1," Henry Ellenbogen, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price New Horizons fund (ticker: PRNHX), lead portfolio manager for the firm’s U.S. small-cap growth equity strategy, and group chief investment officer of U.S. equity growth, will leave T. Rowe Price on March 31 to launch his own venture.Josh Spencer, manager of the        T. Rowe Price Global Technology      fund (PRGTX), will replace Ellenbogen at the helm of New Horizons and as portfolio manager of the U.S. small-cap growth equity strategy. Spencer will be succeeded as manager of the Global Technology fund and leader of the firm’s global technology team by Alan Tu, an equity research analyst covering infrastructure software companies.T. Rowe Price issued a statement thanking Ellenbogen for his “many contributions” to the firm and expressing confidence that both Spencer and Tu “will provide strong leadership” to their respective strategies. “Josh Spencer is a talented investor in his own right, and his experience as an analyst, portfolio manager, and a member of Henry’s investment advisory team make him well-suited for his new role,” the firm said. A T. Rowe Price spokesman declined to comment. Read more: A Trash Stock and Other Picks From a T. Rowe Price Fund Manager Ellenbogen, 46, joined T. Rowe Price in 2001 and has managed New Horizons since March 2010. The fund, with about $24 billion in assets, is rated five stars by Morningstar and ranked first in its Mid-Cap Growth category over the past 10 years, returning 21.25% on an annualized basis through Feb. 13, according to Morningstar. The fund closed to new investors in 2013.Ellenbogen has been a member of the Barron’s Roundtable since 2018. Regarding his departure from T. Rowe Price and his future plans, Ellenbogen told Barron’s, “I will follow the same advice I give other entrepreneurs at similar points in their careers. First, I will properly transition the New Horizons fund to a new portfolio manager. Then I will take time to reflect on the relationship between companies and investors and spend time with my family before I start my next act.”He wouldn’t discuss details regarding his new venture. Under Ellenbogen, New Horizons invested a small portion of assets in early-stage private companies, some of which subsequently went public. The fund was an early backer of            Twitter      (TWTR) and            Grubhub      (GRUB), among others. Ellenbogen described his investment strategy in an August 2017 interview with Barron’s, saying, “About 30% of our capital is in early-stage growth companies with the potential to become much larger; 70% is in durable-growth companies.”It has been a winning approach: In addition to its stellar 10-year performance, New Horizons has beaten its        Russell 2000 Growth Index      benchmark over the past one, three, and five years. The fund returned an average of 10.3% annually over the five years ended Dec. 31; 13.8% over three years; and 4.04% over one year. It has returned about 15% this year to date.Vail Resorts      (MTN) was New Horizons’ largest position as of year end. Vail’s shares are roughly unchanged from 12 months ago, after soaring last spring and then falling sharply. Sizing up the ski-resort operator’s recent challenges, which included a shortfall in season-pass sales, Ellenbogen said at the 2019 Barron’s Roundtable, “For any durable company, there are times when the competitive moat gets tested. You can assess whether the business model has withstood the competition. We think Vail did, and will grow by double digits this year.”Ellenbogen also recommended            Gartner      (IT),            Waste Connections      (WCN), and            SS&C Technologies Holdings      (SSNC) at the January gathering.Ellenbogen participated in Barron’s Silicon Valley Roundtable last November, a gathering of venture capitalists that also included Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and partner at Greylock Partners. “The most interesting companies to invest in are those providing building blocks that allow other companies to become more nimble,” Ellenbogen said at the Roundtable, citing payments-processor Stripe; ServiceTitan, a supplier of HVAC/electrical software; and Toast, a supplier of restaurtant-management software, as examples.Asked about one big thing investors should watch for from the VC business or innovation economy in 2019, Ellenbogen said, “Technology—and the innovative spirit—is a big driver of our economy, and it isn’t independent from where you stand on Brand USA and our stance on global immigration. The U.S. is in long-term competition for global intellectual capital to drive innovation. Three panelists here at the Silicon Valley Roundtable were born outside the U.S. Ensuring that this is a place where diverse talent can come and build companies that continue to drive our economy is superimportant.” Write to Lauren R.

1,"Wall Street is growing more optimistic about the technological path            Advanced Micro Devices      (ticker: AMD) has laid out for itself.On Tuesday, the company held a showcase that unveiled new details about the products it is planning. At the event, AMD also announced its EPYC server processors were now available for use on the leading cloud-computing provider,            Amazon.com’s      (AMZN) Amazon Web Services. The company’s stock rose 3.9% during Tuesday’s trading session.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated his Buy rating for AMD stock, saying the Amazon deal will spur more gains for the company’s server chip business.“We view the AWS announcement as particularly noteworthy and believe it could cause other cloud players to deploy AMD server MPU instances,” he wrote on Tuesday. MPUs are microprocessor units. AMD stock rose 4% on Wednesday to $21.50.According to            Gartner,      Amazon Web Services was the leader in cloud computing with a 52% market share last year, followed by            Microsoft      (MSFT),          Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA), and            Alphabet’s      (GOOGL) Google.Lipacis predicts AMD’s new server-chip offering, named “Rome,” which the company said will be launched in the middle of next year, will lift the company’s share of the server-chip market to a double-digit percentage by 2020 versus an estimated 5% at year-end. The analyst reaffirmed his target of $30 for AMD’s stock price.In similar fashion, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay reiterated his Outperform rating for AMD shares. He has a $26 price forecast for the stock.“We attended AMD’s 7nm product event that showcased a strong road map that should align well with our share gain thesis,” he wrote on Tuesday. “We’ve long believed that Rome would be a breakthrough product in terms of the competitive landscape between AMD and            Intel,      and the presentations gave no dent to the thesis.”Intel (INTC) has suffered from repeated delays in moving to 10-nanometer chip-manufacturing technology, while AMD, its chief rival, expects to produce 7nm server chips in volume next year. One nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter. Smaller nanometer chipmaking technologies historically have allowed companies to create faster, more power-efficient chips.AMD stock has rallied more than 100% this year on rising expectations it will gain market share from Intel due to its increasingly competitive chip technology.

0,"Three summers ago, Mike Lippert was cycling with his wife near Lake Tahoe when, inexplicably, he crashed and suffered a spinal-cord injury. He spent a week in a medically induced coma and several weeks in the hospital before being transported home to New York for rehabilitation.When Lippert, 51, walked onto the stage at Lincoln Center that November for the annual Baron Investment Conference, he was overwhelmed with emotion. “There are so many lessons you learn when you go through a thing like this,” says the manager of the $430 million        Baron Opportunity      fund (ticker: BIOPX).Among other things, it drove home the importance of staying focused on what he can control, and not getting frustrated with what he can’t—a critical skill for any investor. The experience also affirmed just how much Lippert loves his work: “I’m intellectually challenged every day, and I get to meet people who are doing unbelievably cool things,” he says.First launched in 2000, the Opportunity fund invests in innovation through companies instigating change or benefiting from it. Lippert, who has managed the fund since early 2006, has posted an 12.1% average annual return over the past decade, better than 87% of all mid-cap growth funds.Like most managers at Baron Capital, Lippert aims to find growth companies with sustainable competitive advantages, and the potential to double in value over a four- or five-year period. Yet, he focuses exclusively on companies influenced by what he calls sustainable secular trends, or major changes in the way people work and live.*Returns through 8/28; five- and 10-year returns are annualized. Holdings as of 7/31Sources: Morningstar; Baron CapitalA history major turned corporate attorney, Lipper worked in intellectual-property litigation for about a decade, eventually making partner at a law firm. Then he decided it was time for a career change. Following a brief stint at a hedge fund, he landed an analyst position at Baron Capital in 2001.His investing style, it turns out, isn’t entirely different from the work he did as a litigator. “One of the partners at my law firm used to say, ‘No wishes, hopes, and dreams…go find the evidence and prove it,’ ” recalls Lippert, who supplements his own research with that of Baron’s more than two dozen analysts. They typically validate information from company management with additional research involving customers, suppliers, competitors, and industry experts.Lippert tracks and compares holding details in a spreadsheet he created to help him pinpoint ideal position sizes, and spot unforeseen risks. The fund, which can invest in companies of any size, owns its share of megacaps, including top holdings            Amazon.com      (AMZN),            Microsoft      (MSFT), and            Alphabet      (GOOGL). But lesser-known companies also drive overall returns. Top-five holding            Guidewire Software      (GWRE), which has a tiny weighting in Baron Opportunity’s Russell 3000 Growth benchmark, is a significant contributor to fund performance. Lippert, who is a fan of Software-as-a-Service business models—they enjoy steadily recurring revenue and sticky customer relationships—calls Guidewire a “poster child for the kind of companies we’re looking for.”The fund bought Guidewire shortly after its 2012 initial public offering. The company has the dominant market share in software used by property and casualty companies to run their core businesses and manage customer relationships. Guidewire has lost only one customer it its history, he says, “and they came back.”Lippert has come back, too, buying more Guidewire stock since the IPO. “We believe this is going to be a 20% grower for a very long time,” he says.Gartner      (IT), a technology research and consulting firm, is another top holding in the fund, with an outsize weighting relative to the benchmark. While Gartner is best known for its information-technology research, the company has also acquired expertise in major business functions, from customer service to supply-chain management. Its subscription model translates into a “high-margin, cash-flow-generative business that is benefiting from all the changes going on in technology,” says Lippert, who first bought the stock in 2007.The manager scooped up shares of            Tesla      (TSLA) six years ago, at about $30 apiece. He later sold at about $100, but soon regretted the decision and got back in around $200, and is holding on. The electric-car maker’s stock was trading around $315 last week. Regardless of whether Tesla stays public or goes private, it is reaching an inflection point in terms of vehicle sales and gross profit margins, Lippert says. “Tesla will start to generate a small amount of cash flow later next year,” he adds, noting that the company is on track to generate 10% operating margins by 2022.Lippert isn’t the only Baron Capital manager who believes in Tesla’s long-term prospects. Funds the firm manages have significant ownership of the stock, according to Morningstar.Most investors associate health-care innovation with drug discovery, but robotics and advanced optical systems are transforming the operating room. With that secular shift in mind, Lippert added            Intuitive Surgical      (ISRG) to the fund in 2016, when the maker of the da Vinci Surgical System traded at a little over $200 a share. The stock fetched about $540 last week.Hospitals and surgery centers pay about $2 million for the system, which uses robotic arms to assist surgeons in less-invasive procedures. “It’s a great razor and razor-blade business,” says Lippert, noting that more than 70% of revenue is recurring, largely from replacement of disposable instruments used for each patient. The company is steadily adding to the list of procedures that can be performed with the robot, and expanding its geographic reach. As the number of surgeries grows—it’s up 18% this year—so does revenue.

0,"AffiniPay, a payments company, looks like it will continue to be backed by private equity.TA Associates has won an auction for the firm, five people familiar with the matter said. Barron’s reported in December that the business, which produces $30 million a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was up for sale. The company was expected to sell for 20 times Ebitda, Barron’s said in December. Raymond James was advising on the auction. Amy Porter founded AffiniPay in 2005. The Austin, Texas, company provides payments technology for specific industries such as law and accounting. It processes more than $6 billion annually for more than 60,000 users, including the Alabama State Bar, the Louisiana State Bar and the ASPCA. In June, Porter, who was AffiniPay’s CEO, became executive chairman. Tom West took over as CEO, a statement said at the time.Payments companies, which typically process transactions between merchants and customers, have emerged as one of the hottest sectors in financial technology. Last year saw several large payments transactions:            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) bought TSYS for $21.5 billion,            Fiserv      (FISV) acquired First Data for $22 billion, and            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) snapped up WorldPay in a $35 billion deal.            Mastercard      (MA) bought Nets for $3.19 billion in August.More recently,            Visa      (V) agreed in January to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion. Plaid isn’t a payments company but provides the technology to enable consumer payments.TA, of Boston, is a longtime investor in payments companies. The private-equity firm acquired BluePay, a payment processor for merchants, in 2013. Four years later, in 2017, it sold BluePay to First Data for $760 million. TA also invested in BillDesk, an Indian payments company, in 2012, and in Financial Information Technologies, which provides invoicing and electronic payments to alcoholic beverage retailers and distributors, in 2018. Last year, TA’s 13th flagship fund raised $8.5 billion. Great Hill, which sold its stake in AffiniPay, invested in the company in 2015. The private-equity firm recently acquired a majority of One Inc., an insurance payments provider,Barron’s reported Feb. 20. Great Hill is investing out of its seventh growth buyout fund, which closed on $2.5 billion in July.

Indeed, now that the furious macro forecasting is behind us—what the legendary investor and former Roundtable member Peter Lynch once called “weekend worrying”—it’s time for the rubber to meet the road, as five of our panelists give—and defend—their views on specific stocks and other investments.The Roundtable members spend half of their daylong meeting each January proposing stocks, bonds, and funds that they believe will race ahead or fall on their faces, and this year was no different. There was a clutch of compelling picks, some persuasive pans, and even what one of our newest panelists views as a couple of likely 10-baggers. Weighing in this week are Rupal J.

0,"Expect fintech deals, particularly payments, to be a big part of the M&A market in 2020. Last year, three huge mergers—            Fiserv$22 billion acquisition of First Data,            Fidelity National Information Services’s$35 billion buy of WorldPay and            Global Payments      $21.5 billion combination with TSYS—consolidated the payments market. The transactions have already lead to further deal making as the companies look to shed duplicate divisions or old tech. For example, Fiserv in December agreed to sell a 60 percent stake in its investment services business to Motive Partners for about $510 million. Consolidation will likely spur banks in 2020 to hunt for deals, particularly payments companies. Banks have the scale, distribution and balance sheets to become buyers of fintechs this year, according to Mark Palmer and Andrew Harte, analysts with BTIG. The successful IPO of            Bill.com,      which rose more than 60 percent in its first day, may boost this trend, particularly in payments, Palmer and Harte said in a Jan. 2 note. Banks are natural buyers of fintechs but haven’t really taken part in M&A as of yet. That may change in 2020. Big U.S. banks are more likely to buy large financial services companies or payment processors with significant earnings and reasonable multiples, than high-growth disrupters like MoneyLion, Chime or Varo Money that are burning cash, said Steve McLaughlin, founder and CEO of FT Partners. “There is less of a likelihood that banks will buy a highflier due to high valuations and fear of a culture clash, unless some creative structuring can be put into the mix,” he said. Of course, there are always exceptions.            JPMorgan Chase      in July completed its $600 million buy of InstaMed, a health-care payments technology company. Deals like InstaMed are “few and far between,” said McLaughlin, whose FT Partners advised InstaMed on its sale to JP Morgan.There’s also            Bank of America,      which may be on the lookout for payments deals this year. In July, BofA said it was dissolving its joint venture with First Data that handled debit and credit card payments for merchants. BofA plans to build out its own merchant services business, which could include acquisitions. In 2020, look for private equity to remain a strong buyer and seller of fintech companies, particularly payments. Cash-rich strategics will also be searching for deals. Fleetcor and Wex may be acquirers in 2020, the BTIG analysts said. The two firms are seen scooping up smaller, venture-backed companies, the note said. They’re not the only ones. Potential takeout candidates include            ACI Worldwide,i3 Verticals,      and            Repay Holdings,      Palmer and Harte said. Affinipay, backed by Great Hill Partners, is on the block, Barron’s has reported. GTCR has also hired William Blair to handle inbound interest for Paya, the company formerly known as Sage Payment Solutions, PE Hub said. A spokeswoman for BofA declined to comment.

0,"More than 10 years after the financial crisis, the M&A market is on an upswing—and showing few signs of stopping. Expect another good year in 2020, when an improved economic environment and low interest rates are expected to keep the merger market humming along. Not everything is rosy. The number of global announced transactions in 2019 fell 3.7% to 34,482 as of Dec. 19, according to data from Dealogic, down from 35,976 in 2018. Those deals were valued at roughly $4 trillion, a 2.4% dip from last year’s $4.1 trillion.Still, it didn’t feel like a down year to many M&A participants. Christian Atwood, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis, who advises on M&A and private equity transactions, said he was surprised that deal-making activity dropped. “We certainly didn’t feel that,” Atwood said. “Demand for our services was higher than ever, and based on what’s on my desk right now and in the pipeline, I have no reason to think 2020 will be any different.”The slight drop comes at the tail end of a five-year bull run for mergers. Global M&A volume has surpassed $3 trillion in volume each year since 2014, Dealogic said. “The last four years have been terrific,” said Brendan Ryan, a managing director and co-head of Raymond James’s technology and services group.The past year saw an increase in large deals. Many of these transactions, valued at more than $20 billion, were transformative. For example,            London Stock Exchange Group’s      (ticker: LSE.London) $27 billion deal to buy Refinitiv is an attempt to create a data provider to rival Bloomberg. Or            United Technologies’      (UTX) $86 billion agreement to purchase            Raytheon      (RTN) that will produce a $100 billion defense behemoth. Then, there’s the trio of large payments deals that consolidated the fintech market:            Global Payments’      (GPN) $21.5 billion acquisition of TSYS,            Fiserv’s      (FISV) $22 billion purchase of First Data, and            Fidelity National Information Services’      (FIS) $35 billion buy of WorldPay. Technology, particularly software, remained the top sector for deals. Tech M&A produced 10,216 transactions in 2019, valued at $808 billion. Health care came in a distant second with 2,967 deals totaling $580 billion, Dealogic said. Fidelity’s acquisition of WorldPay weighed in as the largest tech deal, while            Bristol-Myers Squibb’s      (BMY) $99 billion buy, including debt, of Celgene was the biggest in the health-care sector.The surging M&A market means sellers can continue to command—and receive—sky-high valuations. Strong software and fintech companies can trade, in the middle market, for 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda), Raymond James’s Ryan said. This compares to 10 to 15 years ago, when the same companies would likely go for midteen multiples, he said.Banking and private-equity executives have been preparing for a crash since the U.S. began clawing out of the last recession in 2009. Yet there are few signs of a downturn. Barring any geopolitical problems with North Korea, Russia, or China, execs remain very positive about M&A in 2020. Many banking and private-equity executives expect a rush to market during the first half of 2020, as sellers seek to get their deals finished before the presidential election. Some think merger activity will begin slowing around September or October, while Ryan thinks a drop off could start in late summer.Not everyone agrees. Atwood, of Kirkland & Ellis, doesn’t think the market will slow down at all in 2020. The first half of the year will continue to be “red-hot” for M&A, he said. If President Donald Trump is reelected, then it’s “business as usual” for mergers, Atwood says. “If Trump is defeated, I think that could actually cause an acceleration in activity due to the risk that changes to the tax code could follow,” he said. Expect private-equity firms to be very active in 2020. Buyout firms have $1.4 trillion of cash that they need to put to work, Preqin says. This figure hits $2.4 trillion if Preqin includes real estate, infrastructure, natural resources and private debt, a spokeswoman said. The pressure to invest, combined with relatively easy financing, will spur private equity to hunt more in the public markets for deals. One example:            KKR’s      (KKR) reported interest in            Walgreens Boots Alliance      (WBA), which is valued at $70 billion. “PE is sitting on enormous dry powder,” Andrew Bednar, a senior partner at Perella Weinberg Partners, says. “People are waiting on that to get deployed and it will get deployed.”That could make 2020 a very happy year for M&A.

0,"Square      shares, long seen as a red-hot growth play, plunged this year as investors worried that the expansion might be cooling off. Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Willi says they may be too concerned. He upgraded the payments company’s stock to Outperform late on Wednesday evening. Square shares were up almost 3% on Thursday morning, although not everyone on Wall Street is convinced. The stock (ticker: SQ) will rise because investors are too pessimistic about the company’s prospects, given that the fundamentals of its business are still strong and its valuation is improving, Willi wrote. Earlier this year, the shares were chugging higher, rising almost 45% ahead of Square’s second-quarter earnings release. But when the numbers came out, the gross volume of payments Square handled came in slightly below expectations and management offered disappointing guidance for third-quarter revenue. The shares fell sharply and are now up 6% in 2019. That negative sentiment is overdone and “most, if not all, concerns are already reflected in SQ’s share price and valuation,” Willi argued. He addressed three areas of concern: slower growth in gross payments volume, the third-quarter financial guidance, and delays in converting Square’s partnership and investment in ticketing service Eventbrite.The key worries that he lists as overblown are gross payments volume deceleration, no guidance raise after the second quarter and delays in fully realizing the financial benefit of Square’s partnership with the ticketing service Eventbrite.“Given Square’s size, it is only reasonable to assume gross payments volume growth will moderate; although the second quarter moderation was more than expected,” Willi wrote. He also expects the company to offer more information about the outlook after it completes the sale of the food-delivery startup Caviar to DoorDash. The $410 million deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.Eventually, he said, Eventbrite will help to stabilize growth in gross payments volume, and may even cause it to gain speed. Willi believes that sentiment among investors is about to shift, sending the stock higher again, but Evercore ISI’s Rayna Kumar is less upbeat. On Tuesday, she dug into new pricing terms Square disclosed, and reiterated her bearish take on the shares.The thrust of the company’s new pricing, Kumar notes, is an attempt to gain market share among larger merchants, where Square has been less strong than with smaller businesses.“At first glance, Square’s pricing change appears to be a price reduction,” she wrote. “In fact, Square appears to be raising prices for small merchants to fund a price cut for larger merchants.”While it makes sense for Square to try and expand market share in a category where it has been weak, there is a lot of competition for the business of larger merchants form companies like Stripe, Clover and            Shopify,      as well as traditional payments companies like            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) and the soon-to-be-combined            Global Payments      and TSYS.A bigger rival,            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM), is setting its sights on a chunk of Square’s business. America’s largest bank by assets is rolling out free same-day deposits for merchants on its WePay platform who have a Chase bank account.The bull case on Squares requires that the company not only gain ground in an area where it hasn’t had its greatest success, but also that it defend its market share from what appears to be a newly energized banking behemoth. That will be a difficult path.

1,"Three numbers to start your day:The deal is part of an M&A boom in the payments industry. Recently, there have been two other mergers in the industry—those were valued at more than 50 billion dollars. The payments industry has taken off, as credit and debit card usage keeps rising. Providing all the services to make card-purchases happen is an incredibly profitable business—and the companies are betting that the bigger they get, the more profitable it can be. —to remain eligible for wholesale orders from Amazon, according to Bloomberg. The online retail giant has previously filled some of its orders by buying wholesale goods from independent sellers before then selling those items directly to consumers. Now, smaller vendors won’t be able to sell wholesale to Amazon. Instead, they’ll have to compete for each retail order on Amazon’s website. The decision seems to come down to Amazon wanting to lower costs and maintain tighter control over its vendors. It could, however, upend thousands of small businesses who had come to depend on Amazon’s business. The yield on 10-year notes also fell below three month Treasuries. That’s known as a “yield curve inversion,” and if it lasts long enough, it can be an indication that investors think a recession is coming.It seems that stock market investors may finally be picking up on the bond market’s negative signs. All three major indexes traded down on Tuesday after the bond market inverted.  Numbers by Barron’s is a new daily podcast. Find out more here.This episode was hosted by Ben Walsh.

0,"The payments M&A boom keeps rolling on, with            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) and          Total Systems Services      (TSS) announcing a merger of equals Tuesday morning.The all-stock deal values Total Systems Services, known as TSYS, at $119.86 per share, or a 20% premium to the company’s stock price before talks between the two companies were reported. Global Payments shareholders will own 52% of the new company, and TSYS shareholders will own 48%. The deal, which the companies expect to close by the fourth quarter of 2019, “creates the pre-eminent pure play payments technology company globally with extensive scale and really unmatched reach,” Global Payments CFO Cameron Bready told Barron’s on Tuesday. “That’s the fundamental industrial logic of putting the two companies together.”  Read our latest cover story: Big Tech Wanted to Dethrone Credit Cards. Why It Failed, and Who Wins Now. There have been two big payments deals already this year. In March,            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) agreed to a $34 billion deal for Worldpay (WP), and in January,            Fiserv      (FISV) bought          First Data      (FDC) for $22 billion.The flurry of recent transactions in the payments space is proof, Bready said, that “now more than ever, scale matters in our business.” Investors who had anticipated the next deal in the wave of payments industry consolidation helped push Global Payments stock up more than 49% and TSYS stock up 34% before the merger talks were first reported. What sets the planned combination of Global Payments and TSYS apart is that the newly created company will be a payments company, without adjacent businesses to distract the company’s strategy or siphon off investment dollars, Bready said.While cost cuts are “a part of any of deal of this nature,” Bready said incremental revenue growth is the driving factor behind the deal. The new company will, for instance, be able to sell more products and services to its more than 2 million small and medium business customers in the U.S., he said.Bready expects the combined company will grow annual revenue between the 9% and 11% that Global Payments has historically targeted and will aim for between 16% and 18% earnings growth.Bready expects that the new company expects its debt to be rated investment grade and that, Bready said, will allow its to invest more in new technology and further partnerships and acquisitions.

0,"Square was one of 2018’s hottest stocks, but things got ugly last fall when shares of the financial-technology company were nearly cut in half as investors worried about rising interest rates and suddenly pricey stocks. After jumping 186% in the first nine months of the year,            Square      (ticker: SQ) tumbled 50% by the market’s low on Christmas Eve. The shares have regained much of their losses since then, but at a recent $77, they’re still 23% below the September 2018 high. The swings match those at a a company that has made big changes to its focus and business model in the years since it went public in 2015. Square, co-founded and still run by Jack Dorsey, was among the first to see an opportunity in helping underserved small businesses accept credit-card payments. Its smartphone- and tablet-connected dongles made it easier to bring new stores into the world and arguably leveled the playing field a bit between e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar outlets.  But that business never got investors all that excited. And there was a limit to the market opportunity. In recent years, Square has plunged deeper into small-business lending, experimented with cryptocurrencies, and expanded into software. Those areas looked attractive when markets were roaring, but as investors’ risk appetites faded, they became less forgiving of Square’s costly growth efforts. Without adjusting for share-based compensation, Square has yet to turn an annual profit, and Wall Street analysts don’t expect to see one before next year. The debate over Square rages, even as the market recovers, and it was in full roar after the company’ released its most recent earnings report late last month. Square posted adjusted revenue of $464 million and adjusted earnings of 14 cents a share, both slightly ahead of expectations. But it fell a hair short in payment volume, at $23 billion, marking the first time it had missed the consensus view in 13 quarters as a public company. Payment volume is a key stat, representing the total dollar amount of card payments that flow through Square’s seller platform and peer-to-peer offering. It’s considered a proxy for Square’s importance to customers.Square also forecast a sharp deceleration in annual revenue growth and gave a disappointing first-quarter earnings outlook. Its shares initially fell on the weak forecast, but ended up on the first day of trading after the report.That’s a good sign for bulls. But for the skeptics, it’s more of a reason to wonder if the market has a grasp on Square’s risks. In question is whether a hardware company like Square can leave its roots behind and become part-software provider, part-bank—or if that should even be a goal. MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis, who rates Square Neutral, with a $77 price target, thinks the company should refocus on its big money maker—transaction processing—which accounts for the bulk of overall revenue. This core business “is getting a little ignored right now,” Ellis tells Barron’s. Square continues to roll out sleek payment terminals, but Ellis argues that it isn’t putting enough effort into selling them to new customers. Square seems particularly focused on its peer-to-peer Cash app, which is meant to be used in lieu of traditional checking accounts and debit cards. Square is currently offering incentives—including a 10% discount at            Chipotle Mexican Grill﻿      (CMG)—to customers who pay with the app,.A Square spokeswoman pointed to Dorsey’s comments on the earnings call: “I believe the ecosystem is extremely sticky because it builds durable relationships.”It’s “counterintuitive” to Ellis that Square’s transaction and volume growth are slowing, because Square recently introduced fancy hardware offerings. Part of the problem might be that Square remains too focused on growing its customer base through self-discovery, rather than with a sizable sales force. That do-it-yourself strategy may have worked in Square’s early days of selling to tiny coffee shops, but as the company moves upmarket to larger customers, it’s going up against established competitors like          First Data      (FDC) and            Global Payments      (GPN). By getting its terminals into the hands of more merchants, Square could get back on the path of big “beat-and-raise” quarters, Ellis says, a pattern that has helped propel its shares up nearly nine times from a November 2015 initial-public-offering price of $9. Square has exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for adjusted earnings per share in each of the past 10 quarters, but the latest three months marked the first time in that stretch that Square didn’t beat by a double-digit percentage.Expanding the merchant base would give Square more potential customers for its high-margin software, including tools that let small businesses electronically manage payroll, invoicing, and marketing. These businesses sit within Square’s subscription-and-services segment, along with Caviar food delivery and the Capital lending program for merchants. The segment grew 134% last year. Software remains a small part of the overall business, but Square’s stock already fetches an enterprise-software-like multiple. It trades at a whopping 95 times forward earnings estimates, about in line with the 108 times for            Workday      (WDAY), which makes finance and human-resources software.            Mastercard      (MA) and            Visa      (V) trade for roughly 30 times, while            American Express      (AXP) is at just 14. That multiple difference may explain why Square seems more motivated about its high-margin software, perhaps even at the expense of its legacy business. Fintech is a catchy term, but profitably combining the categories will require striking a tricky balance.  Email:  editors@barrons.com Square was one of 2018’s hottest stocks, but things got ugly last fall when shares of the financial-technology company were nearly cut in half as investors worried about rising interest rates and suddenly pricey stocks.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Who says active management is dead?Since 2004, Buffalo, N.Y.-based Sandhill Investment Management, an independent investment advisor led by Edwin “Tim” Johnston, has quietly churned out market-beating numbers. Its Concentrated Equity Alpha portfolio, which owns just 25 to 30 stocks, has returned an eye-popping 279.4% since its March 2004 inception, versus 133.5% for the Standard & Poor’s 500—and that’s after fees. In 2017, the portfolio—which requires a minimum $250,000 investment—was up 33%, versus 19.4% for the index. Johnston moved back to his hometown of Buffalo after getting his M.B.A. at Boston University. After working as director of research at a large local investment firm, he started an investment advisory business for a local brokerage, which was spun out a couple of years later as Sandhill. The firm’s official beginnings in 2004 were humble: It was funded by a $150,000 check from Johnston’s personal account, and located in a nondescript office park. Its name was inspired by a visit to Ontario, where Johnston, an avid hunter, was sitting in a duck blind when a sandhill crane flew over. Today, the firm oversees $1.1 billion in assets in its four main products, which, in addition to its Concentrated Equity Alpha portfolio, include large-cap yield, corporate bond, and balanced portfolios.“The reason people want to be in the stock market is because it’s a dynamic game,” says Johnston, who, along with his investment-team colleagues—Rick Ryskalczyk, Mark Larry, and Aaron VandeGuchte—is a keen reader of company information. “A third of the stock market’s capitalization in 25 years doesn’t exist today, and that’s true. Peeling the artichoke and getting to what really works in a dynamic environment is, after all these years, absolutely fascinating and fun.” To learn how Johnston picks stocks—and which ones he likes now—keep reading.   Barron’s: Why a concentrated portfolio?  Johnston: You get paid to concentrate in the equity markets. The average mutual fund has over 100 stocks. Why do you want to revert to the mean? We are multicap. Restricting yourself by market capitalization makes no sense. We do our homework. When we get interested in a company, our team builds a file. My favorite piece of reading in the evening is the 30-page earnings call transcript. We’ll also read the 10-Ks, the 10-Qs. We don’t depend heavily on Wall Street research. We discuss whether the company has a structural economic advantage it can exploit for a long period of time. Then we call the company. We usually won’t buy it unless we talk to the CEO, CFO, or investor-relations person in-depth, at least once if not twice. Our due diligence process lasts between two weeks and a month. We know exactly what we’re looking for: companies with structural advantages and hidden earnings power that haven’t been recognized by the market. I listen to a lot of conference calls. A great outcome has a very high correlation with a great CEO. We’ll pay up but have to think that with the earnings power, the stock is still a bargain. I would rather own world-class companies than say, “Gee, this is really cheap, so there is a margin of safety.” I’m very wary of value traps.  Q: Are there still opportunities in this market?  A: Passive investing has obviously taken off in the past decade because 80% of active managers, roughly, underperform over long periods of time. The active managers set the prices. When people want to leave those index funds, there will be forced selling. That will create disorder. We love that environment. Q: Disorder may continue if the market continues to worry about protectionism. What is your market view?  A: It’s a tenuous environment. Right now the largest economies are in sync. That’s a positive, but that’s been baked into the market. You are seeing substantial increases to estimates. But you also have rates being normalized. We’re getting to the point where bonds will start to compete for capital. A company is worth the present value of its future cash flows, but the discount rate is going up, and that makes those cash flows worth less. The corporate tax cut has been tremendous rocket fuel. The year-over-year comparisons will look fabulous all through 2018. But that’s a one-time shot. And then we’ll go back to normal earnings. So rising P/Es, rising rates, plus the fact that we’re nine years into an upcycle—all of that makes me nervous. I also think the fiscal stimulus combined with a corporate tax cut is a real mistake. This could be problematic three to five years out. You’d have to either hyper-inflate or not pay your bills. That is dangerous. Q: Why do you keep positions as long as you do? For example, you’ve owned            Adobe Systems      ticker: ADBE since 2011.  A: It takes time to build value. We bought Adobe at an average price of $27 a share when they said revenues would go down. As of Tuesday, it was trading at $210. It was the market leader and had fabulous recurring revenue. If you sell a stock every time it gets fully valued, you are never going to get anywhere. If you had sold            Microsoft      MSFT every time it got expensive in its first decade as a public company, you would have been horribly sorry. We feel the same about Adobe. As of March 2, 2018  Source: Sandhill Investment ManagementWe look to see if other companies can successfully make inroads into their franchise. To date, we haven’t recognized anybody. We are not going to hand a client a capital gain or get rid of a world class asset until A, it’s ridiculously overvalued, or B, the thesis is no longer intact. Q: What’s your investment thesis for            Bio-Techne      TECH?  A: We value stocks on “owner earnings,” which is a Warren Buffett expression—it’s operating cash flow less any changes in working capital minus maintenance capital expenditures. We don’t care so much about GAAP or non-GAAP earnings. Chuck Kummeth, the CEO, was appointed in 2013. He took a sleepy high-margin business and reinvigorated it through acquisitions. Bio-Techne has three divisions: biotech, which sells proteins, antibodies, and reagents out of the freezer and is 65% of revenue; protein platforms, which sells instruments that drive the use of the biotech; and a diagnostics division that sells equipment to companies like            Thermo Fisher Scientific      TMO and            Abbott Laboratories      ABT. Bio-Techne acquired a company called Advanced Cellular Diagnostics, whose top line is growing 40% to 50%. If you have cancer, the tumor expresses proteins. Current diagnostic tests introduce an antibody which binds with a protein that was expressed by the tumor. The current test is 75% accurate. Advanced Cellular’s test instead searches for a specific gene or gene fragment of the tumor. It is 95% accurate. They didn’t know quite what they had when they bought it. This has been a large upside surprise. They have very strong patent protection on the probes that look at that gene and the gene fragment. The run rate on Advanced Cellular’s revenues is about $50 million—a little less than 10% of Bio-Techne’s projected $635 million in revenue. It’s growing 50%. If you compound 50%, you get big numbers pretty quickly. Bio-Techne is highly profitable. Earnings should grow 15% a year going forward. Given the recurring nature of their revenue, consistency of earnings, the possibility of more accretive acquisitions, and the Advanced Cellular potential, it should hold its mid-30s multiple to owner earnings. We estimate owner earnings per share of $5.74 for fiscal 2020 and have a price target of $195 per share by mid-year 2019. The stock currently trades at $144. Q: What do you like about            CoStar Group      CSGP?  A: It’s an incredibly cool company. It is the leading provider of critical-information services to the real estate market, including building information, location, tenants, when leases are expiring, and sales listings. It is the Bloomberg of the real estate market. It was founded in 1987 by Andy Florence, and it has a couple of decades of data. Furthermore, their nearest competitor just filed for liquidation. When you start to build businesses to scale and you get structural margin, people can’t compete with you. They bought Apartments.com and ForRent.com. They have pricing power. They have incredible roadway regarding margins. Operating margin in 2017 was 29%. In 2018, they are targeting 31%. Their long-term operating-margin goal is 40%. So it’s a virtuous world: Rising revenues of a recurring nature, and margins that increase over time. The stock is at $357. CoStar is expected to earn $7.15 a share this year on revenues of $1.2 billion. It has a market cap of $12.9 billion. Owner earnings are $258 million. So it’s trading at 45 times earnings. For fiscal 2018, revenue is supposed to grow 22% and owner earnings 56%. They are making about $7.15 a share now. We expect 2020 owner earnings per share of $12.30. The multiple will contract to 35 as the company matures. It will have $900 million of net cash in 2020, which gets you to a stock price of $455 by the end of 2019.  Q: Finally, what’s the investment case for            Global Payments      GPN?  A: Global Payments is a merchant acquirer a financial institution that processes card payments for merchants. It is run by Jeff Sloan, one of the smartest people we’ve ever followed, an ex-Goldman guy who became CEO when he was 42. We got interested in the story when Global had No. 8 market share in North America. Then they purchased Heartland, which had No. 9 share, and created a company that was the 6th-largest merchant acquirer. The story really came together as they got scale. Then they created vertical specific software with analytics specific for the customers, helping them grow the business. They aren’t chasing            Walmart      WMT; they’re really looking after small and medium-size businesses. We really like their geographic diversity: 19% of revenue is from Europe and 8% from Asia/Pacific, both areas which are growing. This is a recurring-revenue and getting-to-scale story. And this is not a small revenue base. Global Payments will probably have $3.9 billion in revenue for 2018, $5.05 a share in non-GAAP earnings and $4.52 in owner earnings. The equity market cap is $18.1 billion and enterprise value is $21.3 billion. It is calling for operating margin growth of 110 basis points in 2018, and 75 basis points for both 2019 and 2020. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. We bought the stock at $76.60. It is currently at $114. We think the multiple will contract slightly to 28 times owner earnings. We estimate owner earnings of $6.19 per share in 2020 and debt remaining constant. This yields a price of $153 by year-end 2019. Q: Thanks, Tim.   Comments?

0,"“Coronavirus” isn’t the only term that Americans are typing into their Google search boxes these days. “Unemployment” and “recession” are trending, too. In the first 20 days of March,            Alphabet’s      Google searches for “unemployment” far exceeded their volume for all of July 2010, when the U.S. jobless rate ran at 9.5%. And Google Trends data on “recession” was almost double what it was in any month during the financial crisis’s peak fall 2008-spring 2009 period.These trending searches anticipated awful economic data. Last week’s U.S. unemployment-insurance claims hit a record high of 3.28 million, up from 220,000 two weeks earlier. Some economists forecast as much as a 30% drop in second-quarter gross domestic product. Meanwhile, locked-down Americans are changing how they work and play. Searches for “work from home” tripled from December to March, to their highest level ever. Searches for “videoconferencing” also spiked in recent weeks, as more companies told employees to work from home to limit Covid-19’s spread. In fact, as the rest of the stock market sold off, shares of companies such as            Zoom Video Communications      and            Slack Technologies      have soared. And Google searches for delivery services also have surged, along with shares of            Amazon.com, online pet store            Chewy, and other retailers with delivery capabilities. Of course, lots of companies are losing out in the pandemic. Google searches in the U.S. for “cancel flight” and “cancel cruise” soared in early March to more than 20 times their volume a month earlier, just as the airline stocks plunged 50% or more and cruise lines sank 75% for the year. “Bailout” anyone?

All Rights ReservedDell Technologies      and its majority-owned subsidiary            VMware      have both withdrawn their financial guidance, citing uncertainties about their businesses created by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Both companies made their announcements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Dell (ticker: DELL) said in its filing that it is seeing “heightened interest in work from home solutions and continuing execution in its global supply chain, and remains confident in its liquidity position,” but that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operations for the current fiscal year.” Dell had previously projected revenue for its February 2021 fiscal year of $92 billion to $95 billion, with profits of $5.90 to $6 a share. At the time, Dell said the outlook didn’t reflect any potential impact from the virus.Likewise, VMware (VMW) said in its own SEC filing that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operation,” and therefore it is withdrawing its previous guidance for both the May quarter and the February 2021 fiscal year. The company’s previous guidance had been for full-year revenue of $12.05 billion, with May-quarter revenues of $2.73 billion.On Thursday, PC-related stocks got a boost from some bullish comments after the close on Wednesday from memory chip company            Micron Technology      (MU), which said that it was seeing a boost in demand from strong PC sales as more people upgrade their systems to handle extended periods of working and studying from home. Dell’s announcement removes some of the shine from yesterday’s optimism.Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong points out in a research note Friday that while many semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have withdrawn guidance in recent weeks, many hardware companies have not, such as            HP Inc.      (HPQ),            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Lenovo Group      (0992.Hong Kong), and            Pure Storage      (PSTG). His conclusion is that the announcement “was not entirely unexpected given market conditions.” But Ong still likes Dell shares, asserting that the company has “several underappreciated offsets,” including market share gains, downside protection given a low valuation, and deleveraging potential.

0,"Add servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

0,"Tech investors need to brace for rough seas. That’s the underlying message in a new note from Citi analyst Jim Suva, who has cut his estimates for all 30 companies he covers, cutting price targets on many and reducing ratings on a few. The impact of the coronavirus, he now fears, will be worse than he had anticipated.In the early days of the outbreak, the focus for the technology hardware sector was the disruption of the supply chain, as China-based component providers and contract electronics manufacturers closed down for multiple weeks. Companies like            Apple      (AAPL),            Dell Technologies      (DELL),            HP Inc.      (HPQ) and many others acknowledged that they faced near-term supply disruption, as well as short-run demand issues in China. But the overall view was that demand issues would be transient—orders delayed rather than orders lost for good. Suva now believes that was wishful thinking. In a new 220-page report, Suva says that the Street has been underestimating the demand-side issues created by the coronavirus and the rapid shutdown of normal global business. In a research note published late Friday, Suva cut his estimates for all the companies in his coverage universe: PC and networking hardware vendors, consumer-devices companies, electronics distributors, and disk-drive companies. None was spared. He cut ratings on four companies:            Hewlett Packard Enterprise       (HPE) to Sell from Neutral,            GoPro      (GPRO) to Sell from Neutral,            Infinera      (INFN) to Sell from Neutral, and            CommScope Holding      (COMM) to Neutral from Buy.Even for the stocks he still recommends, Suva is reducing his expectations. For instance, while he kept a Buy rating on Apple shares, he chopped his price target to $310, from $375, while trimming his EPS estimates for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years to below current consensus levels.Suva noted that in all cases, he is reducing his estimates below the most recent guidance from the companies, “given the elongated resolution of the coronavirus and the ripple economic effect associated with the global nature.” He predicts that in the weeks ahead, many IT hardware and telecom equipment companies will issue negative preannouncements.“To be fair, this is not due to company performance or operations but rather due to the coronavirus, which will materially impact the tech supply chain and end demand which we view as actual demand declines and the shortfalls will not be recouped later in the year,” Suva wrote. “Our view is the recent valuation multiple compression is not short term but rather the new norm for a U-shaped demand bottom which will be slow and gradual.”Suva previously trimmed estimates on the companies in his universe to reflect the impact of the virus, but he is now convinced that he didn’t cut far enough.“Our original cuts were under the view that the virus would be more contained, shorter lived and the demand impact would be more of a push out and this demand softness would be recouped as 2020 progressed,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, the reality is the virus is having a prolonged duration and global reach with an impact across most industries and end markets. While we are encouraged by some positive signs of parts of China returning to normal business operations ... we note this has taken longer than anticipated.”To make his estimate adjustments, he included the assumption that growth in global gross domestic product in 2020 will be reduced by a full percentage point, to 1.5%, a point below the last World Bank estimate of 2.5%.He sees the auto sector down 5%, worse than his previous estimate of down 3%, with consumer electronics flat, rather up 2%. “Yes, we expect investors to push back saying much of this will be recaptured later in 2020, but we do not believe this demand will come back,” he writes. “Accordingly, our sales and EPS adjustments impact cascades beyond the current quarter and impact all of 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 ... We do not believe demand will bounce back as both consumers and enterprises adjust to a new norm of using technology longer and working more remotely as well as we see a broad based employment hiring pause.” Write to Eric J.

0,"HP Inc.      CEO Enrique Lores has had a remarkably eventful first few months as the company’s CEO. Since replacing Dion Weisler in the top job last August, the company has struggled through demand issues with its crucial print supply business, launched a new business model for printers, maneuvered through a microprocessor shortage, and dealt with the fallout from the rapid spread of coronavirus which has disrupted the companies supply chain. And, of course, Lores has been at the forefront as HP (ticker: HPQ) battles a hostile tender offer and proxy fight by            Xerox Holdings      (XRX), a company a fraction of HP’s size.A native of Madrid with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic University of Valencia and an M.B.A. from Esade Business School in Barcelona, Lores has been with HP since joining as an intern in 1989. Before his recent ascent to the top spot, he ran the company’s printing business, steering the company’s 2017 acquisition of            Samsung Electronics      ’ (005930.Korea) printing business. He also played a key role in the separation of the old Hewlett-Packard into two separate companies: HP Inc. and            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE).  Barron’s recently sat down for a chat with Lores in the company’s historic HP Laboratories building in Palo Alto, Calif., where the old offices of founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard are still preserved for posterity—and where the company’s engineers continue to develop new tech printing and PC technologies. Among other things, Lores discussed why HP is so opposed to the Xerox bid—and why HP might want to turn around and buy Xerox.   Barron’s: Enrique, let’s start with Xerox. You’ve repeatedly rejected their takeover bid as too low. But you’ve also said you see value in consolidating the printing business and that you’re willing to talk to Xerox about potential deals. Given they’re unlikely to raise their offer, that suggests you might want to buy Xerox. Can you explain your thinking?  Lores: When we look at the print market, especially in the office space, we don’t see significant growth going forward. But there are many competitors—and there is going to be consolidation. And when you drive consolidation by reducing costs, you create value. Three years ago, we bought the Samsung printing business. We drove consolidation and created value. It was a money-losing unit before we bought it and profitable the first year after the deal closed. That deal helped accelerate our growth in managed print services. With Xerox, the problem we have is with the deal on the table. It doesn’t create value for our shareholders.  Remind us why you said no. First, the price they’re offering doesn’t recognize the stand-alone value this company has. The second problem is the high leverage the combined company would have, which we consider extremely risky. Third is that the synergies they’re using to calculate the value of the deal are unrealistic. They count cost savings we’re already finding as a stand-alone company.  So what if HP turned around and bought Xerox? Hold on. There are three questions that need to be addressed first. How do we get to the right value exchange between the two companies? How do we create an entity with the right capital structure? And how do we align on a realistic set of assumptions for synergies? That’s the first conversation. How the companies get together, who buys whom—there are many ways of doing that, but we don’t think it should be the first conversation. You don’t actually compete with Xerox much, do you? The overlap is small. We’re a $60 billion company. About $40 billion of that is PCs, with zero overlap. Of the remaining $20 billion, about half is consumer printers, with zero overlap. Of the rest, we do about $2.8 billion in managed print services, which is where we compete. They’re about a $9 billion business. That’s why when they say there are $2 billion in synergies, out of a combined $12 billion in business—well, that would be a miracle. If you bought them, where would the value be? We see an opportunity to drive costs down. We are investing in R&D, we both invest in marketing. We estimate the cost synergies are around $1 billion. It would also give us a larger presence in managed print services.  But you repeatedly have said you have other options. Our priority is to execute our plan, which is going to create a lot of value for shareholders. We are open to exploring consolidation, but there are other opportunities we’re considering from an M&A perspective.  When you say other opportunities, are you talking about other printing deals? Or might you do something on the PC side? Both. There are opportunities in the print market. There are opportunities in the personal systems market. Some might involve consolidation, others might be about expanding into other segments. There are opportunities in graphics printing and industrial printing. There are opportunities in 3-D printing. Is Xerox open to the possibility of you buying them? We have talked, but I don’t see value in sharing the discussions we’ve had in public.  What are you hearing from your institutional holders about the Xerox offer and about your own plan, which includes a large stock buyback and cost-cutting measures? We presented our plan a few weeks ago, and since then we’ve spent a lot of time sharing, discussing, and explaining the plan. The response has been very positive. Investors understand how we plan to manage the company, and they like the amount of capital to be returned. Have you also been in contact with Carl Icahn, who is the largest Xerox holder and also holds a 4% stake in HP? We regularly talk to all of our key shareholders. He’s one. But we won’t talk about the specific conversations, not with him or with any others.  One of your biggest operating issues in recent quarters has been decreasing revenue from ink and toner. What are you doing to fix that issue? It’s an opportunity to become more profitable. If you look at our installed base, we lose money with 25% of our customers who buy a printer and either don’t print enough or don’t use HP supplies. We have a plan in place to address the issue. What’s the plan? The first thing is to shift from a transactional model to a subscription model. With the new model, we monitor the amount of ink in your printer and before you run out, we send you a new cartridge. You pay us a fixed fee per month. The model is very attractive for consumers—it addresses the two big problems consumers have. The first problem is running out of ink. The second is printing is too expensive. Your cost per page goes down by up to 70%.  Is that program fully rolled out? We already have 6 million subscribers, and the program is growing fast. In the U.S., 20% of customers who buy a printer end up as subscribers.  How are the third-party suppliers fighting back?  We’re seeing some retailers offering “replenishment models.” The difference with our program is that we get data directly from the printer, so we know exactly what you need. We know exactly when the printer is going to run out of ink. Also, the cartridges we use are bigger. The overall cost of our model is significantly lower. How does the hardware price vary if you pay for ink with a subscription? No change. The difference is that we’ll send you ink cartridges before you run out. You can drop from the program at any point, but the retention rate is in the high 90s. Customers love the program because it addresses a key problem—they don’t need to buy cartridges anymore, and the cost of printing is cheaper. Will most consumers adopt that model? We think 40% to 50% of customers will subscribe. The percentages will grow because that’s the way more and more consumers want to buy. But you are taking an alternative approach in emerging markets. Right. In those markets, the printer comes with a very big reservoir of ink or toner, which, depending your consumption rate, could last a year, two years, three years. That’s a change in our model, and those printers are profitable. The average life of a printer is three to five years. In many cases, you might choose to buy a new printer. But we also have the ability to refill the ink. You’ve also announced a shift in your business model for retail customers.  Yes, we’re adopting a model that looks like the one mobile phones used to have. We’re going to offer two options. One we call an end-to-end system, which will only work with HP supplies. The price of the hardware will be similar to where it is today. We’ll also offer a flexible system, which will work with supplies from other companies, and the hardware price will be higher.  And you are going to start doing that at the end of 2020. Yes. It will take almost two years to change the whole portfolio to this model. The important thing is the print business will be in much better shape as we drive these transitions. For the personal-systems business—the PC business—there have been some positive dynamics over the past year. The Windows 10 refresh cycle has driven demand, and memory chip pricing has been soft. And then there has been a tight supply of microprocessors. In the January quarter, you had your highest operating margins in the PC business in many years. But that’s not sustainable, is it? The PC business is more than 60% of revenue and close to 50% of profits. It’s a critical business for us. In recent years, we’ve been able to outgrow the market in revenue, units, and profits. We have been growing and improving profitability, driven by the innovation we bring to market, the experiences we create, and the scale we have. But what happens with margins? And growth? We’re confident in our ability to continue to grow the business at or above the market pace. When we look at the overall PC market, the expectation from analysts is that it will grow around 4% for the next three to five years in revenue. In the segments where we operate, which are not growing as fast, growth is 1% to 1.2%, and we should grow at or above that rate. In terms of margins, you’re right that the margins we have now are the best in a long time. Our long-term projection is for margins between 3.5% and 5.5%. So in the latest quarter, we were one full point above the top of the long-term range. We think at the end of the year we will be within the target range. Let’s discuss these component supply and demand issues. The component issues are extending the life of the Windows refresh, by not having enough processors, and now because of the implications of the coronavirus. We expect to see very solid growth in this business just driven by these changes. On top of that, there is a large installed base of PCs that are older than four or five years, hundreds of millions of units that will eventually be replaced.  You raised this notion about M&A in personal systems. What’s your thinking there? We’ve always said any transaction needs to be supported by three things. It needs to be aligned to the strategies we have explained. It needs to have a solid financial case. And we need to have an execution plan that will support the financial gains. If I apply those filters to personal systems, we have said that we see opportunities to grow in certain verticals where margins are better—for example, retail point-of-sale systems, where we are the leaders in the market. We have said we want to grow in the services category. We have said we want to grow in the accessories category. We have said we want to grow in specific premium categories. There could open opportunities to use M&A to complement our position.  Give us a brief update on how 3-D printing is going. It’s a fantastic opportunity. We are leveraging technologies that we have built for years. There are opportunities in automotive, in aeronautics, in the medical space. At the same time, though, we are talking about transforming large industries, and that takes time. But once it happens, it scales. And it is very sticky. That’s why we decided that this strategy for the company is to focus on real manufacturing opportunities. And we are actually making good progress in working with some of the largest manufacturing partners to use our technology to grow into this category.  I used to see the opportunity in printing replacement parts. But you see this as a primary production technology. The value of 3-D printing is not only in aftermarket parts. It is in designing parts that will be created with 3-D printing, because you can create structures that are more complicated, structures that with traditional modern methods cannot be built, but that have better physical performance. For example, something really important for cars going forward is weight, especially as we go to electric cars. With 3-D printing you can create much lighter parts. You can design a part of that because the same physical performance but significantly less weight.  How far is this from being material to your financial results?  It’s a great long-term opportunity, but it won’t be material for a few years.  Finally, how has HP been affected by the coronavirus so far? After the Chinese New Year, production didn’t restart at the pace it usually does. But it has been recovering. Clearly there has been an impact in terms of the products that we will have in the short term to sell. It’s a supply problem, not demand. Are you through the worst of it? In China, yes. But the situation is fluid. We have seen steady progress, with factories coming up to speed in alignment with a plan that we had two weeks ago. It has not gotten worse.  Is the impact spread across your business?  Yes. It’s an issue for print hardware, PCs, and printer suppliers. We were already having product shortages because of processors, and we have customers not getting the products they want. But that’s the situation we’ve already been in.  And what about demand? If anything, PC demand is stronger than we were expecting. As many companies launch their business-continuity programs, they need their employees to have PCs to work from home. In many cases, they had desktops, and now companies are offering them notebooks.  Enrique, thanks so much.  Write to Eric J.

0,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise      shares were lower in aftermarket trading Tuesday on softer-than-expected revenue for the company’s fiscal first quarter.For the quarter ended Jan. 31, the enterprise technology hardware and services company (ticker: HPE) reported revenue of $6.9 billion, down 8% from a year earlier, and below the Street consensus at $7.2 billion. Non-GAAP profit was 44 cent a share, within the guidance range of 42 to 46 cents, and in line with Street estimates. For the fiscal year ending in October 2020, the company continues to see profit of $1.78 to $1.94 a share on a non-GAAP basis, or $1.01 to $1.17 on a GAAP basis. The company now sees free cash flow for the year of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, down from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion previously, reflecting “current supply chain disruption impacting short-term cash conversion cycles.” The company didn’t provide guidance for the current quarter.It was a rough first quarter for the company’s computer segment, with revenue down 15%—consistent with the 19% decline in the quarter for rival Dell’s enterprise computing segment. Revenue was up 4% in the company’s “intelligent edge” business, up 6% in high-performance computing and mission-critical systems, down 7% in storage, down 6% in financial services and flat in advisory and professional services.CEO Antonio Neri said the company was “disappointed with revenue” in the quarter, which was lower than anticipated largely because of the computer segment, which was hurt by a combination of macro softness and supply-chain disruption.Neri noted that the company didn’t provide guidance for the quarter ending in April because it wouldn’t be appropriate given the uncertainties around the impact of coronavirus on the company’s supply chain.HP Enterprise shares were down 5.8% to $11.86 around 5:15 p.m. Eastern time.

0,"Three numbers to start your day:—that’s based on the companies that have reported so far. We’re almost done with fourth-quarter earnings season, but some major names are still left to report.Each earnings season, retailers tend to be among the last companies to go. Several release their results from the crucial holiday-period this week. They include            Target      (TGT) and Nordstrom (JWN) on Tuesday,            Dollar Tree      (DT) on Wednesday, and            Costco Wholesale      (COST) on Thursday.There are also plenty of earnings highlights among non-retail names.            Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)      goes on Tuesday. On Wednesday,            Campbell Soup      (CPB) and Zoom Video (ZM) report. And finally,            Kroger      (KR) releases its results on Thursday.On Friday it was up over 20% from its yield a week earlier. Plenty of dividend stocks are looking mighty attractive today, but there’s more to the story.The significantly higher yield isn’t because the oil giant just increased its payout. It’s a result of how far and fast Exxon’s stock (XOM) tumbled in last week’s market selloff.Remember, a stock’s dividend yield is its payout per share divided by its stock price. So when the denominator gets smaller, the calculated yield is larger.That’s exactly what happened to almost every dividend-paying stock last week. But if coronavirus disruptions force companies to cut their payouts as some investors fear, those high yields could disappear fast.Through those programs, the companies invested in about half of venture deals done last year—worth over $57 billion.SoftBank Group’s      (SFTBY) $100 billion Vision Fund is definitely the most famous example. But companies from            Starbucks      (SBUX), to            Toyota Motor      (TM), to State Farm all have venture divisions.They have several motivations to invest in venture deals. Some companies want to get in on hot new trends, like            Tyson Foods      ’ (TSN) investment in            Beyond Meat      (BYND). Others just want a look under the hood before acquiring outright—as            Visa      (V) did with fintech company Plaid. Finally, some companies look for products they can use to improve their own business—            JetBlue Airways      (JBLU) invested in an AI start-up to use their technology to improve its ticket pricing.

1,"Apple’s      warning Monday that it will miss March-quarter guidance due to coronavirus-related supply-chain and sales issues in China raises an obvious question: What other companies are vulnerable to the same conditions?On the supply side, there are obvious implications for anyone that sources hardware from China-based contract manufacturers, which includes most companies that make personal computers, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics goods. It also affects any company that typically sources, manufactures, and distributes parts made in China—and there will be second-order effects for companies that make parts in other places, as the entire supply chain slows. (If Apple can’t make iPhones, then all of their suppliers suffer the consequences.)On the demand side, the primary effect is the one Apple (ticker: AAPL) cited—China retail sales are at a standstill. But there could also be secondary effects as a shortage of products hits retail shelves in other markets.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi points out in a research note Tuesday that among the U.S. hardware companies he follows, the most exposed are PC makers            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ). He estimates that Dell has 20%-35% exposure to the China market on the supply side, with high-single-digit revenue exposure. The vulnerability is higher at HP, which sources more than half of its hardware, and generates about 10% of revenue, in China.Exposure is more limited for server manufacturers. Sacconaghi estimates            Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s      (HPE) China exposure at 3%-5% on the revenue side and 5%-10% on the manufacturing side. He puts            IBM’s      (IBM) exposure at under 5% for both revenue and manufacturing. More exposed is            Tesla      (TSLA), with an estimated 20% exposure to both the supply and demand sides of the market.In a research note this morning, Citi analyst Jim Suva provides a lengthy list of companies ranked by China revenue exposure, including glassmaker            Corning      (GLW), which gets about a quarter of its revenues from China and operates a glassmaking facility in Wuhan. There are implications here for the electronics distributors            Arrow Electronics      (ARW), at 20% revenue exposure, and            Avnet      (AVT), at 15%.  Barron’s reached out to a number of companies with potential China exposure for comments. The bottom line is that none are quite ready to quantify the impact on financial results, but neither are they ignoring the issue.Shares of Apple, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Avnet, Arrow, and Dell all closed modestly lower on Tuesday. The        S&P 500      was down 0.6%.  Write to Eric J.

0,"The technology stocks in the S&P 500 have returned about 50% over the past year, far ahead of any of the index’s other 10 sectors.If tech shares do cool off, the ones that sport attractive yields and trade at relatively low price/earnings ratios could be smart plays. That’s partly because a big yield can offset some capital losses, and partly because tech shares fitting those criteria are already cheap and don’t have as far to fall as more highly valued names.  Market Data Center:  Dividends To find some stocks that meet these defensive criteria, Barron’s started with a subset of the tech stocks in the S&P 500 index—notably those with yields of at least 2.5% and P/E ratios no higher than 15 times the current fiscal year’s profit estimate. Excluding some companies that have had big returns over the past year, as well as some smaller-cap stocks, Barron’s narrowed the initial group down to four companies that met these criteria. Of course, these companies come with investor concerns—hence their relatively high yields—and there are no guarantees. P/Es are based on current fiscal year estimates. Stock prices as of Jan. 17Source: FactSetThe company with the biggest yield on the list is            IBM      (ticker: IBM) at 4.7%. IBM has returned about 16% over the past year, hardly a disaster but badly trailing the tech sector. A major concern is sales growth. IBM last year earned $12.80 a share, down from $13.81 in 2018, according to FactSet. A company spokesman attributed the decline to “the impact of certain accounting rules for the purchase of Red Hat.” The consensus estimate for this year is $13.28. During the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October, CFO James Kavanaugh said that over the previous nine months, the company had returned $5.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.3 billion in dividends. IBM suspended its share-buyback program when it closed on its acquisition of Red Hat in July for about $34 billion. In April, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 a share, up 3%.Even though the company’s top-line growth has been challenged at times, IBM continues to generate plenty of cash flow to support its dividend. As of Sept. 30, it totaled $12.3 billion over the previous year. Read Next:  The Dow Could Hit 30,000 Five Years Ahead of Schedule. It Won’t Stop There. Cisco Systems      (CSCO), whose stock yields close to 3%, also generates a lot of cash flow. In the fiscal year that ended in July, the company’s free cash flow totaled nearly $15 billion, up from $12.8 billion a year earlier. Analysts expect the company to earn $3.24 a share this fiscal year, which ends in July, up 5% from $3.10 last year.The company, which makes data network switches, routers, and other products, said in its most recent annual report in October that it intends to return at least 50% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and stock repurchases. The two other stocks in the table are            Broadcom      (AVGO), whose products include semiconductors used in smartphones, and            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE), whose portfolio includes servers, data storage, and networking equipment. The stocks yield 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively.Broadcom has plenty of cash flow to support its dividend, which it raised in December by 23%, to $3.25 a share. Free cash flow totaled $9.3 billion in fiscal 2019, ended in October, compared with $8.3 billion a year earlier.For its fiscal quarter that ended on Oct. 31, Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported mixed results. Revenue fell 9% year over year, but profits rose 14%, to 49 cents a share. In its current fiscal year, HPE is expected to earn $1.86 a share, up 5% from $1.77 last year, on flattish revenue growth, according to FactSet. That should be enough for HPE to boost its dividend in the mid-single digits—reassurance that some tech shares have a yield shield if the broader sector does have a selloff. Write to Lawrence C.

0,"Xerox,      the U.S. printer and photocopier maker, this morning said it has secured financing for its $33 billion takeover bid of its larger rival            HP.In November, Xerox (ticker: XRX) made an unsolicited bid to buy its larger rival for $22 a share, including $17 in cash and the rest in Xerox stock. HP (HPQ) has repeatedly rejected the offer, saying that it “significantly undervalues” HP shares. HP previously expressed doubts about whether Xerox could finance the cash portion of the deal and also raised concerns about the considerable debt a combined company would need to support. In response to HP’s financing concerns, Xerox today said            Citigroup,Mizuho Financial Group,      and            Bank of America      have agreed to lend Xerox up to $24 billion to finance the transaction.A spokesman for HP said the company had no immediate comment on the Xerox announcement.Xerox management has been meeting with HP investors in an attempt to convince them to pressure HP’s board the proposed deal. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns more than 10% of Xerox and over 4% of HP, has backed the deal and described the possible combination as a “no-brainer.” Icahn also sits on the Xerox board. Some analysts and investors think it would make more sense financially for HP to flip the script and bid for Xerox.In its announcement this morning, Xerox includes a letter to HP CEO Enrique Lores and Chairman Chip Bergh from Xerox CEO John Visentin. Here’s the text: Dear Chip and Enrique,  Over the last several weeks, we have engaged in constructive dialogue with many of your largest shareholders regarding the strategic benefits of our proposal to acquire HP. It remains clear to all of us that bringing our companies together would deliver substantial synergies and meaningfully enhanced cash flow that could, in turn, enable increased investments in innovation and greater returns to shareholders.  But it also became clear from our dialogue with your shareholders that you and your advisors have been questioning our ability to raise the capital necessary to finance our proposal. We have always maintained that our proposal is not subject to a financing contingency, but in order to remove any doubt, we have obtained binding financing commitments (that are not subject to any due diligence condition) from Citi, Mizuho and Bank of America.  My offer stands to meet with you in person, with or without your advisors, to begin negotiating this transaction.  Sincerely,  John Visentin  Vice Chairman and CEO  Xerox Holdings Corporation This morning, HP shares are up 1.1%, to $20.75. Xerox is down 0.9% to $36.14.

For the quarter ended Oct. 31, the enterprise computing company (ticker: HPE) posted revenue of $7.2 billion, flat sequentially but down 9% year over year. The Wall Street consensus forecast was for revenue of $7.4 billion. By contrast, non-GAAP profits were 49 cents a share, up from 43 cents a share a year ago, and ahead of the company’s guidance range of 43 to 47 cents. GAAP earnings were 36 cents a share, above the guidance range of 24 to 28 cents.For the fiscal first quarter ending in January, the company expects profits of 42-46 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis, or 20-24 cents on a GAAP basis. The Street consensus for the quarter has been 42 cents.For fiscal 2020, the company continues to anticipate profits of $1.78 to $1.94 a share on a non-GAAP basis, or $1.01 to $1.17 on a GAAP basis.The company said revenue from its Hybrid IT business was $5.67 billion, down from $6.34 billion a year ago. Intelligent Edge segment revenues were $723 million, down from $773 million. Financial Services revenue was $878 million, down from $939 million.“We had a very successful fiscal year, marked by strong and consistent performance,” HP Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri said in a statement. “Through our disciplined execution, we improved profitability across the company and significantly exceeded our original non-GAAP earnings and cash flow outlook, while sharpening our focus, transforming our culture and delivering differentiated innovation to our customers as they accelerate their digital transformations.” Neri added that he is “confident in our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth as we continue to shift our portfolio to higher-value, software-defined solutions and execute our pivot to offering everything as a service by 2022.” In an interview with Barron’s Friday, Neri asserted that the company had a strong fiscal year, with growth in focus areas like high performance computing (up 15%) and hyper-converged systems (up 25%.) He said the company is seeing “accelerating momentum” both in profitability and cash flow, and repeated and recent projection that the company will grow the top-line between 1% and 3% through 2022.But Neri also noted that the year was a tale of two halves, with stronger results in the first two quarters, driven by tax reform and pent-up demand for modernization at some customers. The second half, he said, was marked by global trade uncertainties and “some geopolitical challenges,” among other factors. Neri’s says that revenue for the last few quarters has been “flat, consistent and stable,” but that the company “made that revenue way, way more profitable.”The stock is down 8%, to $16.06, on Tuesday.

Shares are up 20% in premarket trading. “Americas, which accounts for 65% of bookings, appears to be trending positively for the third straight quarter and suggests that new vice president of Americas Sales Kaddaras has stabilized the region,” wrote KeyBanc analyst Alex Kurtz in a Tuesday research report.

Those companies—            Microsoft       (ticker: MSFT),            Apple      (AAPL),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and Google parent            Alphabet      (GOOGL)—with their fortress-solid balance sheets, are poised to come out of the downturn just as strong as they went in. But for intrepid tech investors, there are less obvious opportunities to be found amid the current carnage and chaos.To help find the best ideas, Barron’s reached out to a few of our favorite tech-focused stockpickers. Some clear themes run through their recommendations: The work-from-home revolution underlines the power of cloud computing; we all still need to be entertained, even if we’re stuck at home; and we’re still going to need broadband, now more than ever.Here’s what the experts have to say: David Readerman Readerman is proprietor of Endurance Capital Partners, a San Francisco–based tech hedge fund. Readerman has zeroed in on cloud plays. “What’s certainly being reinforced right now,” he says, “is that cloud-based information-technology architecture is providing agility and resiliency for companies to operate dispersed workforces.”Readerman says the jury is out on whether there’s a lasting impact on how we work, but he adds that contingency planning now requires the ability to work remotely for extended periods. Among his cloud software picks are            DocuSign      (DOCU), a provider of digital-signature software, and            Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), the videoconferencing company that has been one of the year’s best stocks. “If there was ever doubt about the migration of the enterprise to cloud platforms, Covid-19 has proved its capabilities,” he says.Readerman concedes that Zoom’s valuation looks extreme—the stock trades at 34 times Wall Street’s sales estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2022—but he says there’s an opportunity for Zoom to monetize its surge in new users. He thinks that Zoom can expand beyond videoconferencing to offer a wider range of tools. “Zoom reminds me of AOL when it was everywhere, with ease of use and the freemium model,” he says.Readerman is bullish, too, on data center operators like            Equinix       (EQIX) and            Digital Realty Trust      (DLR). On the more speculative side, he likes their smaller rivals,            CyrusOne      (CONE) and            CoreSite Realty       (COR), which could be consolidation targets. He says that            Equinix      is seeing a surge in traffic to its servers, another sign of the growth of the cloud-computing trend. “Grocery stores are sold out of toilet paper, and we all need more broadband,” he says. Companies like            Equinix,      he adds, are “the critical on/off ramp for internet-based connectivity and commerce.” Rich Greenfield Greenfield, the co-founder of research boutique LightShed Partners, has covered entertainment and media companies for 25 years. His coverage universe was dealing with disruption—the technological kind—long before coronavirus, but the pandemic is creating a set of more serious challenges, with movie theaters and theme parks closed, sports shuttered, and ad budgets crunched. Greenfield notes that 12 of the top 50 TV advertisers are ailing auto makers; another 11 are quick-serve restaurant chains. The lack of sports content is particularly problematic on the advertising front. The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was canceled, and the National Basketball Association season, Major League Baseball, and the Olympics have all been delayed. There is no clarity on when the event calendar will pick up—and when people will be comfortable in public settings. “How long does it last?” Greenfield asks. “Does the stimulus ward off a recession or depression? It’s hard to tell. No one knows how to forecast this.”But people still crave entertainment, and that’s keeping Greenfield bullish on            Netflix      (NFLX). Unlike most content companies, Netflix sells no ads. And while movie and TV production is shut, Netflix has several months of new content ready to go. “They’re in a really strong position relative to their peers,” he says, pointing to            Walt Disney      (DIS), which has been battered on multiple fronts—its ESPN has no sports to show, its theme parks are closed, and it has no open theaters through which to distribute films. The weak ad market, meanwhile, is problematic for Disney’s broadcast and cable properties.Says Greenfield: “More people are using Netflix than ever before.” He notes that the number of subscribers is accelerating, which isn’t surprising given all of the home-bound people with more hours to fill and no sports to watch. He says Netflix will benefit from people switching to more expensive multiple-user plans and from reduced churn, or cancellations. In coming quarters, he says, Netflix will have “higher subscriptions, higher average revenue per user, and better free cash flow than people think.” Greenfield is also bullish on            Twitter      (TWTR), which this past week warned that revenue for its March quarter would be down year over year, as ad budgets fall. But, he notes, Twitter is seeing record usage. While profits and revenue will take a near-term hit, he points out that Twitter can withstand the crisis, with $6.6 billion in cash. And the company is poised to benefit from a crowded events calendar once the virus threat ebbs. “There aren’t enough weekends on the calendar for all the stuff coming down from September through summer 2021,” Greenfield says, with spring sporting events shifted to the fall, a packed film-release schedule, and the November election. “It’s absurd.” And he thinks it will all drive traffic—and ad dollars—to Twitter.  Paul Meeks Meeks wears multiple hats, as a portfolio manager for Independent Solutions Wealth Management, an asset management firm in Williamsville, N.Y., and a manager of The Wireless Fund, a small tech mutual fund. Meeks say that he has been using the recent rally to raise cash, while dabbling in marquee names and “banking proceeds for a better day.” Meeks says that he’s waiting until “earnings estimates are slashed to the bone” before making substantial new commitments. “I need to see them all confess all their sins, and to take down numbers dramatically.” In the meantime, Meeks has been nibbling on megacaps, specifically Amazon and            Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA), both of which he thinks will benefit from the expanded role that e-commerce will play in the post-coronavirus world. Eventually, he says, when earnings estimates reset, he wants to own his “dream team of semiconductor stocks,” including            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD),            Lam Research      (LRCX),            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing      (TSM),            Micron Technology      (MU), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT), where he expects to go from basically zero to a big overweight. Meanwhile, Meeks is bullish on            Virtu Financial      (VIRT), a New York–based tech-driven financial trading platform. Meeks sees the company as a play on volatility. He notes that Virtu trades for about 10 times earnings and pays a “fairly certain” dividend, currently yielding 4.3%. “When stocks go up endlessly again, and investors are complacent, they become an average company again,” he says. But, for now, Virtu will benefit as long as we continue to see “whipsaw moves in both directions.” Dan Niles Niles is founder and portfolio manager for the Satori Fund, a tech-focused hedge fund. On Feb. 17, just after Apple pulled its March quarter guidance, Niles tweeted that he had 50% of his portfolio short Apple, seven of the company’s suppliers, and        QQQ,      an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. It was a prescient call. Niles remains generally bearish on the market, but there are stocks he likes and owns, particularly around videogames. While Niles thinks the market has exaggerated the impact of a fifth-generation, or 5G, iPhone launch later this year, he sees opportunity in a less-watched product cycle: new videogame consoles from Microsoft and            Sony      (SNE), expected this fall. “They’re going to launch the first new hardware platforms since 2013, and everyone is stuck at home,” he says. “I like them all,” he says of the videogame stocks, including            Zynga      (ZNGA),            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO), and            Electronic Arts      (EA), along with China’s            NetEase      (NTES) and            Tencent Holdings      (700.Hong Kong).Other Niles bets are Amazon, a beneficiary from the shift to e-commerce, and work-at-home play            RingCentral      (RNG), a cloud-based communications provider. Meanwhile, he’s still ready to short Apple again as the stock rallies. For one thing, he says, “I don’t know who is going to feel rich enough to buy an iPhone.” And he wonders why anyone would pay 19 times current earnings for Apple, when other hardware plays like            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ) trade for just seven times.  Craig Moffett Moffett, founder of the research boutique MoffettNathanson, is the market’s most influential telecom and cable seer. He predicts deep issues for some of the largest companies he covers, notably            AT&T      (T) and            Comcast      (CMCSA), given their exposure to ad-supported content through their respective WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal segments. AT&T and Comcast are getting a boost from their broadband units, but Moffett sees better ways to play that trend.He’s bullish on            Charter Communications      (CHTR) and            Altice USA       (ATUS), both pure plays on the cable business and, therefore, free of ad-supported content worries. Charter is down 13% over the past month. “The fact that Charter has sold off as much as the broader market makes no sense at all,” Moffett says. “The cable companies are simply digital infrastructure providers. They are agnostic about how you can get your video content. And the broadband business is going to be just fine.” He says that Altice, while a little riskier than Charter, is even cheaper. Both companies are seeing demand for faster—and more expensive—broadband plans, with parents and children spending so many hours at home. Moffett thinks that Altice could rally 40% to 50%, while Charter could rise 30% to 40%. Moffett is also bullish on            T-Mobile US      (TMUS), which is about to be a strong No. 3 player in the U.S. wireless market after it closes a pending deal to buy            Sprint      (S). “They’ll be very well positioned, with line of sight to cost savings and margin expansion, and network advantages that should translate into market-share gains for years and years to come,” he says. And while Moffett still sees some risk to the deal’s completion, he thinks that T-Mobile is attractive with or without Sprint.  Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedDell Technologies      and its majority-owned subsidiary            VMware      have both withdrawn their financial guidance, citing uncertainties about their businesses created by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Both companies made their announcements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Dell (ticker: DELL) said in its filing that it is seeing “heightened interest in work from home solutions and continuing execution in its global supply chain, and remains confident in its liquidity position,” but that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operations for the current fiscal year.” Dell had previously projected revenue for its February 2021 fiscal year of $92 billion to $95 billion, with profits of $5.90 to $6 a share. At the time, Dell said the outlook didn’t reflect any potential impact from the virus.Likewise, VMware (VMW) said in its own SEC filing that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operation,” and therefore it is withdrawing its previous guidance for both the May quarter and the February 2021 fiscal year. The company’s previous guidance had been for full-year revenue of $12.05 billion, with May-quarter revenues of $2.73 billion.On Thursday, PC-related stocks got a boost from some bullish comments after the close on Wednesday from memory chip company            Micron Technology      (MU), which said that it was seeing a boost in demand from strong PC sales as more people upgrade their systems to handle extended periods of working and studying from home. Dell’s announcement removes some of the shine from yesterday’s optimism.Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong points out in a research note Friday that while many semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have withdrawn guidance in recent weeks, many hardware companies have not, such as            HP Inc.      (HPQ),            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Lenovo Group      (0992.Hong Kong), and            Pure Storage      (PSTG). His conclusion is that the announcement “was not entirely unexpected given market conditions.” But Ong still likes Dell shares, asserting that the company has “several underappreciated offsets,” including market share gains, downside protection given a low valuation, and deleveraging potential. He keeps his Buy rating on the stock.Dell stock is down 7.2%, to $39.48, in recent trading, while VMware is down 8.2%, to $114.48. Dell rival HP Inc. is off 6.9%, to $16.72.

0,"Add servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

0,"Tech investors need to brace for rough seas. That’s the underlying message in a new note from Citi analyst Jim Suva, who has cut his estimates for all 30 companies he covers, cutting price targets on many and reducing ratings on a few. The impact of the coronavirus, he now fears, will be worse than he had anticipated.In the early days of the outbreak, the focus for the technology hardware sector was the disruption of the supply chain, as China-based component providers and contract electronics manufacturers closed down for multiple weeks. Companies like            Apple      (AAPL),            Dell Technologies      (DELL),            HP Inc.      (HPQ) and many others acknowledged that they faced near-term supply disruption, as well as short-run demand issues in China. But the overall view was that demand issues would be transient—orders delayed rather than orders lost for good. Suva now believes that was wishful thinking. In a new 220-page report, Suva says that the Street has been underestimating the demand-side issues created by the coronavirus and the rapid shutdown of normal global business. In a research note published late Friday, Suva cut his estimates for all the companies in his coverage universe: PC and networking hardware vendors, consumer-devices companies, electronics distributors, and disk-drive companies. None was spared. He cut ratings on four companies:            Hewlett Packard Enterprise       (HPE) to Sell from Neutral,            GoPro      (GPRO) to Sell from Neutral,            Infinera      (INFN) to Sell from Neutral, and            CommScope Holding      (COMM) to Neutral from Buy.Even for the stocks he still recommends, Suva is reducing his expectations. For instance, while he kept a Buy rating on Apple shares, he chopped his price target to $310, from $375, while trimming his EPS estimates for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years to below current consensus levels.Suva noted that in all cases, he is reducing his estimates below the most recent guidance from the companies, “given the elongated resolution of the coronavirus and the ripple economic effect associated with the global nature.” He predicts that in the weeks ahead, many IT hardware and telecom equipment companies will issue negative preannouncements.“To be fair, this is not due to company performance or operations but rather due to the coronavirus, which will materially impact the tech supply chain and end demand which we view as actual demand declines and the shortfalls will not be recouped later in the year,” Suva wrote. “Our view is the recent valuation multiple compression is not short term but rather the new norm for a U-shaped demand bottom which will be slow and gradual.”Suva previously trimmed estimates on the companies in his universe to reflect the impact of the virus, but he is now convinced that he didn’t cut far enough.“Our original cuts were under the view that the virus would be more contained, shorter lived and the demand impact would be more of a push out and this demand softness would be recouped as 2020 progressed,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, the reality is the virus is having a prolonged duration and global reach with an impact across most industries and end markets. While we are encouraged by some positive signs of parts of China returning to normal business operations ... we note this has taken longer than anticipated.”To make his estimate adjustments, he included the assumption that growth in global gross domestic product in 2020 will be reduced by a full percentage point, to 1.5%, a point below the last World Bank estimate of 2.5%.He sees the auto sector down 5%, worse than his previous estimate of down 3%, with consumer electronics flat, rather up 2%. “Yes, we expect investors to push back saying much of this will be recaptured later in 2020, but we do not believe this demand will come back,” he writes. “Accordingly, our sales and EPS adjustments impact cascades beyond the current quarter and impact all of 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 ... We do not believe demand will bounce back as both consumers and enterprises adjust to a new norm of using technology longer and working more remotely as well as we see a broad based employment hiring pause.” Write to Eric J.

0,"HP Inc.      shares have been dragged down in the market sell-off, despite the company’s pledge to buy back half of its outstanding shares and the hostile tender offer from Xerox. JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster thinks the sell-off has gone too far. On Thursday, he upped his rating on HP (ticker: HPQ) to Overweight from Neutral, with a price target of $24. Coster writes in a research note that the call is “taking advantage of the market correction to buy an attractively valued stock in advance of positive catalysts.” He notes that HP has pledged to buy back $8 billion of stock within 12 months of its upcoming annual meeting—and the company intends to buy back $15 billion of stock over the next three years. Meanwhile,            Xerox      (XRX) still has a $24-a-share cash and stock takeover bid on the table (although the actual value of that offer has dropped to $22.32, as Xerox shares have tumbled in the selloff.) An HP bid for Xerox is also a potential outcome, he adds. At some point, he notes, the coronavirus disruption to the company’s supply chain will ease. On the virus issue, he notes that HP was one of the first companies to pre-announce a negative impact from COVID-19, and “could be first out with good news on the supply-side (barring a relapse).” He says the company seems confident about supply, but with some concerns about demand as business and consumer spending slow, partially offset with additional PC and printer sales as more people work from home.Coster thinks the market selloff makes it more difficult for Xerox to successfully close its bid for HP, given the debt financing required for the deal and reduced investor appetite for credit risk.“Our guess at probable outcomes here? HP probably goes it alone, but there is still a small chance that HP makes a counter bid for Xerox, and we think an even thinner chance that Xerox wins the shareholder vote and proceeds to acquire HP,” he writes.Coster notes that as of Wednesday’s close, the stock was trading at 7.4 times calendar 2020 estimated non-GAAP EPS, and 5.4 times estimated calendar 2020 EBITDA, discounts to the three-year historic averages of 10.2 times for EPS and 7.3 times EBITDA. “We think the discounts are starting to look attractive, assuming there is a recovery in demand once Covid-19 is contained and the firm starts to buy back shares under the go-it-alone strategy,” he writes.HP shares on Thursday are down 8.1%, to $17.79, while Xerox is off 6.9%, to $25.91.

0,"HP Inc.      CEO Enrique Lores has had a remarkably eventful first few months as the company’s CEO. Since replacing Dion Weisler in the top job last August, the company has struggled through demand issues with its crucial print supply business, launched a new business model for printers, maneuvered through a microprocessor shortage, and dealt with the fallout from the rapid spread of coronavirus which has disrupted the companies supply chain. And, of course, Lores has been at the forefront as HP (ticker: HPQ) battles a hostile tender offer and proxy fight by            Xerox Holdings      (XRX), a company a fraction of HP’s size.A native of Madrid with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic University of Valencia and an M.B.A. from Esade Business School in Barcelona, Lores has been with HP since joining as an intern in 1989. Before his recent ascent to the top spot, he ran the company’s printing business, steering the company’s 2017 acquisition of            Samsung Electronics      ’ (005930.Korea) printing business. He also played a key role in the separation of the old Hewlett-Packard into two separate companies: HP Inc. and            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE).  Barron’s recently sat down for a chat with Lores in the company’s historic HP Laboratories building in Palo Alto, Calif., where the old offices of founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard are still preserved for posterity—and where the company’s engineers continue to develop new tech printing and PC technologies. Among other things, Lores discussed why HP is so opposed to the Xerox bid—and why HP might want to turn around and buy Xerox.   Barron’s: Enrique, let’s start with Xerox. You’ve repeatedly rejected their takeover bid as too low. But you’ve also said you see value in consolidating the printing business and that you’re willing to talk to Xerox about potential deals. Given they’re unlikely to raise their offer, that suggests you might want to buy Xerox. Can you explain your thinking?  Lores: When we look at the print market, especially in the office space, we don’t see significant growth going forward. But there are many competitors—and there is going to be consolidation. And when you drive consolidation by reducing costs, you create value. Three years ago, we bought the Samsung printing business. We drove consolidation and created value. It was a money-losing unit before we bought it and profitable the first year after the deal closed. That deal helped accelerate our growth in managed print services. With Xerox, the problem we have is with the deal on the table. It doesn’t create value for our shareholders.  Remind us why you said no. First, the price they’re offering doesn’t recognize the stand-alone value this company has. The second problem is the high leverage the combined company would have, which we consider extremely risky. Third is that the synergies they’re using to calculate the value of the deal are unrealistic. They count cost savings we’re already finding as a stand-alone company.  So what if HP turned around and bought Xerox? Hold on. There are three questions that need to be addressed first. How do we get to the right value exchange between the two companies? How do we create an entity with the right capital structure? And how do we align on a realistic set of assumptions for synergies? That’s the first conversation. How the companies get together, who buys whom—there are many ways of doing that, but we don’t think it should be the first conversation. You don’t actually compete with Xerox much, do you? The overlap is small. We’re a $60 billion company. About $40 billion of that is PCs, with zero overlap. Of the remaining $20 billion, about half is consumer printers, with zero overlap. Of the rest, we do about $2.8 billion in managed print services, which is where we compete. They’re about a $9 billion business. That’s why when they say there are $2 billion in synergies, out of a combined $12 billion in business—well, that would be a miracle. If you bought them, where would the value be? We see an opportunity to drive costs down. We are investing in R&D, we both invest in marketing. We estimate the cost synergies are around $1 billion. It would also give us a larger presence in managed print services.  But you repeatedly have said you have other options. Our priority is to execute our plan, which is going to create a lot of value for shareholders. We are open to exploring consolidation, but there are other opportunities we’re considering from an M&A perspective.  When you say other opportunities, are you talking about other printing deals? Or might you do something on the PC side? Both. There are opportunities in the print market. There are opportunities in the personal systems market. Some might involve consolidation, others might be about expanding into other segments. There are opportunities in graphics printing and industrial printing. There are opportunities in 3-D printing. Is Xerox open to the possibility of you buying them? We have talked, but I don’t see value in sharing the discussions we’ve had in public.  What are you hearing from your institutional holders about the Xerox offer and about your own plan, which includes a large stock buyback and cost-cutting measures? We presented our plan a few weeks ago, and since then we’ve spent a lot of time sharing, discussing, and explaining the plan. The response has been very positive. Investors understand how we plan to manage the company, and they like the amount of capital to be returned. Have you also been in contact with Carl Icahn, who is the largest Xerox holder and also holds a 4% stake in HP? We regularly talk to all of our key shareholders. He’s one. But we won’t talk about the specific conversations, not with him or with any others.  One of your biggest operating issues in recent quarters has been decreasing revenue from ink and toner. What are you doing to fix that issue? It’s an opportunity to become more profitable. If you look at our installed base, we lose money with 25% of our customers who buy a printer and either don’t print enough or don’t use HP supplies. We have a plan in place to address the issue. What’s the plan? The first thing is to shift from a transactional model to a subscription model. With the new model, we monitor the amount of ink in your printer and before you run out, we send you a new cartridge. You pay us a fixed fee per month. The model is very attractive for consumers—it addresses the two big problems consumers have. The first problem is running out of ink. The second is printing is too expensive. Your cost per page goes down by up to 70%.  Is that program fully rolled out? We already have 6 million subscribers, and the program is growing fast. In the U.S., 20% of customers who buy a printer end up as subscribers.  How are the third-party suppliers fighting back?  We’re seeing some retailers offering “replenishment models.” The difference with our program is that we get data directly from the printer, so we know exactly what you need. We know exactly when the printer is going to run out of ink. Also, the cartridges we use are bigger. The overall cost of our model is significantly lower. How does the hardware price vary if you pay for ink with a subscription? No change. The difference is that we’ll send you ink cartridges before you run out. You can drop from the program at any point, but the retention rate is in the high 90s. Customers love the program because it addresses a key problem—they don’t need to buy cartridges anymore, and the cost of printing is cheaper. Will most consumers adopt that model? We think 40% to 50% of customers will subscribe. The percentages will grow because that’s the way more and more consumers want to buy. But you are taking an alternative approach in emerging markets. Right. In those markets, the printer comes with a very big reservoir of ink or toner, which, depending your consumption rate, could last a year, two years, three years. That’s a change in our model, and those printers are profitable. The average life of a printer is three to five years. In many cases, you might choose to buy a new printer. But we also have the ability to refill the ink. You’ve also announced a shift in your business model for retail customers.  Yes, we’re adopting a model that looks like the one mobile phones used to have. We’re going to offer two options. One we call an end-to-end system, which will only work with HP supplies. The price of the hardware will be similar to where it is today. We’ll also offer a flexible system, which will work with supplies from other companies, and the hardware price will be higher.  And you are going to start doing that at the end of 2020. Yes. It will take almost two years to change the whole portfolio to this model. The important thing is the print business will be in much better shape as we drive these transitions. For the personal-systems business—the PC business—there have been some positive dynamics over the past year. The Windows 10 refresh cycle has driven demand, and memory chip pricing has been soft. And then there has been a tight supply of microprocessors. In the January quarter, you had your highest operating margins in the PC business in many years. But that’s not sustainable, is it? The PC business is more than 60% of revenue and close to 50% of profits. It’s a critical business for us. In recent years, we’ve been able to outgrow the market in revenue, units, and profits. We have been growing and improving profitability, driven by the innovation we bring to market, the experiences we create, and the scale we have. But what happens with margins? And growth? We’re confident in our ability to continue to grow the business at or above the market pace. When we look at the overall PC market, the expectation from analysts is that it will grow around 4% for the next three to five years in revenue. In the segments where we operate, which are not growing as fast, growth is 1% to 1.2%, and we should grow at or above that rate. In terms of margins, you’re right that the margins we have now are the best in a long time. Our long-term projection is for margins between 3.5% and 5.5%. So in the latest quarter, we were one full point above the top of the long-term range. We think at the end of the year we will be within the target range. Let’s discuss these component supply and demand issues. The component issues are extending the life of the Windows refresh, by not having enough processors, and now because of the implications of the coronavirus. We expect to see very solid growth in this business just driven by these changes. On top of that, there is a large installed base of PCs that are older than four or five years, hundreds of millions of units that will eventually be replaced.  You raised this notion about M&A in personal systems. What’s your thinking there? We’ve always said any transaction needs to be supported by three things. It needs to be aligned to the strategies we have explained. It needs to have a solid financial case. And we need to have an execution plan that will support the financial gains. If I apply those filters to personal systems, we have said that we see opportunities to grow in certain verticals where margins are better—for example, retail point-of-sale systems, where we are the leaders in the market. We have said we want to grow in the services category. We have said we want to grow in the accessories category. We have said we want to grow in specific premium categories. There could open opportunities to use M&A to complement our position.  Give us a brief update on how 3-D printing is going. It’s a fantastic opportunity. We are leveraging technologies that we have built for years. There are opportunities in automotive, in aeronautics, in the medical space. At the same time, though, we are talking about transforming large industries, and that takes time. But once it happens, it scales. And it is very sticky. That’s why we decided that this strategy for the company is to focus on real manufacturing opportunities. And we are actually making good progress in working with some of the largest manufacturing partners to use our technology to grow into this category.  I used to see the opportunity in printing replacement parts. But you see this as a primary production technology. The value of 3-D printing is not only in aftermarket parts. It is in designing parts that will be created with 3-D printing, because you can create structures that are more complicated, structures that with traditional modern methods cannot be built, but that have better physical performance. For example, something really important for cars going forward is weight, especially as we go to electric cars. With 3-D printing you can create much lighter parts. You can design a part of that because the same physical performance but significantly less weight.  How far is this from being material to your financial results?  It’s a great long-term opportunity, but it won’t be material for a few years.  Finally, how has HP been affected by the coronavirus so far? After the Chinese New Year, production didn’t restart at the pace it usually does. But it has been recovering. Clearly there has been an impact in terms of the products that we will have in the short term to sell. It’s a supply problem, not demand. Are you through the worst of it? In China, yes. But the situation is fluid. We have seen steady progress, with factories coming up to speed in alignment with a plan that we had two weeks ago. It has not gotten worse.  Is the impact spread across your business?  Yes. It’s an issue for print hardware, PCs, and printer suppliers. We were already having product shortages because of processors, and we have customers not getting the products they want. But that’s the situation we’ve already been in.  And what about demand? If anything, PC demand is stronger than we were expecting. As many companies launch their business-continuity programs, they need their employees to have PCs to work from home. In many cases, they had desktops, and now companies are offering them notebooks.  Enrique, thanks so much.  Write to Eric J.

1,"In            Xerox Holdings      has filed proxy materials urging            HP Inc.      shareholders to support its proposed slate for the HP board. Xerox (ticker: XRX) has launched a $24-a-share cash and stock bid for shares of HP (HPQ) , which HP’s current board has rejected as too low and not in the best interests of HP shareholders.Monday’s filing specifically focuses on the Xerox board slate, asserting that supporting its nominees “will send a clear and strong message to the HP board to negotiate with Xerox” on the proposed transition. Xerox adds that voting for its slate will show that shareholders want HP to focus on creating stockholder value, objectively evaluate the Xerox offer, and to negotiate in good faith with Xerox about the proposal.The filing includes a detailed “ticktock” of events in the relationship between the two companies, similar to, but with interesting differences from a similar timeline laid out in a recent HP filing. Among other things, Xerox asserts that former HP CEO Dion Weisler in conversations with Xerox CEO John Visentin “expressed particular interest in how a board of directors functioned when a company had a large activist involved or was owned or controlled by a private-equity fund.” That is an obvious allusion to investor Carl Icahn, who holds 10% of Xerox shares, as well as 4% of HP’s stock. According to the filing, “Visentin explained several advantages in each scenario, all of which were primarily derived from a greater focus on results over politics.” In other words, Visentin seem to be saying that having an activist like Icahn hanging around your stock is a good thing.The filing asserts that Weisler “often expressed frustration with certain members of the HP board, whom he said preferred listening to the sound of their own voice more than helping to facilitate effective and efficient strategic decision-making.” And the filing adds that “Weisler expressed particular concern about his senior leadership team...In one instance, after poor quarterly results caused a precipitous stock price drop, Mr. Weisler attempted to rally the senior leadership team and was outraged when he received questions from them about whether the poor results would impact bonuses.”Weisler has since stepped down as CEO over a family health issue.In the proxy, Xerox also proposes a measure that would repeal any amendments to the company’s bylaws approved by the board but not by shareholders since Feb. 7, 2019. That measure would appear to be targeted at reversing the company’s recent “poison pill” rights offering, which was adopted as a defense against a hostile takeover.HP shares on Monday were down 9.6%, to $19.36, while Xerox was off 8.5%, to $28.62.

0,"HP Inc.said on Thursday that its board had voted unanimously to recommend shareholders reject a $24-a-share cash-and-stock tender offer for the company from            Xerox Holdings.That decision is not exactly surprising—HP (ticker: HPQ) has repeatedly been saying “no” to Xerox (XRX) since the takeover drama began in November.HP shares were down 0.6%, to $21.47, on Thursday morning, while Xerox was off 4%, at $32.34.Repeating a position it has taken before, HP said the offer, which consists of $18.40 a share in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share, “meaningfully undervalues HP and disproportionately benefits Xerox shareholders.”HP adds that “Xerox is essentially offering HP shareholders something they already own,” and that the offer “fails to reflect the full value of HP’s assets and stand-alone strategic and financial value creation plan.” HP recently announced plans to repurchase about half of its shares outstanding, and committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to holders going forward via dividends and stock buybacks.Also, HP said that the Xerox offer “would create an irresponsible capital structure, resulting in significant risks for HP shareholders.” Xerox has lined up a lending group to provide financing for the cash portion of the offer.“Our message to HP shareholders is clear: the Xerox offer undervalues HP and disproportionately benefits Xerox shareholders at the expense of HP shareholders,” Chip Bergh, the chairman of the HP board, said in a statement. “The Xerox offer would leave our shareholders with an investment in a combined company that is burdened with an irresponsible level of debt and which would subsequently require unrealistic, unachievable synergies that would jeopardize the entire company.”In their response, HP rattles off a long list of reasons it opposes the deal, including the fact that Xerox management has no experience in personal systems, home printing and 3D printing. HP also contends that the estimates Xerox has offered on potential synergies “exceed reasonably achievable levels.”Xerox spokesperson said the company did not have any immediate comment.

0,"Dell Technologies      on Thursday afternoon announced in-line results for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 31 and unveiled plans for a two-year, $1 billion stock-repurchase plan.For the quarter, Dell (ticker: DELL) posted revenue of $24 billion, with non-GAAP profits of $2 a share. The Wall Street analyst consensus had been $24 billion and $2.02 a share. For the full year, Dell posted revenue of $92.2 billion; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) of $11.8 billion; and non-GAAP profits of $7.35 a share. Full-year guidance had been $91.5 billion to $92.5 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP profits of $7.25 to $7.40 a share.On its conference call with investors this afternoon, Dell said it expects fiscal year 2021 revenues of $92 billion to $95 billion, with profits of $5.90 to $6 a share. Previous Street consensus had been for $93 billion and earnings of $6.71 a share. Dell said the full-year outlook doesn’t reflect any potential impact from the current coronavirus issue. Dell also said it expects the Windows 10 refresh cycle to continue through the first half of the year, but that component costs this year will be “inflationary,” and a headwind to margins. Dell said it expects first-quarter results to be affected by softness in China, which is the company’s second-largest market. Dell also has substantial exposure to China-based component providers and contract manufacturers.“In fiscal 2020, we focused on integration and simplicity across our businesses and product portfolio to accelerate winning go-to-market solutions for our customers,” Dell Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a statement. “With more than $180 billion in revenue over the past two years and significant investments in research, innovation and breadth of capability, we have a uniquely advantaged position heading into the next digital decade.”In an interview with Barron’s this afternoon, Dell CFO Tom Sweet noted that while the company isn’t providing specific financial guidance for the April quarter, the sequential decline in revenues from the January quarter will be a little worse than the historical average drop of about 8%, reflecting the impact of the cororonavirus. Meanwhile, he notes that most of the questions on the company’s call with investors focused on the company’s storage and server business, which were down sharply both in the quarter and the full year. He says Dell expects a better year in FY 2021, with some growth in ISG, the company’s infrastructure solutions group. Read more:  Dell Is a Top Stock for 2020. Here’s Why. Dell notes that it repaid $1.5 billion in debt in the quarter and $5 billion for the year, and has now paid down $19.5 billion in gross debt since closing the acquisition of EMC in September 2016. Some investors might be surprised by the announced repurchase plan, given the company’s recent focus on debt reduction. “While de-levering remains the primary capital allocation goal, the company sees an opportunity to take advantage of what it believes is a significant discount in the current stock price,” Dell said in a statement. “This share repurchase plan is another lever the company will use as it continues to focus on creating value for shareholders.”Dell’s Client Solutions Group revenue was up 8% in the quarter, driven by 10% growth in commercial revenue. The company said the group, which includes the Dell PC business, shipped a record 46.5 million units for the full year. Infrastructure Solutions Group fared less well, with revenue down 11% in the quarter. Storage revenue was down 3%, while servers and networking were down 19%.The strength in PC demand mirrors the better-than-expected results at            HP Inc.      (HPQ), which saw a surprise jump in operating margins in the quarter. PC makers have benefited in recent quarters from a combination of the continued            Microsoft      (MSFT) Windows 10 refresh cycle, which has boosted PC demand, plus soft memory chip pricing. Memory prices have begun to trend higher, which will drag on PC margins going forward.Dell shares in Thursday’s regular session closed down 5.1% at $43.56. The        S&P 500      lost 4.4%.

Dell’s full-year guidance was for $91.5 billion to $92.2 billion in revenue and non-GAAP profits of $7.25 to $7.40 a share.Current April-quarter consensus calls for revenue of $22.2 billion and non-GAAP profits of $1.45 a share. The Street is projecting fiscal-year 2021 revenues of $93 billion with profits of $6.71 a share. This week’s stronger-than-expected January-quarter performance by            HP Inc.      (HPQ)—which was driven in particular by better-than-expected margins in personal computers—suggests the story could be a strong one for Dell’s January results. PC makers have been benefiting from a combination of the tail-end of the Microsoft Windows 10 upgrade cycle, which has been driving incremental PC demand, and recently depressed prices for memory chips. Tight supplies of            Intel      (INTC) processors has also helped keep prices firm. Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong on Wednesday tweaked his Dell earnings model, inching up expectations for the January quarter based in part on “memory tailwinds,” while trimming estimates for April and the 2021 fiscal year to reflect expectations that Dell will take a conservative view on the impact of coronavirus. Read more: Dell Is a Top Stock for 2020. Here’s Why. “Overall, we remain concerned with the CPU constraints and coronavirus impacts on Dell’s business, especially if they continue longer than expected,” Ong writes in a research note. “However, we believe that Dell has a number of under-appreciated offsets (market share gains vs. peers, valuation downside protection, de-leveraging potential) and therefore maintain our bullish stance.” He keeps a Buy rating, while trimming his price target to $58 from $60. J.P. Morgan’s      Paul Coster expects a “solid” January earnings report driven by healthy PC shipments, “on possible pull in demand coupled with market share gains.” And he says recent earnings reports from both HP and            Lenovo Group      (992.Hong Kong) suggest “solid margin performance” is likely. But he trimmed his April-quarter outlook to reflect the likely impact from the virus—his forecast is now for revenue of $21.8 billion with non-GAAP profits of $1.30 a share, below the current consensus. Coster keeps an Overweight rating, while reducing his price target to $65 from $70.But Coster adds that with the stock trading at 7.7 times estimated calendar0year 2020 Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), “Dell looks somewhat undervalued.” And he says that the stock also looks undervalued on a sum-of-the-parts basis, given Dell’s share of publicly held subsidiaries—in particular            VMware      (VMW)—account for about $50 billion of market cap—well in excess of Dell’s own $35 billion market cap, though Dell also has about $49 billion in long-term debt. Writes Coster: “We think Dell stock can re-rate higher on continued solid execution and paydown of debt.”Dell stock is up 1.8%, at $47.04, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      is up 1.6%.

It comes after            Mastercard      (MA) cut its revenue outlook earlier this week and U.S. software giant            HP Inc.      (HPQ) factored in an 8% hit to its earnings per share for the second quarter, following            Apple’s      (AAPL) second-quarter guidance warning last week.Diageo (DEO)—the British drinks company, whose brands include Johnnie Walker and Guinness—said on Wednesday sales had been hurt by the closure of bars and restaurants in China along with the postponement of events and fall in tourism across Asia.It estimated that organic net sales in 2020 would be £225 million to £325 million lower as a result but that still depended on the “timing and pace of recovery,” while operating profit would be £140 million to £200 million lower.The company, like many others, said it was unable to “quantify the impact” at its interim results at the end of January.Since then the virus has spread outside of China, across Asia and into Europe. More than 81,000 people have been infected world-wide and the death toll has risen above 2,750.Danone, the world’s largest yogurt maker and Evian water owner, lowered sales and profit margin forecasts for the year on Wednesday.

0," Last November, when details were first trickling in on the unusual            Xerox Holdings      plan to bid for the much-larger            HP Inc.,      Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi speculated that the real goal of the offer might have been to goad HP to turn around and buy Xerox. That approach, he wrote in a research note at the time, made “a lot more financial sense” given that HP’s market cap is so much bigger—now $34 billion for HP versus $7.7 billion for Xerox.A lot has happened since Xerox (ticker: XRX) first offered $22 a share in cash and stock for its bigger rival in the printing business. HP (HPQ) said no. Xerox said it secured financing for the deal. HP said no. Xerox said a deal would generate huge financial synergies. HP said no. Xerox announced a board slate, raised its bid to $24 a share, and threatened a proxy fight. HP said no, no, and no. Over the past few days, HP issued a poison-pill rights offering, announced a plan to buy back 50% of its stock to boost shareholder value, and again told Xerox “no.”But amid a flurry of announcements yesterday, HP also said that it “is reaching out to Xerox to explore if there is a combination that creates value for HP shareholders that is additive to HP’s strategic and financial plan.” To read between the lines, that suggests HP might be interested in a deal in which it buys Xerox, as Sacconaghi wrote last year.On HP’s post-earnings conference call with investors Monday, Sacconaghi asked CEO Enrique Lores about that possibility. Lores dodged the question—but he didn’t say no. “At this point, Toni, I don’t think that who buys what is a real conversation,” he said on the call. “We need to make sure that the valuation of the two companies is fair based on the value that both companies are going to be bringing to the joint entity. We need to make sure that the resulting capital structure makes sense for the businesses where we will be operating and we need to make sure also that there is a fair, a clear assessment of what the synergies are. This is, I think, the important conversation for our shareholders. Once we clarify that, then who, how, are things that will be discussed after that.”That hint prompted Sacconaghi to ask in a research note today whether HP will now buy Xerox.“While HP implicitly stated it wouldn’t accept an offer from Xerox regardless of price,” he writes, “management did appear to express potential interest in buying Xerox instead, citing ~$1 billion in synergies, and indicated they were reaching out to Xerox to explore opportunities.” Sacconaghi calculates that buying Xerox for $11 billion—about a 30% premium—could add 40 to 80 cents (17%-35%) to HP’s earnings per share, depending on the mix of cash and stock, and that HP could still proceed with its huge buyback plan on top of buying Xerox without compromising its investment-grade debt rating.HP generates about $5 billion a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, he notes, and synergies from buying Xerox could add another $2 billion to 2.5 billion, with only a few hundred million dollars in incremental annual interest expense. A spokesman for Xerox yesterday said the company had no comment on HP’s announcements.It is telling that on a horrific day for the stock market—the        S&P 500      lost more than 3%—Xerox shares jumped 4.6%, to $36.46. HP shares rallied 5.7%, to $23.35, as investors reacted positively to HP’s stronger-than-expected earnings report and aggressive stock-buyback plan. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedHP Inc.      didn’t solve all of its issues with Monday’s fire hose of news announcements, but the printer and PC company has dramatically strengthened its hand in its battle to fend off a hostile bid from            Xerox Holdings.      It improved its standing with investors in the process.First, a quick rundown of the news:Even the bears on HP shares found things to like. Many analysts raised their target prices on the stock to reflect the updated financial outlook and aggressive repurchase plans. There seems to be growing agreement that the prospects for the current Xerox bid are fading fast, as HP cuts costs, buys back stock, and takes other steps to carve out an independent path that boosts shareholder value.The other interesting takeaway is that the Street seems to be more convinced that HP’s proposed talks with Xerox would turn the tables, and that HP could become the buyer. Some observers have noted that possibility since the start of this drama, given that an HP acquisition of Xerox would require much less leverage than a transaction with Xerox as the buyer. Meanwhile, almost ignored in the latest results is the fact that HP’s biggest ongoing issue—weakness in its ink and toner business—hasn’t been resolved. Revenues from printer supplies fell again, dropping 7% year over year. That issue, by the way, is in no way addressed by a combination with Xerox.Here’s a rundown of what analysts are saying.Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his rating on the stock to Buy from Hold, with a new target of $28, up from $19. He says the company’s announcements provide various scenarios that could allow the stock to keep rising.HP stock was up 7% to $23.64 on Tuesday.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani maintained an Outperform rating and $26 target on the stock. HP “presented a credible and aggressive shareholder return policy that is an attractive alternative to the Xerox $24 a share offer, which would be done heavily on HP’s balance sheet,” he wrote in a research note. He says he continues to “see the path higher for the stock.”Barclays analyst Tim Long kept an Equal Weight rating, but raised his price target to $25 from $19. He said the stock-repurchase plan and a poison pill HP recently announced together “make it harder for Xerox to acquire HP.” He remained cautious on the stock given “elevated uncertainties as well as continued secular challenges in printing.”J.P. Morgan’s Paul Coster likewise kept a Neutral rating, but raised his target to $24 from $20. “HP remains open to merger discussions with Xerox, but we sense a high bar and an eagerness to quickly pivot to this go-it-alone strategy,” he wrote. ‘We raise estimates…but we think the stock is trading close to full value.”Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty stuck with her Equal Weight rating, bumping her price target to $24, from $21. “Investors have been concerned about slowing commercial PC growth and a messy transition away from the historical razor / blade printer model as HP shifts value toward printer hardware in some markets,” she wrote. But she added that the company has outlined how “earnings will grow even without top-line or mix-driven profit expansion.” She notes that “a combination with Xerox is by no means off the table,” and that management “left open the possibility of making an acquisition of Xerox’s size.”Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong kept his Hold rating, but raised his target price to $24, from $22. He contends that Xerox now looks more like a target than a buyer. Were HP to acquire Xerox, he noted, it could require HP to slow its plan to aggressively return capital to shareholders. “Questions remain, with no easy answers,” he wrote. “With potential downside to HP’s stock should the deal-talks fall apart in the near term, coupled with possible upside from present levels should a combination be negotiated, we continue to view HP’s risk-reward as balanced.”Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral, who has a Neutral rating and $22 target on the stock, still finds issues. He noted that the 6.7% operating margin in the computer business was the highest in his records, which date to 2003. But he sees increasing headwinds from a fading Windows 10 refresh cycle and an expected rise in memory-chip prices. While he thinks consolidation makes sense, he said HP’s poison-pill rights plan announced last week “effectively neutralizes Xerox’s proposed tender and likely extends the focus to the upcoming proxy fight, unless a negotiated transaction emerges.” Write to Eric J.

0,"The financial markets are reeling—and investors are reeling with them. Slammed by generational volatility, many stocks look like bargains. But who can stomach jumping into the water when the waves are pushing the stock-market seas up and down 5% or more each day? Picking winners and losers in this environment might feel like a fool’s errand. But starting to sort through the sea of opportunity is a wise idea. To help stay engaged in this market, investors should embrace the power of the stock screen to find names with the right mix of factors for this moment. Even in good times, stock screens are one of the most useful tools an investor has. They can yield a funnel of new ideas, even if one shouldn’t buy a stock based on a screen alone. In calmer times, some investors look for faster-than-average growth, while others favor cheaper-than-average valuation multiples. In the Covid-19 storm, traditional screens look inadequate. Screening for multiple factors simultaneously will help. Using a mix is a little like two-factor authentication, which made the digital world far safer. As many remote workers can already attest, users enter passwords and then get texts or emails with confirmation codes. It reduces the chances for nasty surprises, such as identity theft. For our multifactor stock-authentication screen, we settled on a combination of cash flow, debt, earnings growth, and valuation. That would help us get rid of bargain stocks that were cheap for a reason, or avoid paying through the nose for fortress balance sheets. As a proxy for cash-flow stability, we looked for        S&P 500      companies that generated positive free cash flow in 2008 and 2009—during the financial crisis. Cash generating ability is at a premium again as Covid-19 dramatically slows the economy. We then kept only the companies with below-average debt and an absence of large, near-term debt maturities. Finally, we kept only those with below-average valuations and a demonstrated ability to grow earnings. In other words, we wanted a history of growth at a reasonable price.About 40 companies made the cut. Turning a stock screen into stock selection is more art than science. We took the relatively more attractive stocks across many sectors, and we looked for any additional catalysts that might boost stock performance down the road. Our final 12, in no particular order:            Caterpillar      (CAT),            Merck      (MRK),            UnitedHealth      (UNH),            Intel      (INTC),            Honeywell International      (HON),            Best Buy      (BBY),            W.W. Grainger      (GWW),            D.R. Horton      (DHI),            Qualcomm      (QCOM),            Akamai Technologies      (AKAM),            Lockheed Martin      (LMT),            BlackRock      (BLK). The dozen are down about 18% year to date, a little better than the drop of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      They have little debt, on average, and trade at a 25% discount to their own valuation history. And each has a story. Caterpillar makes diggers and dump trucks and bulldozers, huge machines ordered months in advance. It’s what is known as a long-cycle industrial business. Bank of America analyst Ross Gilardi cut his 2020 Cat earnings estimates Friday—the virus impacts everyone—but he noted the company had a strong balance sheet and a 4% dividend yield. Grainger is an industrial distributor, selling lots of small-ticket items that turn over quickly. The company, historically, has generated growth and cash flow in most economic environments, in part because it can swiftly scale operations up or down, depending on demand. It also sells a lot of safety products, like masks and cleaning solutions—items in high demand today. The stock trades for about 14 times estimated earnings, a discount to the broader market’s 15.8 times. Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, isn’t completely dependent on the health of the broader economy. And in the case of Merck and            UnitedHealth      —two health-care stocks—the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic front-runner has eliminated some of the political risk for the sector. Yes, this time is different. In the past 80 years, we’ve faced wars, banking crises, and recessions. We haven’t dealt with a global pandemic that threatens to grind the global economy to a halt. But even now, opportunities are revealing themselves. Investors just need a place to start.

All Rights ReservedRevenue and profit estimates for the semiconductor industry continue to ratchet lower, amid a range of both supply-chain and demand issues. And the same process is under way for the chip equipment makers that serve them. But for both sectors, there are values to find if you know where to look.This morning, UBS chip analyst Timothy Arcuri reset estimates for his entire coverage universe, which includes all of the major chip and equipment companies. For most of the companies he covers, he reduced revenue forecasts for both 2020 and 2021, and he brought price targets down for most of the stocks he covers as well. He also shifted some ratings around. In a few cases, he’s feeling more bullish.Arcuri notes that revenue for the semiconductor industry fell 35% in two quarters during the 2008-09 downturn, and took three quarters to fully recover. But he adds that comparisons are easier this time, coming off a weak 2019, especially for memory chips. He writes that his new base case is for a 20% drop in semiconductor revenues through the September quarter with a gradual recovery to parity by June 2021. Calendar 2020 revenues, he says, will be off 15%-20% from pre-virus estimates. He adds that “computer” related stocks—            Intel       (ticker: INTC) and            Nvidia       (NVDA), for instance—should be more defensive, and that supply constraints should help on memory. (He likes            Micron.      ) But he sees risks for smartphone-related stocks, and weakness in the automotive chip sector.For the equipment sector, he says, revenue will follow semis lower, but he’s more bullish on the group than he is on chips. He says that “supply constraints should keep order books full making the snap-back faster than for semis,” and he adds that there are “few if any weak balance sheets among top chip spenders.” Arcuri also notes that Chinese customers “remain full speed ahead and may even accelerate timeliness.”Arcuri on Friday lifted his ratings on            Lam Research      (LRCX) to Buy from Sell and on            KLA       (KLAC) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) to Neutral from Sell. He also upgrades            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Neutral from Sell.His bullish stance on Lam reflects the company’s out-sized exposure to the memory sector. He writes that Applied has growing exposure to memory, though he is concerned about the company’s display business, and he sees risk in its large exposure to the contract chip manufacturer            Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM). He says KLA should get a boost from supply constraint issues in the equipment sector, though he thinks the story in the foundry and logic end markets—where KLA has significant exposure—isn’t as compelling as it is for memory.On Texas Instruments, Arcuri says that he still has concerns about their big exposure to the automotive and industrial vertical markets, but that the issue is already reflected in the stock price. “Virtually all of the company’s revenue growth over the past 4 years has come from this vertical so this remains a concern as we look forward but the sell side has also been aggressively cutting global production estimates over the past few weeks and highly visible production shut-downs in Europe make it hard to argue that investors have not contemplated this as a risk,” he writes.In Friday trading, amid a sharp market slide, chip and equipment stocks are trading lower across the board, with Lam, Arcuri’s favorite, down 6.4%, to $243.42.

0,"Add servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedMany companies have suspended or cut dividends in recent weeks as the coronavirus outbreak has severely curtailed business, and hundreds more are possible in coming weeks and months. Beyond the basic need to conserve cash while business is depressed, the stimulus bill reportedly aims to restrict certain companies’ ability to pay dividends.“No companies were built to withstand zero revenue for an extended period of time,” says Bill Nygren, portfolio co-manager of the Oakmark fund (ticker: OAKMX). He calls the current market turmoil “uncharted territory.” Among the large U.S. companies that already have suspended their dividends are            Marriott International      (MAR),            Ford Motor      (F),            Nordstrom      (JWN), and            Boeing      (BA). Marriott and Nordstrom said the suspensions will take effect next quarter.IHS Markit      is forecasting that 230 of the largest 1,800 global companies will suspend their dividends.Even that gloomy assessment, however, doesn’t mean dividends are dead everywhere. “There are plenty of opportunities to find equity income right now,” says David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, though he cautions that it depends on the individual company and sector. “You have to make sure the company in which you are investing is well-capitalized.”Kelly is expecting a spike in unemployment, as major parts of the economy shut down, meaning companies’ cash flow is sure to take a hit. He says, however, that it’s important to take a long-term view—difficult though that is amid a “grim short-term outlook.”“There are plenty of sectors that will get through in a tough scenario,” Kelly says, pointing to financials and health care as examples.Nygren also likes financials, with a caveat. He says banks are “high on the list of attractive yields, but if the shutdown goes on long enough, I guess you’d have to add them to the vulnerable list.”Nygren says that two of his holdings “that seem to be less hurt by the shutdown than most” are            Texas Instruments      (TXN) and            CVS Health      (CVS). Both stocks recently yielded 3.6%. One potential silver lining for income investors during the pandemic’s gloom is the growing list of companies that are suspending their buybacks while maintaining their dividends, at least for now. Many of the large U.S. banks—along with companies in other sectors—have done that. For instance, energy firm            Chevron      (CVX) plans to suspend buybacks and slash capital spending by $4 billion, or 20%, as part of an effort to protect its dividend and support its balance sheet. The stock yields 7.2%. Chevron has been paying $1.29 a share per quarter, having declared an 8% boost in late January.Chip maker            Intel      (INTC) also said this week that it’s suspending buybacks to preserve its payout. The company said in a securities filing that the buyback suspension “will not impact dividend payments to stockholders and that the company has the ability to reinstate repurchases as circumstances warrant.” The stock yields nearly 2.5%.Elsewhere,            Dick’s Sporting Goods      (DKS), which yields nearly 6%, said in a filing Wednesday that it’s temporarily suspending its stock buybacks and evaluating its dividend. Retailing has been hit hard by the pandemic’s fallout, and more dividend suspensions in the sector are likely. One consolation: Dick’s said it plans to pay out its quarterly dividend of 31.25 cents a share on its common stock Friday for stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20.Whether it will deliver its dividend next quarter, or join many other companies in cutting, is a question that will be answered as the coronavirus toll becomes clearer. b Write to Lawrence C.

0,"Semiconductor shares were leading the market higher on a strong rebound day for the broader market Tuesday, as analysts and investors sort through the rubble of the downturn looking for likely winners coming out it. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised his rating Tuesday morning on            Nvidia       shares (ticker: NVDA) to Buy from Hold, setting a price target of $270. “We acknowledge it’s risky to upgrade a stock given this vicious pandemic and the subsequent economic fallout,” he writes in a research note. “However, during this uncertain time, we believe investors will flock to companies with superior balance sheets and robust free cash flow. Nvidia fits the bill.”Gill expects a pickup in demand for Nvidia graphics processors used for medical research applications in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. “GPUs can accelerate the analysis of whole genomes, which consist of 3 billion base pairs in human chromosomes, from days to less than one hour,” he writes. Gill also notes that with the stock down 35% from its peak as of Monday’s close, the stock trades at a multiyear P/E low.Goldman Sachs chip analyst Toshiya Hari chopped estimates across the board on Tuesday for both chip companies and semiconductor-equipment stocks—but he has a few stocks to recommend. Hari’s estimate cuts are driven by recent downward revisions in the outlook for key markets served by the chip industry. Goldman Sachs sees smartphone shipments this year down 1.4% from 2019, personal computer shipments off 10% and automotive sales down 3.5%. Hari writes that he has taken an approach of cutting estimates based on how various groups have fared in past recessions. “While we take no view on the development of Covid-19 and the impact it could have on end demand, and in turn, the semiconductor industry, we believe it is prudent to assume a peak-to-trough correction that is consistent with past downturns.”In reviewing the group, Hari shuffled some ratings, lifting his stance on            Xilinx       (XLNX) to Buy from Neutral and            Intel      (INTC) to Neutral from Sell. But he cut            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Sell from Neutral, and            Cabot Microelectronics      (CCMP) to Neutral from Buy. He also removed            Applied Materials      (AMAT) from Goldman’s conviction list, while keeping his Buy rating on the equipment company.Xilinx makes field-programmable gate arrays, parts used in communications, data center, aerospace and other applications. While Hari says Xilinx isn’t immune to a downturn, he contends that the underperformance of Xilinx shares over the past 3, 6 and 12 months reduces the stock’s risk. He thinks fundamentals in the communications sector are “at or near trough,” and writes that data center remains “a secular growth business.” Hari contends that other key sectors for Xilinx—aerospace and defense—in addition to test and instruments are less economically sensitive than other chip end markets. The analyst also notes that Xilinx, as a chip maker that doesn’t operate its own factories, “has historically demonstrated relative gross margin stability during economic downturns” and that “relative valuation multiples are near-trough” levels. Hari concludes that any signs of improving earnings should drive an outsize gain in Xilinx shares. For Texas Instruments, Hari cut his price target to $88 from $123. He notes that the stock is often perceived as a haven, but that weakness in many of its key end markets as well as “above-peer operating leverage,” given it operates its own factories, “should pressure margins over the next few quarters and drive negative earnings-per-share revisions in excess of those for its peers.”As for Intel, Hari writes that there are “multiple near-term positive developments that could largely offset the headwinds,” including resilience in the server market and potentially in personal computers as more people work and study from home. But he says that because of increased competition, growing capital intensity and pressure on margins, he would avoid overweighting the stock.The downgrade of Cabot Micro, Hari says, reflects a special situation. The company’s core electronics materials business, which makes slurries used in chip-making, “is a high-growth, high margin business with a deep/wide competitive moat, and one that we continue to view positively long term.” But the company also makes drag reducing agents, or DRAs, used by oil pipelines. And he sees Cabot feeling the impact on that business as oil pipeline operators in the Permian Basin reduce their use of DRAs. Hari notes that Cabot is down 78% from its highs in February, but that “uncertainty surrounding the DRA business” will likely “weigh on multiples for the foreseeable future.”Near midday Tuesday, Nvidia was up 18%, Intel up 7.5% and Xilinx gained 6.2%. Texas Instruments rallied 5.4%, Cabot climbed 4% and Applied Materials jumped 12.6%. The        PHLX Semiconductor Stock Index      (SOX) rallied 10% and the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      had climbed 8.6%. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedIntel       has suspended its stock repurchase plan to conserve its resources for other needs as it copes with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In a filing with the SEC, the chip maker said that, to date, “Intel has kept its factories operational while safeguarding the health and safety of employees and continues to have a strong balance sheet.” But the company said the suspension of the buyback plan “is prudent given uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the pandemic.”Intel said it isn’t changing its dividend rate—the stock (ticker: INTC) yields about 2.9%—and still has capacity to reinstate purchasers “as circumstances warrant.”The company announced a $20 billion repurchase plan in October 2019. It bought $7.6 billion in shares in the 2019 fourth quarter and the 2020 first quarter combined, before the suspension. Intel also noted that it has added a Covid-19 related section to the risk factors in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC.In that disclosure, Intel said measures taken globally to contain the spread of the coronavirus “have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers.” It noted that it has “significant manufacturing operations in the U.S., Ireland, Israel, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and each of these countries has been affected by the outbreak and taken measures to try to contain it.”Intel also said that “the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that the current outbreak or continued spread of Covid-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession.”The company said it has modified its business practices in response to the virus but that “there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.” “The degree to which Covid-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.”Amid a broad market rebound Tuesday morning, Intel shares were up 6% to $52.58.

1,"As the coronavirus pandemic decimates corporate America and the broader economy, U.S. businesses across industries are suspending or paring dividends and halting stock-buyback programs. Some of these moves are being driven by an urgent need to conserve cash amid dwindling revenue, but there is also a political undercurrent to some of the corporate moves. Some lawmakers are calling for a ban on stock repurchases in industries such as airlines that stand to receive government assistance to weather the crisis. To get a sense of the numbers, consider that the initial coronavirus rescue package is seen by the administration as costing roughly $2 trillion. From 2017 through 2019, members of the S&P 500 spent more than $2 trillion on stock buybacks. On the dividend front, U.S. payouts rose 4.7% in 2019 to a record $491 billion.The dividend and buyback suspensions are likely to continue as the economy goes into a deep recession and sales crater, squeezing households, businesses, governments and the health-care system.Here is a running list of how companies and industries are managing their dividend payments and stock-buyback programs: Wendy’s      (ticker: WEN) suspended share repurchases and said its capital plan and general expenditures are under review for cost-saving measures. The fast-food chain also said it has drawn down its full $120 million revolving financing facility, bringing its cash on hand total to more than $340 million. Coach parent            Tapestry      (TPR) said it is suspending its dividend from the fourth quarter and halting its share-buyback program. The company is tapping $700 million of its $900 million revolving credit facility. Alaska Air Group      (ALK) said it is suspending its cash dividend, has drawn $400 million on a line of credit and secured an additional loan for $425 million. As part of cost-cutting moves, executives will take pay cuts—including a 100% reduction for CEO Bradley Tilden—annual pay raises for employees will be suspended and the company will solicit voluntary leaves of absences from workers.Texas Roadhouse      (TXRH) said it was suspending quarterly dividends “to better manage its cash position” due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic.Another restaurant operator,            Cracker Barrel Old Country Store      (CBRL), said it was deferring a previously declared dividend and suspending its regular dividend program. •            Chevron      (CVX) will suspend its stock buybacks and reduce capital spending by $4 billion this year to account for the recent plunge in oil prices, the company announced on Tuesday. But Chevron will maintain its dividend, a key selling point for investors. The stock now yields 9.5%.•            ﻿Intel      (INTC) has suspended its stock repurchase plan to conserve its resources for other needs as it copes with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In a filing with the SEC, the chip maker said that, to date, “Intel has kept its factories operational while safeguarding the health and safety of employees and continues to have a strong balance sheet.” But the company said the suspension of the buyback plan “is prudent given uncertainty regarding the length and severity of the pandemic.”﻿      • Department-store chain Nordstrom (JWN) said it is suspending share repurchases and, starting in its fiscal second quarter, its quarterly dividend. The company has been paying a quarterly payout of 37 cents a share.• Mining firm            Freeport-McMoRan      (FCX) said it’s suspending the first-quarter dividend on its common stock. The company has been paying a quarterly dividend of 5 cents a share.•            DCP Midstream      (ticker: DCP), a company that operates natural-gas processing facilities and pipelines, announced that it would cut its dividend in half “in response to extraordinary and volatile market conditions.” The company said the cut would free up $325 million “that will be fully utilized to reduce leverage and strengthen the balance sheet.” •            AT&T      (T) on Friday announced that it has canceled a previously disclosed $4 billion accelerated share-repurchase agreement, as well as “any other repurchases.”•            Bank of America       (BAC) was among eight large U.S. banks—including            Bank of New York Mellon      (BK),            Citigroup      (C),            Goldman Sachs      (GS),            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM),            Morgan Stanley      (MS),            State Street      (STT), and            Wells Fargo      (WFC)—to suspend their share buybacks for the rest of the first quarter and the second quarter of 2020. • Electronics retailer            Best Buy      (BBY) said in a statement March 21 that it has suspended all share repurchases. The company did not say anything about the dividend.• On March 20,            Boeing      (ticker: BA) said it would suspend its dividend and buybacks as it seeks to conserve cash while requesting government assistance.•            Darden Restaurants      (DRI) on Thursday said it’s suspending its quarterly payout.•            Delta Air Lines      (DAL), in a filing on March 20, said that “When the extent of the Covid-19 crisis became clear, we immediately suspended our share repurchases, and our board of directors have voted to suspend future dividend payments.” •            Ford Motor      (F) is suspending its dividend as it closes its manufacturing operations in North America.•            Macy’s      (M), on March 20, said it would suspend its dividend following its payout on April 1.•            Marriott International      (MAR) announced Thursday that it will suspend its dividend, though the one it had declared previously for the first quarter will be paid.•            McDonald’s      (MCD) suspended its share repurchases but its CEO said it would keep paying its dividend.•            Targa Resources      (TRGP), a master limited partnership, announced a dividend cut last Thursday, to 10 cents a quarter from 91 cents.

0,"The semiconductor sector could see earnings fall as much as 70% on average if the coronavirus pandemic triggers a global recession, according to Citi.“We believe it is time to assume a recession is coming given the extreme disruption happening to several businesses,” analyst Christopher Danely writes in a new research note. “As a result, we analyzed how far estimates fell in past downturns. We are not lowering estimates as we believe this is an exercise in futility given we’ll just have to change them again in a month and it is impossible to gauge how bad things can get.”Danely writes that his analysis of previous downturns from 2008-2019 indicates average consensus estimates can fall as much as 70% on average—with some declining 100%. In the 2008 downturn, the mean chip stock earnings estimate fell 70%—and the        PHLX Semiconductor Stock      Index, fell a stunning 88%, drastically outpacing the 39% decline in the        S&P 500.      The analyst says the companies in his coverage universe that have historical had the smallest cuts to estimates are            Xilinx      (ticker: XLNX) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), noting that both also have been among the best-performing stocks in a downturn. He thinks Xilinx will see relatively small estimate cuts this time, but that Qualcomm could have issues “given all the demand destruction in cellphones.”Danely says the largest cuts to earnings estimates historically have been suffered by            Micron      Technology (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). He thinks AMD again is likely to suffer among the largest estimate cuts, but Micron “might buck the trend.”The companies that interest Danely the most right now are            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and Micron. “Texas Instruments has been among the best performers so far during the downturn and we would expect that to continue,” he writes. “Microchip has been among the worst performers but we believe it is unwarranted and would aggressively buy the stock. We also believe Micron might buck the trend given the oligopoly in DRAM and strength in the server end market.”He also notes that “checks indicate server demand has remained strong throughout the volatile order patterns, due...to trends of more people working from home and online demand for various products.” That’s good news for            Intel      (INTC), AMD, and Micron.Semiconductor stocks have recovered more than 6.5% on Tuesday, well ahead of the 4.7% rebound by the S&P 500.

1,"Starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, most residents of the San Francisco Bay Area will be subject to a “shelter in place” order issued this afternoon by the region’s public health officials, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The order will continue at least until April 7. It affects San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Costa Costa and Alameda counties, an area with a combined population of 6.7 million people. The region includes the headquarters of many of the country’s largest technology companies, including            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Facebook      (FB), Alphabet (GOOG),            Intel,Cisco Systems      (CSCO),            Netflix      and many others. Not initially included in the order are Sonoma, Napa and Solano counties.All nonessential gatherings of any size will be banned, along with nonessential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit.” People may travel for shopping for necessary supplies, health care, and providing aid to family and friends who need assistance, and for non-residents returning to their home outside the Bay Area. Airports, taxis, and public transit will remain operational, but only for essential travel.People in the affected area will still be able to shop for food and household supplies, and to seek medical care. They will be able to go outside for walks or exercise as long as they keep six feet away from anyone they don’t already live with.Older residents and those with underlying health problems are to stay inside at all times except for health care. The order calls for “routine medical appointments” and elective procedures to be canceled or rescheduled. Businesses allowed to operate during this period, according to the San Jose Mercury News, include health-care providers; businesses that provide food, shelter, and social services; food retailers, including convenience stores; pharmacies; child-care facilities; gas stations; banks; laundries; and businesses necessary for maintaining the safety, sanitation and essential operation of a residence.Santa Clara County had 114 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Monday morning.

0,"As fears grow that coronavirus will evolve into a global pandemic, the list of canceled events grows by the day. The technology industry has been especially hard hit; Mobile World Congress—one of the year’s largest tech conferences—was among the first cancellations. On Wednesday, E3, the video game industry’s largest annual event, was canceled. It had been scheduled for June 9-11 in Los Angeles. “Following increased and overwhelming concerns about the COVID-19 virus, we felt this was the best way to proceed during such an unprecedented global situation,” the conference organizers said. Late last week, music and digital media conference South by Southwest was canceled by order of the city of Austin, Tex. Many of the headline companies had already pulled out of the event by the time the conference was cancelled. More than 400,000 people attended the event last year.On Saturday, organizers of the Milken Institute Global Conference said the 23rd annual gathering is being rescheduled to July 7-10. The Los Angeles-based event, which includes business, government, and academic leaders, was originally planned for May 2-6.In a blow to music fans, the 2020 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, scheduled for April 10-19 in Indio, Calif., has been postponed until October. “While this decision comes at a time of universal uncertainty,” event organizers said, “we take the safety and health of our guests, staff, and community very seriously.Sports leagues are beginning to weigh the impact of coronavirus, as well. Organizers of the Indian Wells tennis tournament, which was scheduled to start Wednesday, March 11 has been postponed. The event usually draws upwards of 450,000 fans. This year’s field had included Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Serena Williams.

1,"Technology stocks led the market’s rally to record heights, but the largest tech names have been swept up by the recent selling wave. Most of the leading tech companies now at or near bear market declines, down roughly 20% from their mid-February highs.The        S&P 500 Information Technology      sector closed at 1440.20 on Monday, down exactly 20% from its Feb. 19 peak. The info tech sector doesn’t include all of big tech -- (            Facebook      ticker: FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are in the Communications Services sector, for instance -- but the pain is generally universally. Microsoft      (MSFT) and            Apple      (AAPL) are hanging on to their position as the only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion, but both have suffered in the recent selloff. Microsoft is down 4.5% year to date, and off more than 20% from its closing high in mid-February. Bear markets are defined as drops of 20% or more. Apple is down 9% year to date and almost 19% below its recent peak.Amazon      (AMZN) and Alphabet, both of which made brief appearances above the $1 trillion market level, have since fallen substantially. Amazon has performed relatively better than the other tech giants, but it’s still off 2.6% for the year and 17% from last month’s peak. Facebook (FB), the fifth largest U.S. company by market cap, is down 17% year to date, and 22% from its February highs.Cisco      (CSCO), the largest networking equipment company, is down 21% for the year and 24% from its February highs.

Salesforce.com      (CRM) is off 7% for the year and 22% from a February high.Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), which has become a popular play on the rush to remote meetings in the face of the rapid spread of coronavirus, was down just a fraction on Monday and remains 67% higher on the year.            RingCentral      (RING), a unified communications company which resells Zoom’s videoconferencing services, fell 3% Monday, but it’s still up 24% for the year. Netflix      (NFLX), seen by some investors as a bet on more people choosing to find entertainment at home, was down 6% Monday, but it remains 7% higher for the year.

1,"Advanced Micro Devices      shares are trading higher Tuesday after Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar upped his rating on the microprocessor company’s stock to Overweight from Neutral, with a new price target of $56, up from $45.AMD shares (ticker: AMD) had dropped 19% from their peak on Feb. 19 through Monday’s close. Kumar contends that the pullback—triggered by concerns over the coronavirus—“provides an attractive opportunity for long-term investors.” Kumar trimmed his near-term estimates to reflect the impact of the virus, but raised his long-term estimates. “From a product standpoint, we believe AMD is extremely well positioned in its laptop/desktop and data center markets, and we see several tailwinds in these markets to provide significant growth over the next several years,” he writes in a research note. “The company has established a solid cadence of new product introductions over the last few years, and we believe customers are more than comfortable with AMD’s product set. In addition, we expect AMD to continue to gain share from            Intel      INTC over the next several years, as the company now offers as good or better performance at roughly the same cost in many of its competing markets.”Kumar trimmed his 2020 earnings-per-share forecast to $1.09, from $1.13, but lifts his 2021 view to $1.59, from $1.49. He argues the company can earn $1.93 a share in 2022. Street consensus estimates are $1.15 a share for 2020 and $1.58 for 2021.

0,"Analysts generally expect            Dell Technologies      to post strong results Thursday for its fiscal fourth quarter ended in January, but there are concerns that the company’s guidance for the April quarter and beyond could be dinged by the coronavirus crisis.Wall Street analyst consensus estimates call for fourth-quarter revenue of $24 billion and non-GAAP profits of $2.02 per Dell share (ticker: DELL), leading to full-year revenue of $92.2 billion and profits of $7.34 a share. Dell’s full-year guidance was for $91.5 billion to $92.2 billion in revenue and non-GAAP profits of $7.25 to $7.40 a share.Current April-quarter consensus calls for revenue of $22.2 billion and non-GAAP profits of $1.45 a share. The Street is projecting fiscal-year 2021 revenues of $93 billion with profits of $6.71 a share. This week’s stronger-than-expected January-quarter performance by            HP Inc.      (HPQ)—which was driven in particular by better-than-expected margins in personal computers—suggests the story could be a strong one for Dell’s January results. PC makers have been benefiting from a combination of the tail-end of the Microsoft Windows 10 upgrade cycle, which has been driving incremental PC demand, and recently depressed prices for memory chips. Tight supplies of            Intel      (INTC) processors has also helped keep prices firm. Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong on Wednesday tweaked his Dell earnings model, inching up expectations for the January quarter based in part on “memory tailwinds,” while trimming estimates for April and the 2021 fiscal year to reflect expectations that Dell will take a conservative view on the impact of coronavirus. Read more: Dell Is a Top Stock for 2020. Here’s Why. “Overall, we remain concerned with the CPU constraints and coronavirus impacts on Dell’s business, especially if they continue longer than expected,” Ong writes in a research note. “However, we believe that Dell has a number of under-appreciated offsets (market share gains vs. peers, valuation downside protection, de-leveraging potential) and therefore maintain our bullish stance.” He keeps a Buy rating, while trimming his price target to $58 from $60. J.P. Morgan’s      Paul Coster expects a “solid” January earnings report driven by healthy PC shipments, “on possible pull in demand coupled with market share gains.” And he says recent earnings reports from both HP and            Lenovo Group      (992.Hong Kong) suggest “solid margin performance” is likely. But he trimmed his April-quarter outlook to reflect the likely impact from the virus—his forecast is now for revenue of $21.8 billion with non-GAAP profits of $1.30 a share, below the current consensus. Coster keeps an Overweight rating, while reducing his price target to $65 from $70.But Coster adds that with the stock trading at 7.7 times estimated calendar0year 2020 Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), “Dell looks somewhat undervalued.” And he says that the stock also looks undervalued on a sum-of-the-parts basis, given Dell’s share of publicly held subsidiaries—in particular            VMware      (VMW)—account for about $50 billion of market cap—well in excess of Dell’s own $35 billion market cap, though Dell also has about $49 billion in long-term debt. Writes Coster: “We think Dell stock can re-rate higher on continued solid execution and paydown of debt.”Dell stock is up 1.8%, at $47.04, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      is up 1.6%.

1,"With health workers nationwide running low on masks and other protective gear, a growing list of technology companies are locating their own supplies and donating them to those on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, a            SoftBank Group      (SFTBY) executive announced on Twitter that the company is donating 1.4 million N95 respirator masks to the State of New York. A spokesperson for SoftBank said the company obtained the masks specifically to donate them to the state. SoftBank’s announcement—and those from other tech firms—stands out given the shortage in medical supplies across the country. On March 17, the attorneys general of Massachusetts, New York, and California wrote a letter to President Trump asking the government for help in obtaining masks, eye protection, gowns, and gloves as the pandemic spreads. “We are in the early days of this public health crisis and are already facing a significant shortage of necessary protective medical gear,” the AGs said in the letter. “Some hospital officials in Massachusetts are instructing workers to begin reusing N95 respirator masks to conserve rapidly dwindling supplies.”Apple      (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook tweeted on Saturday that the company is donating “millions of masks” for health professionals in the U.S. and Europe.            Facebook      (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Saturday said his company is donating an emergency reserve of 720,000 masks that Facebook had accumulated in response to the recent California wildfires. Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff tweeted on Saturday that the company has donated 9,000 masks to the hospital at the University of California San Francisco—and that it plans to deliver another five million masks this week, along with other protective gear to Bay Area hospitals. Other companies pitching in include            PG&E      (PCG) with 950,000 masks, Elon Musk’s SpaceX and            Tesla      (TSLA) with 250,000 masks, Flexport with 60,000 masks, and            IBM      (IBM) with 15,000 masks.Technology companies often have deep logistical networks, particularly in China, where many medical masks are produced. A search of Alibaba.com—the English language website of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group—includes many listings for N95 masks, some offering quantities in the tens of thousands. The tech donations represent a small share of the needed supplies. The letter from state attorneys general cited a need for 12 billion masks “to protect those on the front lines over the course of this epidemic.”  Write to Eric J.

1,"With the stock market in full freak-out mode, most investors are ignoring analyst advice on individual issues—every stock now looks a lot cheaper than it was a month ago, or even a week ago. The news that matters is macro in nature—the focus is on the coronavirus outbreak, not incremental improvements in cash flow estimates. That dynamic has spurred some Wall Street pundits to get philosophical—and to coach investors on sticking to their guns on companies with compelling investment stories.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who covers a wide range of tech names, took the barbell approach in a research note this morning, trying to pull back to the 30,000-foot level, while also offering some practical suggestions on stocks to buy while everything is on sale.“Across the tech space the red screens are front and center for investors as the panic, fear, and worries about a coronavirus-driven economic downturn continue to pressure stocks across the board,” he writes. “Our investing philosophy in times of crisis is to do a bottoms up analysis and stress test the models of our top tech names/themes vs. a sensitivity in valuations. If stocks stick out with a green light based on this exercise and framework, we hand hold investors to buy these dips through this volatility, own the names for the other side of this panic, and see the forest through the trees on the fundamental drivers for the next decade in tech.”Ives thinks that a “surge of strategic and financial buyer driven M&A could be on the horizon over the coming months as valuations start to reach levels which can ignite a long-overdue deal frenzy that could start to put a floor on the software sector as well.” He thinks            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT), Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google,            IBM      (IBM),            Adobe      (ADBE) and            Oracle      (ORCL) could all look to take advantage of their strong balance sheets to beef up their cloud portfolios.Ives writes that he remains bullish on cloud computing, 5G wireless handsets, and cybersecurity. “Does an economic slowdown impact these models and valuations? The answer is a clear yes,” he writes. “However, looking past the fear and panic (and a potential short-lived economic dent/softness), we believe these high-priority areas of spending and business models have attractive risk/rewards looking ahead and we would be buying these tech names at current levels.”His picks: Write to Eric J.

0,"Slack Technologies      will interrupt the market’s single-minded focus on coronavirus—at least briefly—when the communications software company reports January quarter results after the close of trading on Thursday.Slack’s (ticker: WORK) volatile shares have been seen by some investors as a stay-at-home play, benefiting from an increased number of people working from home because of coronavirus. The same theory has boosted shares of            Zoom Video Communications      (ZM) and            RingCentral      (RNG). While Slack stock remains modestly higher year to date, at a recent $25.13, the shares remain well below a close of $38.62 on their first day of trading last June. Investors remain concerned about Slack’s competitive position versus            Microsoft      (MSFT) Teams.For the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, Slack has forecast revenue of $172 million to $174 million, with a non-GAAP loss of 6 cents to 7 cents a share. The Wall Street analyst consensus forecast is slightly above the guidance range, at a loss of 5 cents on revenue of $174.1 million.For the January 2021 fiscal year, Slack sees revenue of $621 million to $623 million, with a non-GAAP loss of 31 cents to 32 cents a share. Slack sees full-year billings of $745 million to $760 million, representing year-over-year growth of 44% to 47%.Slack reported October quarter revenue of $168.7 million, up 60% from a year ago, with a non-GAAP loss of 2 cents a share.Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White contends that despite a rough debut in the public market, Slack “remains one of the fastest growing companies in our coverage with a large market opportunity.” White thinks fourth-quarter revenue will top his forecast of $174.2 million; he maintains a Buy rating and $41 target price. “After a disappointing 2019, Slack’s stock has experienced the best performance in our coverage universe thus far in 2020, while holding up relatively well during the recent market turmoil,” White wrote in a research note. “The combination of low expectations after a challenged 2019, the ramp of shared channels, a growing appetite for collaboration tools within organizations dealing with coronavirus-related travel restrictions, and positive media reports have positively impacted Slack’s stock this year.”Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss thinks Slack shares could benefit from recent positive news on widespread adoption of Slack ‘s software by            IBM      (IBM) and            Uber Technologies      (UBER). But Weiss adds that he remains convinced that competitor Microsoft Teams is better positioned than Slack, given Microsoft’s long-term relationships with enterprise customers and the fact that Teams is bundled into Office 365. “Enterprise traction for Teams is also driven by tight integration with Microsoft products as well as best-in-class security, compliance, and administrative controls,” he writes. Weiss keeps his Equal Weighting and $28 target price on Slack stock.Slack shares are up about 11% year to date, to $25.06. Write to Eric J.

1,"Technology stocks led the market’s rally to record heights, but the largest tech names have been swept up by the recent selling wave. Most of the leading tech companies now at or near bear market declines, down roughly 20% from their mid-February highs.The        S&P 500 Information Technology      sector closed at 1440.20 on Monday, down exactly 20% from its Feb. 19 peak. The info tech sector doesn’t include all of big tech -- (            Facebook      ticker: FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are in the Communications Services sector, for instance -- but the pain is generally universally. Microsoft      (MSFT) and            Apple      (AAPL) are hanging on to their position as the only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion, but both have suffered in the recent selloff. Microsoft is down 4.5% year to date, and off more than 20% from its closing high in mid-February. Bear markets are defined as drops of 20% or more. Apple is down 9% year to date and almost 19% below its recent peak.Amazon      (AMZN) and Alphabet, both of which made brief appearances above the $1 trillion market level, have since fallen substantially. Amazon has performed relatively better than the other tech giants, but it’s still off 2.6% for the year and 17% from last month’s peak. Facebook (FB), the fifth largest U.S. company by market cap, is down 17% year to date, and 22% from its February highs.Cisco      (CSCO), the largest networking equipment company, is down 21% for the year and 24% from its February highs.            Intel      (INTC), the leading chip maker, is off 15% for the year and almost 25% from its peak last month. IBM      (IBM), which got a lift from its recent announcement of a CEO change, is still down 12% year to date, and 24% from the stock’s February high.            Oracle      (ORCL), which only fell 3% Monday, is down 13% year to date, and 17% from its recent peak.            Salesforce.com      (CRM) is off 7% for the year and 22% from a February high.Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), which has become a popular play on the rush to remote meetings in the face of the rapid spread of coronavirus, was down just a fraction on Monday and remains 67% higher on the year.            RingCentral      (RING), a unified communications company which resells Zoom’s videoconferencing services, fell 3% Monday, but it’s still up 24% for the year. Netflix      (NFLX), seen by some investors as a bet on more people choosing to find entertainment at home, was down 6% Monday, but it remains 7% higher for the year.            Roku (ROKU),      the other leading streaming play, is down 28%. On Monday, it fell 5.7% to $96.26, closing below $100 a share for the first time since September. Write to Eric J.

1,"It may sound like an episode of the Odd Couple, but            Honeywell International      —and its thousands of buttoned up engineers—signed a deal Tuesday with            JPMorgan Chase      —and its legion of suspendered bankers—for use of Honeywell’s quantum computer. “Honeywell’s unique quantum computer, along with the ecosystem Honeywell has developed around it, will enable us to get closer to tackling major and growing business challenges in the financial services industry,” Marco Pistoia, managing director at JPMorgan Chase (ticker: JPM), said in a news release issued by Honeywell (HON). “Quantum computing” and generic “business challenges” sound a little impenetrable to the layman. But            International Business Machines      (IBM) says quantum computers, with their vastly higher computational speed, can help banks with risk modeling, customer verification and economic scenario planning. Honeywell, for its part has ambitions beyond just quantum for banks. “Materials companies will explore new molecular structures. Transportation companies will optimize logistics. Financial institutions will need faster and more precise software applications. Pharmaceutical companies will accelerate the discovery of new drugs,” Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk said in the news release. “We are striving to influence how quantum computing evolves and to create opportunities for our customers to benefit from this powerful new technology.”Honeywell also announced that it has the world’s fastest quantum computer, with a quantum volume of “at least 64, twice that of the next alternative in the industry. IBM looks to be the second fastest with a quantum volume of 32. Quantum volume refers to the complexity of the problem that can be solved with a quantum computer. That helps only a little, but it is all Barron’s can offer. Quantum computing is mind-blowing, often involving ultralow temperatures and ambiguous states of being. “Our quantum computing starts with having a MEMS layer that acts to trap individual ytterbium atoms. We take atoms and hit them with a laser, which strips an electron and traps an ion in an electric field,” Tony Uttley, president of Honeywell quantum solutions, said in an earlier interview. “We create these wells underneath the ion—the ion is a q-bit—the cool thing about quantum mechanics is a q-bit can be a one or a zero at the same time.” Quantum computing is confusing. But the news is one sign that quantum computing at Honeywell, IBM and other industry players is almost ready for prime time—that is, meaningful commercial applications. Honeywell said it has more 100 scientists working on quantum computing. Honeywell stock was up 0.5% in premarket trading Tuesday.        Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures were up 0.5% and        S&P 500      futures were 0.4% higher.

0,"Apple      played a significant role in Monday’s historic rally. Shares of the iPhone maker soared 9.3%, the stock’s largest one-day move in more than 11 years. The $24.45 per share gain contributed 172 points to the        Dow Jones Industrial Average’s      1,296 point gain. Apple (ticker: AAPL) closed the day at $298.91, after trading as high as $301.44 during the day’s session. The stock peaked at $327.20 on Feb. 12.Apple’s rally boosted the company’s market value by $111 billion—that’s just slightly shy of the current valuation of            IBM      (IBM). Apple’s market capitalization now stands at $1.3 trillion.Apple shares have been under pressure since the company’s mid-February announcement that it no longer expects to reach its previous March quarter revenue guidance of $63 billion to $67 billion, due to a combination of coronavirus-related supply chain and demand issues in China. While Apple’s warning spurred Wall Street analysts to cut their sales estimates for the March quarter—the consensus forecast has dropped to about $61 billion—many analysts think that Apple is only seeing demand delays, rather than demand destruction, with no fundamental changes to the company’s long-term outlook. As Barron’s reported, Oppenheimer raised its rating on Apple stock on Monday—after a 16.5% drop from Feb. 12 through last Friday’s close—arguing the stock had become too cheap. Write to Eric J.

The decision follows IBM’s decision to pull out of the event last week.“We learned today that AT&T Cybersecurity made the decision to no longer participate in RSA Conference 2020 as a Gold Sponsor,” RSA said in a blog post Thursday. “We understand and respect their decision.”In a statement, AT&T confirmed that it has withdrawn from the conference. “We have decided not to participate in RSA Conference 2020 after careful consideration and discussions,” the company said. “We value our participation in industry events like RSA and greatly support the measures taken by event organizers to protect attendees. But it is our responsibility to safeguard our employees. While we are withdrawing our participation for this year, we look forward to returning next year.”The RSA Conference is scheduled to open for registration on Saturday, Feb. 22. Exhibitors have begun building their booths in preparation for the event, RSA said.According to RSA, 13 exhibitors have now pulled out of the event, including six from China, six from the U.S., and one from Canada. RSA notes that three China-based companies are still planning to exhibit at the show, but with U.S.-based staff. RSA said about 1.2% of registered attendees have now canceled their registrations.In its blog post, RSA notes that there are only 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. and zero in San Francisco.Previously, concerns about the spread of coronavirus triggered the cancellation of next week’s Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, the world’s biggest smartphone conference.

0,"Apple’s      warning Monday that it will miss March-quarter guidance due to coronavirus-related supply-chain and sales issues in China raises an obvious question: What other companies are vulnerable to the same conditions?On the supply side, there are obvious implications for anyone that sources hardware from China-based contract manufacturers, which includes most companies that make personal computers, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronics goods. It also affects any company that typically sources, manufactures, and distributes parts made in China—and there will be second-order effects for companies that make parts in other places, as the entire supply chain slows. (If Apple can’t make iPhones, then all of their suppliers suffer the consequences.)On the demand side, the primary effect is the one Apple (ticker: AAPL) cited—China retail sales are at a standstill. But there could also be secondary effects as a shortage of products hits retail shelves in other markets.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi points out in a research note Tuesday that among the U.S. hardware companies he follows, the most exposed are PC makers            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ). He estimates that Dell has 20%-35% exposure to the China market on the supply side, with high-single-digit revenue exposure. The vulnerability is higher at HP, which sources more than half of its hardware, and generates about 10% of revenue, in China.Exposure is more limited for server manufacturers. Sacconaghi estimates            Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s      (HPE) China exposure at 3%-5% on the revenue side and 5%-10% on the manufacturing side. He puts            IBM’s      (IBM) exposure at under 5% for both revenue and manufacturing. More exposed is            Tesla      (TSLA), with an estimated 20% exposure to both the supply and demand sides of the market.In a research note this morning, Citi analyst Jim Suva provides a lengthy list of companies ranked by China revenue exposure, including glassmaker            Corning      (GLW), which gets about a quarter of its revenues from China and operates a glassmaking facility in Wuhan. There are implications here for the electronics distributors            Arrow Electronics      (ARW), at 20% revenue exposure, and            Avnet      (AVT), at 15%.  Barron’s reached out to a number of companies with potential China exposure for comments. The bottom line is that none are quite ready to quantify the impact on financial results, but neither are they ignoring the issue.Shares of Apple, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Avnet, Arrow, and Dell all closed modestly lower on Tuesday.

1,"Coronavirus fears can’t keep stock markets down. Overseas shares—and U.S. stock futures—are rising despite about 3,100 more cases reported in China. About 41,000 coronavirus cases have been reported world-wide since late January. Hong Kong’s        Hang Seng Index      is up 1.3% in overseas trading. Europe’s        FTSE 100 Index      is up 0.9%. Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures are up 0.3%.        S&P 500      futures are 0.2% higher. Nasdaq Composite futures have risen 0.4%. The telecom sector is the big premarket mover Tuesday.            Sprint      (ticker: S) looks to be the stock of the day. Shares are up almost 65% in premarket trading. The telecom company stock rose on reports its merger with            T-Mobile US      (TMUS) will be approved by antitrust regulators. T-Mobile is up 7.8% to $91.12.That’s given a boost to            Deutsche Telekom      (DTE.Germany) shares, which are up 4.1% in overseas trading, and            SoftBank      (9984.Japan) stock, which has risen 1.5%. Deutsche owns T-Mobile shares and SoftBank owns Sprint stock. The merger news has even been good for T-Mobile competitors            AT&T      (T) and            Verizon      (VZ), which are up 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Investors often believe a more consolidated industry leads to more rational pricing. That’s good for everyone, as the saying goes: A rising tide lifts all boats. Elsewhere,             Slack Technologies      (WORK) stock is down 7% in premarket trading after rising more than 15% Monday. The stock spiked after reports surfaced that Slack’s work collaboration software was to be adopted at            International Business Machines      (IBM). It was a strange move and Slack put out a news release later in the day pointing out IBM was already a large customer. Finally, stock in oil services giant            Schlumberger      (SLB) is down about 0.3% in premarket trading. Oil prices are the problem for the entire energy sector. Brent crude futures for April delivery lost $1.20 per barrel, or 2.2% to $53.27, Monday. Month-to-date April Brent futures are down 8.4%. Year-to-date, they are down $12.73 or 19.3%.

1,"Google parent            Alphabet’sfourth-quarter earnings report provided a lot more to chew on than usual, as management finally responded to investor nagging for more granular information on the company’s business lines. Actual performance was mixed, and not all of the surprises that emerged from the additional data were happy ones. Let’s sort it out. Here are 10 key takeaways from the Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) earnings report. 1. Financial performance was light.  Revenues were about 2% below consensus, and operating income missed by 6%, but earnings per share beat easily, reflecting a lower-than-expected tax rate, weakness in the company’s hardware business, and regulatory settlements. “We found there was little to cheer about in terms of the company’s financial performance relative to Street expectations,” Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White writes in a research note. “However, we believe the market has been trained not to give too much credence to one quarter’s performance given the temperamental nature of the company’s results. Recall,            Facebook      FB failed to excite investors with its fourth quarter earnings results last week, thus digital ad spending in the December quarter appears to have been a bit softer than the market expected.” 2. Everyone likes the additional transparency.  When Alphabet recently named Sundar Pichai as CEO to go along with his previous role as CEO of Google, there was considerable investor chatter about the possibility that he would be a more shareholder-friendly leader than co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The stock might be down, but Pichai scored some long-lasting points with the additional data. 3. YouTube’s business is almost as big as            Netflix.      Some thought it was bigger.  YouTube had fourth-quarter ad revenue of $4.7 billion, up 31% year over year. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak says YouTube’s 2019 ad revenue of $15 billion is about $6 billion smaller than he had expected, but growing faster than he had modeled. Alphabet said it has 20 million subscribers to YouTube music services, generating about $3 billion in annual revenue, and 2 million subscribers for YouTube TV, the company’s streaming-cable replacement service. YouTube’s business at $15 billion is almost the same size as Netflix (NFLX), which had 2019 revenue of $15.8 billion. 4. The search business is bigger than some had expected.  Nowak says 2019 search revenues at $98.1 billion was actually about 6% larger than he had expected. He notes that search is the company’s “highest incremental margin business,” which means “even larger underlying free cash flow.” 5. Google’s got a big and growing cloud business, but lags behind the leaders. Google’s cloud segment had $2.6 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 53% year over year. That includes both G Suite, the company’s office applications business, as well as Google Cloud Platform, the public cloud service that competes with            Microsoft’s      (MSFT) Azure and            Amazon.com’s      (AMZN) Amazon Web Services. The company said GCP is growing substantially faster than the overall cloud business, but it didn’t give more specific data. The overall cloud business has about a $10 billion annual run rate. Amazon Web Services had revenue of just under $10 billion for the fourth quarter alone, growing 34%. Microsoft Azure grew 62% in the December quarter, but the company doesn’t break out its revenue; it does say that “commercial cloud” revenue was $12.5 billion, up 39%.            IBM      (IBM) had “total cloud revenue” of $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 21%. 6. Alphabet is still buying back stock, but there is room for a more aggressive approach on returning cash to shareholders.  The company repurchased $6.1 billion worth of shares in the fourth quarter, leaving $21 billion remaining on the current buyback authorization. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said Alphabet will keep buying back stock at the same rate or faster going forward. But the company keeps piling up cash—it now has about $120 billion in cash and equivalents, and could easily get more aggressive on repurchases or start paying a dividend. 7. The company’s staff is expanding rapidly.  Alphabet said head count at year end was 118,899, up 20.4%. Porat said in the earnings call that head-count growth in 2020 would accelerate slightly from 2019, due to the impact of investment, the pending acquisition of            Fitbit      (FIT), and a decision to move “certain vendor functions” in house. 8. The company hinted at a more rigorous approach to its money-losing “other bets.”  While Pichai and Porat didn’t quite lay out a plan, they did suggest that some of the businesses in that group, such as Waymo, Verily, and Calico, are getting big enough to begin separating from the mother ship. In the quarter, the company lost more than $2 billion on the “other bets,” and the Street would like to see a more shareholder-friendly approach to those long-term investments emerge over time. 9. Despite the apparent revenue and operating-income miss, many analysts today upped their price targets on the stock.  We counted at least nine target increases. 10. Its market cap is back under a trillion.  Alphabet shares are down about 3.4% in recent trading, at $1,431.55, dropping the company’s valuation back under the $1 trillion level. The        S&P 500      is up 1.6%. Write to Eric J.

0,"The enterprise-software sector isn’t going to be a haven from the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at both            Citigroup      and Jefferies weighed in on the group Wednesday morning, and both made wholesale estimate cuts for the enterprise-software companies they cover. These companies aren’t directly subject to supply-chain issues or reduced consumer demand, but they have an assortment of vulnerabilities nonetheless as the coronavirus dampens economic activity worldwide.Citi’s Walter Pritchard asserts that “the global reaction to the outbreak will cause some short-term impact on the ability of software companies to close business.” He notes that a number of companies report earnings this week—including            Adobe      (ticker: ADBE),            Oracle      (ORCL),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and            DocuSign      (DOCU)—which will provide a fresh look at the impact of the virus on software demand. He’s keeping a close eye on Adobe and Oracle, both of which report February quarters and which have “meaningful Japan exposure.”Pritchard sees the companies affected by both soft demand in Asia and risk to high-touch sales models as travel is curtailed and trade shows and meetings are canceled. He also expects a hit to more transactional revenue, like advertising. Companies more tied to recurring revenue, where selling is less required, will be less vulnerable, he says. Pritchard cut estimates for many, but not all, of the companies he covers, noting that the most significant cuts affect            Ceridian HCM      Holding (CDAY),            Check Point Software Technologies      (CHKP),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD),            Dynatrace      (DT),            Guidewire Software      (GWRE), MicroStrategy (MSTR),            Open Text      (OTEX),            PTC      (PTC),            Splunk      (SPLK),            SAP      (SAP), and            Zscaler      (ZS).In a similar vein, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill cut estimates for 40 companies in his coverage universe for their current fiscal years by 1%-3%. Thill notes that over the past few weeks, a number of companies have already made cautious comments on the outlook.Microsoft      (MSFT), for instance, warned that it won’t reach its previous target in its “More Personal Computing” segment, which includes Windows.            VMware      (VMW) cited virus-related impact on Asian demand, and            Zendesk      (ZEN) pointed to virus risk at a recent analyst day. And Thill notes that March quarter guidance from companies on a normal calendar reporting scheduled likely provided their outlook before the global outbreak, and could be at risk.Thill says companies with exposure to perpetual licenses and multiyear on-premise licenses are most at risk, as travel restrictions reduce the mobility and impact of software sales and support staff. He cites            Check Point,Commvault      (CVLT), Oracle,            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW),            SailPoint      (SAIL),            Tufin Software Technologies      (TUFN), and VMware as companies with high license-revenue exposure. He sees more limited impact for companies with lower touch sales and implementation models. In that group, he includes            Atlassian      (TEAM),            Bill.com      (BILL),            Cloudflare      (NET),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            HubSpot      (HUBS),            Dropbox      (DBX), and Zendesk. Thill says            Intuit      (INTU) is “one of our most defensive names, with subscription-based small business accounting and predictable tax business.” He also likes            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), since “worker mobility is a potential long-term driver of incremental licenses and could benefit from increased remote working near-term.”The Jefferies analyst adds that he would be wary of companies with elevated revenue multiples, which he argues could be more vulnerable to sharp declines. Companies he covers trading at more than 15 times the next 12 months’ revenue include            Bill.com      (BILL),            Shopify      (SHOP),            Datadog      (DDOG),            RingCentral      (RNG),            Paycom Software      (PAYC), Atlassian, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and            Smartsheet      (SMAR).Thill suggests software investors focus on companies with strong fundamental stories and high profitability, calling out Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit,            ServiceNow      (NOW), and Ring Central.Amid a sharp, broad market decline Wednesday, almost all software stocks are trading lower.

1,"Just weeks after agreeing to acquire Credit Karma for $7 billion,            Intuit      is considering buying another fintech firm, two people familiar with the matter said. Intuit (ticker: INTU) is “looking hard” at Finicity, which is up for sale, these people said. Other possible targets include Credit Sesame and NerdWallet. Finicity is expected to sell for $1 billion to $2 billion, while Credit Sesame could go for $500 million to $750 million. It’s unclear what NerdWallet might fetch. Intuit, the tax-software company known for QuickBooks and TurboTax, confirmed Feb. 24 that it was acquiring Credit Karma for $7.1 billion. The merger combines two companies that aim to solve the personal finance problems of consumers, a statement said. “We do not comment on speculations or rumors,” an Intuit spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions. Coronavirus-related volatility continued to weigh on the broad market Monday; Intuit’s shares dropped 4.3%, or $11.45, to $263.73 in morning trading. Market volatility has slowed down many transactions, with some expecting a drop in M&A valuations. This could mean a buying opportunity. “There is a lot of money on the sidelines and I would expect companies to take advantage,” a banker said. Finicity is a data aggregator; its Application Programming Interface, better known as API, is a software intermediary that lets two applications talk to each other. The Murray, Utah-based firm provides a suite of APIs that helps companies like            Experian      or Ellie Mae to authenticate and enroll customers. Finicity has raised some $80 million in funding, Crunchbase said. Investors include Experian Ventures, PitchBook said. The company is similar to Plaid, which            Visa      agreed to buy in January for $5.3 billion. Plaid’s APIs help users connect their bank accounts to finance apps and transfer money. The deal has led many to wonder which fintech would get sold next. Credit Sesame, which had been expected to go public later this year or in 2021, is a smaller version of Credit Karma. Launched in 2010, the Mountain View, Calif., company has been profitable since 2017, the company said. Like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame offers consumers unlimited free access to credit scores, as well as identity theft protection and savings recommendations. Credit Sesame has raised $120.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. That includes a $43 million round in August. Investors include Menlo Ventures, Inventus Capital, Globespan Capital, IA Capital Groups,            Symantec,      Capital One Ventures, and Stanford University.Some, however, doubted Credit Karma’s interest. “Credit Sesame is just like Credit Karma,” one private equity executive said. “Why would they want two?”Founded in 2009, NerdWallet aims to help users make better personal financial decisions. This includes picking a credit card, a personal loan or a mortgage. The San Francisco company has raised $105 million in funding through four rounds, Crunchbase said. Investors include IVP, Core Innovation Capital and Camelot Financial Capital Management. “It’s our company policy not to comment on speculation or rumors related to our business, our solutions or our markets,” Andy Capener, a Finicity spokesman, said in an emailed response to questions. Credit Sesame and NerdWallet could not be reached for comment.

1,"When Bill Nolin was in elementary school, his father quit his job to start a steel-fabrication business. “This business was in our lives daily, whether it was my mom running the accounts, or my dad coming home at 5:30 p.m. with the pickup truck loaded with boxes to ship or me helping him put on the labels that my mom had prepared and going to the UPS store,” says the manager of the        Principal Blue Chip      fund. The business wasn’t just a job to his parents. “It was something they loved; a passion or calling,” he says. “And they worked on it 24-7.” Nolin, 51, seeks that kind of “owner-operator” passion from the executives of the companies in his fund (ticker: PBLAX). He invests in businesses still run by their founders, or at least where executives behave like founders—those who think long-term and have significant insider ownership. “Most of corporate America is not run that way,” he says. “Especially, mid-cap and large-cap companies are run by what we call cash-paid-for CEOs: people who don’t have a large ownership stake and are mostly paid employees. At such companies there is a strong pressure from Wall Street to get results immediately.” Such short-termism leads to executive decisions “that aren’t good for the business, but good for the CEO” who is seeking a quarterly bonus.But Nolin’s results are unquestionable. Blue Chip’s 14.8% five-year annualized return beats 94% of its peers in Morningstar’s Large Growth category, as well as the 13.3% return of its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index. And it has done this with less volatility than both. Nolin also runs the older        Principal MidCap      (PEMGX), now closed to new investors, which has trounced 97% of its peers in the past decade. (Although Blue Chip carries a 5.50% load, large brokers such as Fidelity and TD Ameritrade often waive that commission.)Nolin is chief investment officer of an 11-member boutique subsidiary of Principal called Aligned Investors, which manages around $32 billion, including Blue Chip’s $5.3 billion. He and co-manager Tom Rozycki, 40, are supported by six investment analysts devoted exclusively to the Aligned subsidiary. Blue Chip was launched in 2012 as an offshoot of the boutique’s mid-cap fund. “What we noticed over time was our successful mid-cap companies eventually became too large to own in our mid-cap strategy,” Nolin says. “It made sense to start a strategy where we could invest in these larger companies.” Some of the “graduates” from the mid-cap fund to Blue Chip have included supermarket company            Costco Wholesale      (COST), fast food restaurateur            Yum! Brands      (YUM), and cellphone-tower giant            American Tower      (AMT), Nolin says.One graduate, which MidCap sold after 16 years but Blue Chip purchased last November, is tax-software company            Intuit      (INTU), which sells TurboTax and QuickBooks. “QuickBooks and TurboTax are both so dominant,” Nolin says. “People are trained in the software and don’t want to switch.” The rise of the so-called gig economy is increasing the number of self-employed Uber drivers, etc., who need QuickBooks to itemize their mileage and depreciation expenses, he adds. “There’s a long runway for QuickBooks,” he says, noting that there are 48 million small businesses and self-employed Americans, and only a 7% penetration of that market for the online software. Meanwhile, Intuit has begun providing live video-chat advice from its accountants to take market share from            H&R Block      (HRB) for those who need more hands-on service.Nolin attributes much of Intuit’s success to its dynamic founder Scott Cook, who remains chairman of its executive committee. “He still works with the people at Intuit because he’s a fanatic about making it easier for people to use their products,” Nolin says. “That’s how you end up being 15 times larger than your nearest competitor.” One metric Nolin employs to analyze whether a company’s executives are truly owner-operators is an “aligned ratio,” comparing their stock ownership to their annual salary and other benefits. “At the typical public company, the ratio is in the range of three to six times, so maybe a CEO owns $6 million worth of stock and gets paid $2 million a year—three times,” says Nolin. “A lot of our companies, the ratio is 20 to 1, and we have several that are 50 or 100 to 1, and some that are 2,000 to 1.”Then there’s            Amazon.      com (AMZN), the fund’s largest holding at 8.5% of its portfolio as of the end of 2019. According to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has an almost 56-million-share stake—worth $105 billion at a recent $1,884 share price. His 2019 base salary, without any bonus, was $81,840, and his total compensation was $1.7 million—a 62,226-to-1 ratio. But a high ratio isn’t enough. Aside from Amazon’s retail and cloud-computing dominance, co-manager Rozycki says the company’s more recent forays into internet advertising are being undervalued by the market. “Amazon has this built-out advantage in its retail business and now the ability to layer on something that produces royalties on top of that retail business in the form of advertising,” Rozycki says. “That’s extremely profitable.” He likes royalty structures that allow companies to collect fees with little additional operating costs. For instance,            Hilton Worldwide      Holdings (HLT), another fund holding, charges 5% fees to hotel franchisees using the Hilton name.Nolin doesn’t just expect insider ownership from his investments’ CEOs; he practices what he preaches. In the latest addendum to Blue Chip’s prospectus, you’ll find he and Rozycki each have over $1 million invested in the fund, the highest investment amount disclosable by SEC rules. “I personally don’t want to say how much over a million, but it’s much, much more than a million,” Nolin says. “In addition to owning it personally, I own it through my 401(k) and a co-investment vehicle here at work. Tom does the same.” As do all of the fund’s analysts. That way, the team at Aligned Investors not only seeks owner-operators, they think like owners, too.

0,"Enterprise software stocks took a beating last week as the sky-high multiples on the group continued to contract. As Barron’s noted on Friday, many names dropped by more than 10% with minimal provocation. On Monday morning, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill weighed in on last week’s selloff, and he cautions that the selloff likely isn’t done just yet.“High growth software valuations are now trading above terminal M&A multiples, suggesting we still have more room for multiple contraction,” Thill wrote in a research note. “We expect that the short-term correction will continue given multiples remain elevated even with last week’s correction.” See also: Sky-High Software Stocks Are Beginning to Look Like They’re Forming a Bubble“Historically, software companies have traded within a band from 2x to 12x (enterprise value to next 12 month revenues,)” he wrote. “While the lower end of that band has remained the same, the higher end of the band has been pushed to 20x+...For instance, COUP (            Coupa Software      ) trades at 20x 2020E EV/Revenue and ZM (Zoom Video) trades at 22x 2020E EV/revenue. Even historic terminal M&A takeout multiples do not support these valuations...As such, we believe current valuation multiples for the high growth names are unsustainable and we expect that the correction will continue.”Thill suggests that investors stick to “platform names with attractive growth and reasonable valuations” like            Microsoft      (MSFT),            Salesforce.com      (CRM), and            Intuit      (INTU). He also likes Sailpoint (SAIL),            Zuora      (ZUO), and            Varonis Systems      (VRNS) “that have the potential for revenue reacceleration over the next year.”Thill writes that his “most interesting takeaway from last week is no one is immune from multiple contraction—TEAM (            Atlassian      ) beat and raised but saw shares down 9% last week. Workday at its analyst earlier this week cited ‘some delays’ in deals and its shares were down ~16%. We expect to see this valuation pressure on other high growth names as we head into earnings season.” Write to Eric J.

1,"It’s time for software investors to get picky. That’s the advice from Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who picked up the firm’s coverage of the software sector late Monday with a flurry of rating and price target changes “to be more defensive in light of valuation and macroeconomic concerns.” Thill writes in a research note that he remains positive on the software industry over all, but adds that he advises “a more selective approach to stocks given rich valuations.”Thill raised the firm’s rating on            Microsoft      (MSFT) shares to Buy from Hold — his only upgrade — with a new target of $160, up from $93. But he goes to Hold from Buy on            Oracle      (ORCL), with a new target of $60, down from $66. Also downgraded to Hold from Buy were          Carbonite      (CARB), with a new target of $17, from $29, and            Check Point Software Technologies       (CHKP), target reduced to $115, from $140. Thill trimmed price targets on            Citrix Systems      (CTXS),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD), Dynatrace (DT),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            VMware      (VMW), and            Workday (WDAY).He adds that the high multiples associated with recent IPOs like Zoom Video Communications (ZM),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and CrowdStrike “are unsustainable.”“Given the recent macroeconomic backdrop, we favor large-cap names within our coverage universe Microsoft,            Salesforce      (CRM),            Adobe      (ADBE) and            Intuit      (INTU) with a balance of good growth and multiple support,” he writes. “We favor applications as they cannot be ‘Amazoned’ out, and we would be more selective on the infrastructure side. We would play defense on the highfliers in the short term.”As for Microsoft, Thill writes that he sees “a large diversified business with excellent visibility that has a clear line of sight into double-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future.” He sees multiple growth drivers in Azure, Office, and LinkedIn, and says the company is “levered to favorable secular trends,” ensuing profitability and free cash flow from strong growth. He also notes that Microsoft has been steadily returning capital to shareholders—the company has bought back $72.5 billion of stock since June 2014. And he points out that Microsoft shares have outperformed both Oracle and the IGV software stock index year-to-date—and over the last one, three, five, and 10 years. On Oracle, Thill notes simply that he prefers Microsoft given its faster growth rate. He adds that Oracle is losing ground in the infrastructure business as workloads migrate to the cloud. “Despite its dominance in high-end, on-premise relational database workloads, Oracle has been a laggard in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, which has weighed on growth as workloads migrate to the cloud,” he writes. Thill notes that Oracle’s revenues have about flat recently, while Microsoft continues to show growth in the low-double digits. Write to Eric J.

1,"A top-performing hedge-fund manager argues that growth stocks remain the best place for investors despite the recent pullback in the sector amid a revival in value-oriented issues.“Investors should own a concentrated portfolio of high-quality businesses that can deliver strong organic growth even if the economy falters,” says Dev Kantesaria, portfolio manager and founder of Valley Forge Capital Management, which has about $500 million in assets under management. Kantesaria’s hedge fund, Valley Forge Capital, was up 44.4% year-to-date through the end of August, according to BarclayHedge/Prequin.The 12-year-old Valley Forge owns a concentrated portfolio of growth stocks that include            Fair Isaac      (ticker: FICO),            Moody’s      (MCO),            Visa      (V), and            Intuit      (INTU). These are all up strongly this year, but have fallen lately as growth and momentum stocks retreat. The firm is based outside Philadelphia. Kantesaria’s view is that U.S. interest rates will remain low for an extended period of time and that growth stocks are the best place to be. “U.S. equities offer the best risk/reward opportunity among all asset classes globally,” he says. He adds that stocks with price/earnings ratios of 25 – and earnings yields of 4% -- stack up well against the 10-year Treasury note, which yields just 1.73%. “You cannot keep up with inflation if you buy the 10-year Treasury,” he says. Inflation is running between 1.5% and 2% and taxable investors in higher tax brackets have to pay about a third of their Treasury income in federal taxes. Kantesaria says the companies in the Valley Forge portfolio tend to have wide moats around their business. Visa and rival            Mastercard      (MA) dominate the payments industry. Moody’s and            S&P Global      (SPGI) are leaders in the credit-rating business, while Fair Isaac is famous for its FICO credit scores and Intuit has transformed its TurboTax income-tax guides into a lucrative subscription-software business. None of these stocks is cheap, however. Visa has a price/earnings ratio of 33 based on projected current-year earnings; Fair Isaac, 45; Moody’s, 26; and Intuit, 35. “Valuations are appropriate given the quality of their businesses,” he says. Kantesaria doesn’t own FAANG stocks such as            Alphabet      (GOOGL) and            Facebook      (FB), but he does own some            Amazon.com      (AMZN) stock. He isn’t thrilled with the capital-allocation policies of FAANG stocks, noting heavy capital expenditures at Alphabet. Facebook, Amazon, and Alphabet don’t pay dividends. Amazon doesn’t repurchase stock. Facebook buybacks are running at an annual rate of less than 1% of its market value and Alphabet buys back about 1.5% of its shares a yearly, barely exceeding its stock-based compensation.“Companies that can deliver predictable and growing earnings will be prized assets,” he says. Corrections & Amplifications  Dev Kantesaria, portfolio manager and founder of Valley Forge Capital Management, holds a small amount of Amazon.com stock.

Delta Air Lines      and            UnitedHealth      can’t stop talking about it.Much of Corporate America is obsessed with its net promoter score, or NPS, The Wall Street Journal reports. It’s a measure of customer satisfaction that has developed a cult-like following among CEOs in recent years. Unlike profits or sales, which are measured and audited, NPS is usually calculated from a one-question survey that companies often administer themselves.Last year, “net promoter” or “NPS” was cited more than 150 times in earnings conference calls by 50        S&P 500      companies, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of transcripts. That’s more than four times as many mentions, and nearly three times as many companies, compared with five years earlier.Executives pointed to strong or rising NPS as proof that shoppers preferred to pick up orders at Target stores or that Google’s newest Pixel smartphone was off to a good start. Out of all the mentions the Journal tracked on earnings calls, no executive has ever said the score declined.Dozens of public companies are reporting the score in securities filings. Last year, “net promoter” was mentioned in 56 proxy filings. Some companies, including American Express, Best Buy and Citigroup, list the metric as a criteria for executive compensation, alongside traditional measures such as revenue growth and earnings per share. Read our recent cover story: 7 Dividend Stocks for Volatile Times AheadThe score was introduced in 2003 in a Harvard Business Review article titled “The One Number You Need to Grow.” The Bain & Co. consultant who wrote the article called NPS the “simplest, most intuitive and best predictor of customer behavior” and a “useful predictor of growth.”Since then, the metric has taken on a life of its own, so much so that the inventor, Fred Reichheld, said he is astonished that companies are using NPS to determine bonuses and as a performance indicator. “That’s completely bogus,” Mr. Reichheld, who still consults for Bain, said in an interview. “I had no idea how people would mess with the score to bend it, to make it serve their selfish objectives.”  Read the full version of this article at The Wall Street Journal.

1,"Most money managers, even those who consider themselves hands-on, “kick the tires” types, usually start with a computerized quantitative screen of their entire stock universe to narrow down potential investment candidates. Not Bryan Hinmon. “If we started from a quantitative place, we’d end up in the same place as everyone else,” the manager of the MFAM Global Opportunities fund says. “We’re interested in running portfolios that have a chance of outperformance.” Hinmon’s logic makes sense: If you want to beat the market and competitors, you have to discover the unique qualitative advantages in companies that a quant screen or a factor-based fund can’t detect.        MFAM Global Opportunities      (ticker: FOOLX) has benefited by this approach. Over the past five years, its 8.6% annualized return has beaten 88% of its peers in Morningstar’s World Large Stock fund category; over the past decade, 92%.But how do you find companies in a universe of thousands of stocks, without using screens? Hinmon’s solution is his diverse staff—six analysts and co-manager Anthony Arsta, who don’t all come from the financial world. “My team has educational backgrounds in pharmacology, mechanical engineering, education, law, banking, computer science, and then finance,” he says. “The intersection and interaction of those backgrounds really lead us to a place where we achieve unique insights.” Hinmon employs a concentrated strategy; the $487 million fund owns 40 to 50 stocks and holds them for several years. The eight team members are required to generate eight new ideas a year. That enables them to dig deeply into their research.Hinmon, who is also chief investment officer of Motley Fool Asset Management, or MFAM, has a more conventional résumé. He began his career in 2003 as an analyst for three separate money-management businesses run out of the same office in Naples, Fla. One was a wealth management firm where some client portfolios had holdings for 20 or 25 years; another was a private-equity firm that often invested in small businesses. This taught Hinmon that “the numbers don’t always tell you everything. You’re making bets on people and on strategy.” He ran a hedge fund during the financial crisis, from 2007 until 2010, where he learned the distinction between poorly run companies and those with “management teams that think and act for the long term even when there’s chaos surrounding them.” Hinmon joined Motley Food Asset Management in 2010, just after the financial website launched its asset management arm. Global Opportunities was its first fund, launched in June 2009; Hinmon joined the fund’s management team in 2015. MFAM now oversees $1 billion million in two mutual funds and two exchange-traded funds.Hinmon looks for strong companies that can withstand the next crisis. “We define quality across four pillars, the first being management, corporate culture, and incentives,” he says. The other three pillars are a business’ economics, competitive advantage, and trajectory: “Will this be a better or worse business in 10 years, and why?” Before any company can enter the portfolio, its analyst must write a report scoring the company on each of the four pillars from one to five. Everyone else comes up with their own quality scores for the stock. The team then debates whether the company should be added to the portfolio; Hinmon and Arsta make the final call. Note: Holdings as of 6/30; Returns as of 8/26; three- and five-year returns are annualized. Sources: Morningstar; Motley Fool Asset ManagementHinmon’s most recent addition, in April, is laser manufacturer            nLIGHT      (LASR), which one of his analysts has been following for 10 years. The company manufactures everything that goes into its high-powered lasers and has only one competitor,            IPG Photonics      —which the fund also owns. IPG (IPGP) and            nLIGHT      have managed to reduce the costs of owning, operating, and maintaining their lasers, which are far more precise than low-end lasers. Adoption of their lasers by industrial manufacturers has been rapid. nLIGHT checks off all of the fund’s boxes for quality. Its long-term trajectory is perhaps its strongest feature. It’s a small company with a market value of $480 million, but Hinmon’s team expects its fiber-optic lasers to permanently take market share from traditional carbon-dioxide ones. Hinmon says its gross profit margins can expand from 35% to 50%. And the company is still run by its three founders, all with engineering backgrounds. The stock has fallen sharply during the U.S. trade war, as one of its end markets is China, but Hinmon sees that as a buying opportunity.  Hinmon is a thematic investor, looking for long-term industry trends and then investigating every company in a favorite industry. He likes online retail, so the obvious choice, Amazon.com (AMZN), is the fund’s biggest holding. He says it has plenty of room to grow, despite its immense size. But he also owns Argentina’s MercadoLibre (MELI), which is “viewed as the Amazon of Latin America,” he says. “That sells the company short because it not only has a thriving e-commerce business, but like            PayPal      (PYPL) it also has invested quite a bit in electronic payments. And Latin America is a market that it has already successfully defended against Amazon.”One important theme for Hinmon is the evolution of workplaces, so that intangible assets such as human or intellectual capital—meaning people—have become more valuable than physical assets such as real estate. He’s a big fan of software companies, which make up 14% of the fund’s portfolio, especially ones that facilitate a digital workplace. One favorite is            Atlassian      (TEAM). The Australian company originally designed its Jira software to allow software engineers to collaborate in code development, but has since expanded to manage workflow for all departments within an organization. Bringing disparate people together to collaborate is certainly something that Hinmon knows all about.

0," Losing Faith. All three main U.S. stock indexes lost ground on Monday as investors worried that the Fed might not cut interest rates at its July meeting, after a strong jobs report last week. Deutsche Bank stock slid more than 6% after announcing the a 20% workforce reduction. The Turkish lira dropped sharply against the dollar after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the country’s central bank governor on Sunday without explanation. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Time to Avoid Stocks? Stocks ended in the red Monday as Friday’s better-than-expected jobs report continued to make investors worry if a Fed rate cut in July is still on the table. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      dropped 115.98 points, or 0.43%, to close at 26806.14. The        S&P 500      lost 14.46 points, or 0.48%, to end at 2975.95, and the        Nasdaq Composite      has fallen 63.41 points, or 0.78%, to close at 8098.38.Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to give his semiannual monetary policy testimony on Wednesday and Thursday, when minutes from June’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting will also be released. As of July 2, 88 S&P 500 companies have guided second-quarter earnings per share lower than a year ago, while 26 expect EPS will rise, according to FactSet data. Wall Street strategists are expecting a 2.6% decline in S&P 500 earnings for the second quarter as compared with last year, adjusted lower from the 0.5% decline estimated at the end of March.The stronger U.S. dollar, falling crude prices, as well as company-specific issues such as troubles surrounding Boeing’s 737 MAX jets and the Department of Justice’s antitrust investigations in            Apple      (AAPL),            Facebook      (FB), and            Alphabet      (GOOGL) have all contributed to headwinds for second-quarter earnings, wrote Jonathan Golub at Credit Suisse. Still, analysts in aggregate predict the S&P 500 will see an 8.3% increase in price over the next 12 months.Adding to the deteriorating sentiment on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets cut the firm’s allocation on global equities to Underweight from Equal-Weight in a note to clients on Sunday, citing that there is only 1% average upside to the bank’s 12-month price targets—which includes dividends and is equally weighted—for the S&P 500, MSCI Europe, MSCI Emerging Markets, and Japan’s Topix. “There comes a point for every analyst where you need to change your forecast or change your view,” he wrote. “We’re doing the latter.”Global purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) continue to deteriorate, earnings estimates are too high, and Morgan Stanley’s Business Conditions Index—which surveys how equity analysts feel about their companies—suffered its largest monthly decline ever in June, wrote Sheets. The recent pause in U.S.-China trade tensions and the expected Fed rate cuts later this year are positive, but the benefits could be offset by weaker growth.Both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude futures were up more than 1% during Monday trading before slipping later in the day. That’s expected, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Singer, since the latest decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to extend production cuts is unlikely to eliminate the supply glut due to the continued growth in U.S. oil production.The bigger concern now is demand. The growth rates for both U.S. and Chinese oil demand are projected to hit multiyear lows in 2019, and it is “incrementally harder to rebalance a market driven by demand weakness,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Tran. Goldman’s Singer expects WTI oil to trade at around $50 to $60 per barrel in 2020, and Brent to trade at $55 to $65 per barrel. Still, some stocks can still do well under those conditions. Here are Singer’s pick for oil stock winners and losers.  The Hot Stock Edison International      stock (EIX) rose 3.1% to end at $69.29, breaking out to a eight-month high as the utilities sector saw moderate strengths. The Biggest Loser IPG Photonics      stock (IPGP) fell 5.2% to $141.23. The fiber-optics firm was one of a number of tech and communications stocks to fall on Monday.

1,"You can always count on earnings season to remind you that markets are unpredictable. IPG Photonics      ’ (ticker: IPGP) latest quarterly earnings report on Tuesday fell short of expectations, yet its stock jumped 10%. Markets are forward looking, so does the reaction mean optical equipment stocks have reached a bottom, or is it just an example of the randomness of markets? General Electric      (GE), and            Lennar      (LEN) stock had similar reactions, rising after disappointing earnings. But their reports didn’t offer much guidance for their respective sectors or affirm that the bottom is behind them: GE’s power unit is still shrinking and Lennar stock remains a hostage of Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. But IPG did provide some insight that indicates the stock’s post-earnings jump might have some merit. A deeper look at what the company had to say Tuesday suggests some value can be found in other optical equipment makers, too.That doesn’t mean IPG management was all that upbeat. CEO Valentin Gapontsev said, “the macroeconomic climate weakened in our largest markets, reducing demand on for laser products.” CFO Timothy Mammen added, “pricing pressures in this business are being exacerbated by softening demand trends.” So why did the stock jump? Because Mammen also said, “there has been a modest pickup in order activity since late December, and we are more encouraged by the overall demand environment than we were three months ago.” That whiff of order improvement was enough to get investors excited about the stock.And the shares are starting from a depressed point. IPG stock fell 27% on July 31 alone after order trends weakened and management cut sales guidance. IPG isn’t the only stock in its sector to feel some pain. Chinese competition and demand weakness have battered the shares of many optical equipment makers. The improvement in December orders could be the first sign of better times for IPG and its peers—in particular, other optical equipment makers such as            II-VI      (IIVI),          Finisar      (FNSR)            Lumentum      (LITE) and            Coherent      (COHR).In that group, Finisar and II-VI are combining and Lumentum recently bought Oclaro. Those deals were completed, in part, to consolidate the laser business in response to the weak operating environment. Lumentum also makes facial recognition products for the iPhone. That means its shares were also hit after            Apple      (AAPL) cut component orders for its new handsets. That has left Lumentum stock trading for just 8.5 times earnings when you account for the $6 in cash per share on its balance sheet. It is good to be early when investing in the stock market. One of the best ways to call a bottom is listening to management talk. (Of course, a single data point could be just that, too—a single, one-off occurrence and not the start of a new trend.) But at least in the case of Lumentum, the stock is still off 40% from its 52-week high, and that takes some of the risk out of the call.

1,"Shares of laser maker Coherent (COHR) are down $1.65, or 0.6%, at $257.04, despite an upbeat note today from Jagadish Iyer of Summit Redstone, who initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating today, and a $320 price target, writing that it is the “best of both worlds,” by which he means the company will ride the waves of manufacturing use of “high-power” fiber lasers, and also the organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screens for mobile devices.We believe Coherent is in a sweet spot of this ongoing industrywide transformation from LCD based displays to AMOLED displays with its Excimer laser annealing solution,” writes Iyer.Coherent’s lasers have little competition as a manufacturing tool in making OLED displays, observers Iyer: We estimate the Excimer laser tool market to grow from $570m in 2016 to over $2bn by 2020. Coherent’s ELA tools enable the active conversion of as deposited Amorphous Silicon film to Low Temperature Polysilicon (LTPS) which is a fundamental building block for OLED displays. With virtually no competition, Coherent likely grabs a large portion of this market. He notes of one competitor, MKS Instruments (MKSI) that they “have some capability” because of the company’s acquisition of Newport, though we believe it is not ready for primetime.The other side of the story is the widespread use of fiber lasers, writes Iyer: Materials processing segment which is the second biggest revenue contributor accounts for ~25% of total sales post the company’s acquisition of Rofin-Sinar. With this acquisition which closed in November’16, Coherent is now able to offer a wide variety of lasers including high power fiber lasers. Whilst Coherent’s market share is small (sub 10%) in high power fiber lasers, we believe the continued growth in automotive and industrial applications will increasingly drive material processing revenues as applications such as cutting, welding, drilling will drive greater demand for fiber laser sales. We estimate overall fiber laser market to grow from $1.6bn in 2016 to $2.6bn by 2020 (CAGR 18%)). Iyer notes that IPG Photonics (IPGP) is the incumbent in fiber lasers, but with over 70% share and Coherent’s share below 10%.But, we expect that latter share to gradually improve over the next 3 years and we remain quite optimistic that Coherent will be able to grow its fiber laser revenues by double digit through 2020.Iyer also emphasizes the vast valuation disparity between Coherent’s stock, and that of the OLED high-flyer, Universal Display (OLED): Our $320 PT is based on 21x CY18 EPS of $15.25 (cons.$13.74). Over the past three years, the stock has traded in the range of 17x to 21x forward earnings with an average multiple of 17x. The stock is currently trading at 19x CY18 consensus estimate. A peer group valuation comparison reveals Coherent is trading well below the group average of 24x forward earnings. A closer look at IPGP (Buy, $178 PT) which competes with Coherent on the Materials Processing segment reveals that its Price/Earnings multiple has expanded from mid to high teens last year to 26x forward earnings presently. Along similar lines, Universal Display (Hold, $95 PT), a pure play OLED materials supplier has had its multiple skyrocket to over 50x CY18 earnings recently on the optimism around secular growth in OLED. Given the scarcity of Coherent’s Excimer laser tools and the portfolio of laser products that the company has in its vault, we remain very optimistic on growth that is ahead for the company in both OLED and fiber lasers. We therefore believe a premium multiple of 21x P/E for Coherent is fully justified when compared to its 3-year average of 17x. As the company continues to generate sustained free cash flow over the next 2-3 years, we anticipate overall net cash position will improve considerably as deleveraging happens and this in turn should provide further support to the company’s valuation.

0," FBR & Co. To gain greater exposure to what we see as a critical growth vertical within the industrials world, we are initiating coverage of four advanced-manufacturing companies.IPG Photonics (ticker:            IPGP      ) (rated at Outperform, $120 price target), Perceptron (            PRCP      ) (rated at Outperform, $11 price target), Cognex (            CGNX      ) (rated at Market Perform, $35 price target) and Faro Technologies (            FARO      ) (rated at Market Perform, $30 price target) provide a wide array of high-tech industrial solutions (fiber lasers, metrology, vision, 3D scanners and measurement, etc.) that we believe are the critical tools necessary to meet the rapidly growing global demand for automation and supply-chain efficiencies.While many of these technologies were developed in the automotive industry over several decades, rapidly accelerating demand for manufacturing and supply-chain efficiencies (the aerospace build cycle, huge growth in e-commerce, etc.) has vastly expanded the addressable markets for these firms. Over the last 50 years, we estimate that automated technologies have penetrated approximately 10% of total manufacturing capacity but believe that now, given huge advances in network connectivity, we could be nearing an inflection point at which global penetration for these technologies could accelerate to 50% over the next 10 years. That said, we are careful to balance long-term potential with nearer-term realities (potentially slowing capital-expenditure cycles, etc.), and our recommendations herein reflect a more pragmatic approach to potential near-term headwinds, with an eye on the continued development of more long-term opportunities.IPG is our advanced-manufacturing FBR Top Pick, as we believe the company will yield equity returns in excess of 36% over the next year, given its robust growth trajectory and attractive valuation. (On a forecasted 2017 price/earnings-to-growth basis, IPG currently trades at just 1.0 times.) IPG is the world’s largest manufacturer of fiber lasers, a key disruptive technology that we expect will see 15%-plus industry growth for the next five to 10 years (more than 2.5 times expected growth for traditional lasers; around five times expected global GDP). Finally, despite a very cash-heavy balance sheet (net cash of $12 per share, 14% of equity value), IPG still boasts returns of around 20%. We believe this is a very strong midcap name that could potentially deliver outsized returns for years to come as industry adoption rates accelerate.Perceptron is a micro-cap stock (current market cap of $74 million), but it is the industry leader in advanced automotive metrology. Under a new management team, Perceptron has broadened its addressable markets by seven times in the last 18 months (going from $175 million to approximately $1 billion), and we believe this addressable market could potentially double (to $2 billion or more) over the next five years. Perceptron is taking share, and as it scales up to critical mass (we target $150 million in revenue, two times our fiscal 2015 estimates), we expect an EPS compounded annualized growth rate of at least 45%-55%.Cognex is the industry leader in machine vision—automated systems that guide, inspect, gauge and identify a myriad of parts and products in automated manufacturing and sorting processes—that are key lynchpins in systems designed to improve supply chain efficiency. In recent years, Cognex has benefited from a number of large e-commerce-related orders; as such, project-related demand has seemed to wane in 2015 (and potentially 2016), and we believe its multiple could come under pressure as growth slows relative to tough comps.Faro is an industry leader in 3D metrology, imaging and realization technology, all of which we believe offer tremendous long-term growth opportunities, but we are launching on the sidelines for two critical reasons: 1) Faro’s product suite tends to be more discretionary (versus critical) in nature, meaning its order book fell off more precipitously than its peers in the recent pause in capital-expenditure spending; and 2) on its third-quarter earnings call, Faro’s chief executive announced his pending retirement, and we cannot comfortably recommend a stock (to the long or short side) without having some sense of where the company could go under new management. -- John R.

1,"Even the most devoted Bitcoin convert will admit the network is slow.We noted in a December cover story that            Visa      (ticker: V) “can process 10,000 times as many transactions per second as Bitcoin’s vaunted blockchain.” Evercore ISI analyst David Togut offered slightly different numbers in a March 26 report. “Visa can process 65,000 transaction messages per second, at full capacity, compared with fewer than 10 bitcoin transactions per second.”In any case, you get the idea. Blockchain transaction = slow. So far that tardiness has created a moat of molasses that protects card issuers such as Visa,            Mastercard      (MA) and            American Express      (AXP) from Bitcoin encroachment. There are some ideas on how to equip cryptocurrencies with speed, however.Togut had some thoughts on two such suggestions at a March 22 panel hosted by Columbia Business School: “Blockchain: Recasting the Payment Industry’s Future.” Timothy Galebach, chief technology officer of Blockmason, suggested sharding. “Currently, every single node running the Ethereum network has to process every single transaction, which is why it’s slow,” Togut wrote. “With sharding, the network is partitioned into shards where only certain nodes process transactions for certain shards, allowing for greater speed. However, fewer nodes means reduced security, and risk of centralization; problems which have yet to be addressed.”We don’t think users would settle for less security. The other alternative was proposed by Jeff Bandman, a principal at Bandman Advisors and a former regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “Business practices could be put in place to allow for the slower verification process of blockchain, or a hybrid payments solution could be created utilizing both card and blockchain payments,” Togut noted.Perish the thoughts. Throughout advances in technology, users have never accommodated “slower” in their vocabulary. We refer readers to Emily Dickinson, who noted that only Death itself will wait patiently. A hybrid solution looks nice in theory, but it would still be slower than the card system alone.In a March 6 report, Togut wrote, “We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies pose limited disintermediation risk to our payments coverage, including Mastercard, Visa and American Express.” We agree completely.On the other hand, the Evercore analyst wrote in the earlier report that “blockchain offers long-term cost-reduction and efficiency-creation opportunities for our Bank Technology coverage, especially            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS),            Fiserv      (FISV) and            Jack Henry & Associates      (JKHY), and the market share leader in U.S. proxy services,            Broadridge Financial Solutions      (BR), in both transaction processing and trade settlement.”Togut also noted in the March 26 note that Bandman said “the underbanked” would benefit from cross-border blockchain transactions, as “too many intermediaries exist and transactions fees are high.” It’s telling that            Western Union      (WU) and            MoneyGram International      (MGI) have partnered with digital currency Ripple.Speaking of ripple, that’s all cryptocurrencies can manage to make in the card moats at this point.

0," Sterne, Agee & Leach We are reiterating our Buy ratings and raising our price targets on Fidelity National Information Services and Fiserv in light of improving end-market trends and our expectation that 2013 guidance will likely be above consensus for both companies.We are increasing our            Fidelity      (ticker: FIS) price target to $42 from $38 and our            Fiserv      (FISV) price target to $91 from $82. We are maintaining our Neutral rating on competitor            Jack Henry & Associates      (JKHY) as we expect the stock to slightly underperform versus Fiserv and Fidelity, given a slower earnings-growth outlook and less aggressive use of the balance sheet.We see improving trends in the core-processing end-market as a result of: 1) declining bank failures in the U.S.; 2) some catch-up in spending by the banks following several years of cost-containment efforts; 3) the need to aggressively build out digital channels; 4) ongoing efforts to reduce costs through outsourcing; and 5) a reduction in the distraction and uncertainty around new banking regulations. We think these trends will drive a higher level of organic-revenue growth for the industry in 2013.We view consensus expectations for Fidelity and Fiserv as beatable. Consensus earnings-per-share growth expectations for Fidelity and Fiserv are in the 10%-12% range for both 2013 and 2014, while we think growth could reach the mid teens given leverage off the uptick in organic-revenue growth, incremental cost-reduction potential, and accretive buyback potential. We think Fidelity and Fiservs 2013 guidance, which we expect to be initiated on their fourth-quarter calls next month, will be better than current expectations. Our estimates for 2013 and 2014 are above consensus.While Jack Henry posted solid fiscal-first-quarter results on improving trends for the same reasons outlined above, the stock has underperformed Fidelity and Fiserv year-to-date. Still, we think Jack Henrys EPS-growth rate could trail that of Fidelity and Fiserv (partly due to less-aggressive use of the balance sheet), and we are therefore maintaining our Neutral stance.Our new $91 price target for Fiserv is based on a price/earnings multiple of 15 times our 2013 EPS estimate of $5.84, in line with Fiservs current multiple on 2012. We believe visibility into double-digit EPS growth remains high owing to a combination of a high level of recurring revenue (about 85%), modest organic revenue (3%-5%), operating leverage, ongoing cost rationalization, and share buybacks and/or debt pay-down. Fiserv has a broad, well-diversified business providing mission-critical processing systems and services to financial institutions of all sizes. In addition, the company has been posting strong new sales, which should translate into incremental revenue as new clients are installed over the year ahead.Our new $42 price target for Fidelity is also based on a price/earnings multiple of 15 times our 2013 EPS estimate of $2.86, also in line with where shares are trading currently on our 2012 EPS estimate. We believe Fidelity has built a strong foundation that should drive consistent double-digit EPS growth through mid single-digit organic-revenue growth, operating leverage, share buybacks and/or debt pay-down. In addition, we are attracted to Fidelitys highly recurring revenue (about 80%), which should provide downside support if economic conditions weaken. Relative to close comparable Fiserv, we are attracted to Fidelitys higher mix of faster-growth international revenues as well as the fact this it is currently trading at a discount to Fiserv. -- Greg Smith  -- Jennifer Dugan To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with Soapbox Submission in the headline.

1,"Arista Networks      shares are trading modestly lower after Barclays analyst Tim Long cut his rating on the networking-hardware company to Equal Weight from Overweight, while lifting his price target on the shares to $220, from $210.The stock closed Wednesday at $235.05. Shares slipped 1.2% to $232.26 on Thursday morning Long’s primary concern is that Arista Networks (ticker: ANET) is losing market share with cloud customers, while new products in other categories are too new to offset market-share losses with key customers, in particular            Facebook      (FB) and            Microsoft      (MSFT). Long says that while the company has more than doubled its share of the data-center switch market over the last five years, “that trend is stalling.”He notes that the company’s share of the market with “cloud titan” customers reached 18% in 2018, up from 5% in 2014, but says that due to issues with Facebook and Microsoft, the total is likely to decline in 2020. He sees Facebook using more “white box” hardware—essentially building its own gear— while Microsoft adds a second source for 400-gigabit switches.Meanwhile, he says that some providers of cloud-based software are moving their services from their own data centers to the large public clouds. He also notes that in data centers and hybrid private/public cloud networks,            Juniper Networks      (JNPR) and            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) have become more competitive. Long cuts his estimates of Arista’s earnings per share to $9.16 a share from $9.50, for 2020, and to $10.06 from $10.48, for 2021. The Wall Street analyst consensus views are $9.01 and $10.29, respectively. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedThe Dogs of the Dow beat stock market averages during the decade just ended. What’s more, Barron’s found that “small dogs” offer investors superior dividend yields without sacrificing too much return. How do fast dogs—the stocks with the fastest dividend growth—perform? As it turns out, pretty well. That’s a good boy. We’re a little obsessed with dogs. There is good reason though. The Dogs of the Dow is a time-tested strategy that buys the 10 highest dividend yielding stocks in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      each year. It’s a simple, repeatable strategy and it has worked. A strategy like that is the Holy Grail for investors. The success of the Dow Dogs is also what led Barron’s to dive into other simple, repeatable—and potentially winning—investment strategies. The Small Dogs are the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Russell 2000 small capitalization index with market values over $1 billion. Small-cap stocks are typically more volatile than larger companies. We showed investors cut some of the risk of owing small stocks while receiving much higher than average dividend yields. Now for the greyhounds. The Fast Dogs strategy looks at companies growing dividend payouts at the fastest rate. The        S&P 500      was our sample set. Fast Dogs just nosed out the        S&P 500      over the past three years. Outperforming in 2017, underperforming in 2018 and, essentially, matching the market in 2019. A longer historic look would be helpful, but dividend growth data is harder to come by than just dividend yields. Barron’s suspects two fundamental reasons Fast Dogs might work over the long run. First, dividend growth demonstrates to investors the future looks bright. Higher payouts are a powerful signal to investors. What’s more, investors like dividends and more money attracts more investors. The Fast Dogs for 2020 are:            Pioneer Natural Resources      (ticker: PXD),            TechnipFMC      (FTI),            Thermo Fisher Scientific      (TMO),            Newmont      (NEM),            Cimarex Energy      (XEC),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Juniper Networks      (JNPR),            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH),            Lam Research      (LRCX) and            Progressive      (PGR). That’s a nice mix of stocks across several sectors. Deciding what stocks to buy can be hard. Learning to construct a portfolio of stocks can be hard too. But looking at different factors, such as dividend growth, can help investors screen in, or screen out, various stocks and strategies. Finding a unique strategy is entertaining—and rewarding too.

1,"Heading into the coming December quarter earnings season, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish surveyed 35 “channel partners” on the state of the enterprise technology market. In a research note Wednesday, he writes that his biggest takeaway from the survey is that the picture looks better for software players than for hardware vendors. Fish, who does this exercise on a quarterly basis, found insights in the survey for multiple companies.Fish reports that the survey points to potential earnings upside for virtualization and cloud computing software company            VMware       (ticker: VMW), as well as for            Nutanix      (NTNX) and            Akamai Technologies      (AKAM). Nutanix provides hybrid cloud software, while Akamai is a content delivery network and one of Fishs top infrastructure picks. Fish’s other top infrastructure picks are            Cloudflare      (NET) and            RingCentral      (RNG). He adds that the survey results lead him to be incrementally more bullish on VMware, Zoom Video (ZM) and            Arista      Networks (ANET). The analyst, meanwhile, sees evidence of potential earnings misses at            Juniper      Networks (JNPR)—which makes networking hardware—as well as            NetScout      (NTCT) and            CommVault      (CMVLT). Netscout provides application and network performance management software, and CommVault provides data protection softwareAs a result of the survey, he is more cautious on Juniper and CommVault, along with            LogMeIn      (LOGM). He suggests a pair trade for investors of going long VMware and shorting Juniper (a bet that the stock will fall) ahead of quarterly results.Here are some brief company-specific comments from Fish based on the survey results: Write to Eric J.

0,"In a strange bit of timing, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller late Tuesday launched coverage of            Cisco Systems      stock, just ahead of the company’s October quarter earnings report due after the close of trading Wednesday afternoon.The Outperform rating for Cisco shares (ticker: CSCO) was part of Muller’s broader coverage launch on six hardware companies. He also set Outperform ratings on            Apple      (AAPL) and the audio hardware company            Sonos      (SONO). He launches with Sector Perform ratings on networking plays            Arista Networks      (ANET) and            Juniper Networks      (JNPR), as well as the contract manufacturer Jabil (JBL).Muller says the broader hardware category should benefit from multiple emerging trends, including Wi-Fi 6, 400G switching, 5G cellular, cloud, Internet of Things, smart devices, connected homes, and streaming video. Wi-Fi 6 is the next, faster generation of Wi-Fi, while 400G refers to networks carrying data at 400 billion bits per second.“Companies with expertise in designing, manufacturing, and/or selling the hardware and applicable software should be able to capitalize on these secular trends,” he writes, “but timing and volatility regarding the realization of these benefits is top of mind.”In the networking sector in particular, Muller says there are questions about cloud networking budgets for 2020, the timing of 400G switching, and the tone of telecommunications spending, leaving him to take a “cautious approach.” The analyst says Cisco is best positioned for the near term, with positive prospects long-term as well. “We expect Arista to win the 400G cycle but believe its near-term upside may be limited following its recent 2020 cloud outlook; however we believe that Arista will become more compelling as we approach the 2020 second half,” he writes. Juniper, meanwhile, is “a ‘show me’ story for the time being.”Here are brief comments from Muller on all six of the companies he now covers:Juniper and Arista were down slightly on Wednesday; the other four stocks are fractionally higher.

0,"Cisco Systems      will report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Investors are nervous on two fronts.First, there are worries about softening demand from large cloud- services providers, sparked by comments from Cisco rival            Arista Networks      (ticker: ANET). Arista shares swooned after the company recently said it had experienced a sudden softening of demand from one “cloud titan” customer, believed to be            Facebook      (FB). And second, there are fears that telecommunications and cable companies are trimming capital spending because of concern over weakness in the broader economy.Cisco (CSCO) remains the unquestioned leader in networking, but the business has matured. The company’s days of double-digit growth are long past. For its fiscal first quarter, ended Oct. 31, Cisco has forecast revenue growth of 0% to 2%, with earnings of 64 to 69 cents a share under generally accepted accounting principles, or 80 to 82 cents on a non-GAAP basis. The consensus on Wall Street is that revenue will be $13.08 billion, flat with a year ago, and non-GAAP profits will come in at 81 cents a share.The results are due on Wednesday afternoon.In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company posted revenue of $13.4 billion and non-GAAP profits of 83 cents a share, Wall Street expects revenue of $12.76 billion and non-GAAP profits of 76 cents a share for the fiscal second quarter.Cisco shares are up about 14% this year—they closed Monday at $48.10, down 1.5% on the day—but the gain largely came in the early part of the year. The stock is off about 17% since it peaked above $58 in July, amid concerns about weakening spending by both public cloud-services providers and carriers. Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a research note that he isn’t expecting any meaningful upside in either the first-quarter results or the outlook for the second quarter, but he said that fears of an Arista-style meltdown are unwarranted. “Cisco’s diversified customer base provides a significant offset to issues with any one client; no customer accounts for more than 10% of sales,” he wrote. “In addition, while we expect cloud customer spend to remain volatile, we do not expect a widespread halt in cloud spend near term.”Suva noted that cloud sales account for less than 30% of Cisco’s revenue, and that expectations for cloud-related capital spending have generally been revised lower. He also said third-quarter results from telco and cable companies suggest that their capital spending is under pressure and that their spending forecasts are gradually declining. Still, he maintained his Buy rating and $57 price target on the shares. J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chaterjee has an Overweight rating and $62 price target on Cisco shares. Still, he cautioned that recent data points on enterprise IT spending have been “mixed,” including soft outlooks from both rival            Juniper Networks      (JNPR) and Cisco supplier            Marvell Technology Group      (MRVL). “We do not rule out a conservative guide once again largely given limited confidence in resilient spending trends for the next three months if concerns relative to global growth persists,” he wrote.On Monday, Piper Jaffray analyst James Fishcut his rating on Cisco shares to Neutral from Overweight, with a new price target of $51, down from $55. “Our downgrade centers on a slowing macro-environment across Enterprise and Service Provider,” he wrote, saying that he sees the “downside as fairly limited from here.” Nomura Instinet’s Jeffrey Kvaal said in his quarterly preview note that he thinks expectations for the current quarter are too high, given a weakening economy, weak service provider spending “and possible challenges at smaller cloud players.” Kvaal maintained a Neutral rating and $47 price target.

1,"Arista Networks      shares are trading lower Thursday after Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal cut his rating on the network equipment provider to Neutral from Buy, while chopping his price target on the shares to $230 from $290. In a research note, Kvaal cautions that a recovery in the company’s business with public cloud customers could be “protracted”—and that Arista (ticker: ANET) could lose market share to rival switch-makers in the second half of 2020.Kvaal chopped his profit forecast for 2020 to $10.12 a share, from $10.48, which already was below consensus at $10.53. Arista has said the new normal growth rate for its “webscale” segment—a reference to large public cloud players like            Alphabet’s      (GOOGL) Google,            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and            Microsoft      (MSFT)—is in the low single digits, the analyst wrote in a research note. He adds that demand for switches in the second half of next year could be muted, “as rival switches are now sufficient to serve as a second source.” Kvaal points in particular to potential market share losses to            Juniper Networks      (JNPR) at Microsoft, a factor he fears will offset improved spending growth in the sector and “weigh on Arista’s multiple.”Kvaal asserts that “Arista’s forward P/E multiple is only starting to reflect decelerating revenue growth.” He notes that the stock’s price/earnings multiple has declined from over 40 in early 2018 to 20-25 lately. Kvall reports that Arista’s average multiple since its IPO has been 30, but notes that he doesn’t see Arista returning to the 30%-plus revenue growth exhibited during its first years following its IPO. “The last time ANET shares traded between 20x and 25x forward earnings was in 2016, when the company was still posting 30-40% YoY growth,” he writes. “We believe a low-20x multiple is more appropriate for this long-term mid-teens grower.”Arista is down 3.2%, at $221.06, in Thursday trading. The        S&P 500      is up 0.3%. Write to Eric J.

0,"Juniper Networks      shares have been going nowhere for years now. Once viewed as the primary threat to            Cisco Systems      ’ dominant position in the networking equipment business, the company has struggled to grow: Revenues in 2018 were down 8% and flat with 2014.But Needham analyst Alex Henderson sees reasons for optimism. On Monday, he raised his rating on Juniper (ticker: JNPR) to Buy from Hold, setting a target of $29 for the stock price. Shares were up 45 cents, or 1.9%, to $24.31 in afternoon trading, though the stock was still down more than 7% year to date.Henderson wrote in a research note that he came away from a recent visit with management thinking that the dynamics of the optical networking market “may give Juniper some renewed life after several years of persistent declines.” He thinks the company will stabilize its financial results in the third quarter, returning to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2020, aided by a rebound in cloud spending.A return to growth in the fourth quarter could give the stock a lift, he said.The Needham analyst noted that Juniper posted mid-teen percentage declines in revenue in each of the last two fourth quarters. “Against one of the worst prints in a long time in last year’s fourth quarter the comparison looks to be relatively easy,” he wrote. Over the past three years, Juniper’s earnings have been hurt by a product-mix shift toward lower-cost networking gear used by cloud networks, but the move has now run its course, he said.He also noted what while cloud-spending levels this year have been a challenge for even the best companies in networking and optical hardware, commentary from Cisco (CSCO), Juniper, and            Arista Networks      (ANET) suggests a stronger year in 2020.“We don’t tend to play washed out technology stocks,” Henderson wrote. “We have been a long-term bear on Juniper, believing its exposure to routing and persistent cost and growth pressures represent significant challenges both near-term and long term. The stock has languished for a number of years even as Juniper has executed buybacks and large restructurings. Numbers have been pretty flat and the company has struggled to breach the $2 per share in earnings mark.” Now, though, the “valuation looks washed out,” Henderson said. “Juniper has several opportunities to get back on track.” Write to Eric J.

0,"Juniper Networks      (ticker: JNPR) stock was heading lower Monday after a            Citigroup      analyst cut his rating on the stock to Sell from Neutral.Citigroup’s Jim Suva also reduced his price target on Juniper shares to $24 from $28.Suva says the downgrade reflects “a reduction in sales” as the company loses market share in the networking equipment market to both Arista (ANET) and Cisco (CSCO). “We do not have any financial cash flow or going concern issues but simply believe the stock price will trade lower as our indications become reality in the months ahead,” he writes.For the second quarter, Suva sees sales of $1.099 billion, down 9% year over year and toward the low end of the company’s guidance range of $1.07 billion to $1.13 billion. He expects profits of 38 cents a share, within the company’s guidance of 36 cents to 42 cents a share, but below the Wall Street consensus at 40 cents.For the third quarter, Suva sees sales in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.14 billion, down 6% at the midpoint, with profits of 42 cents to 48 cents a share.

0,"These are interesting times for anyone interested in technology—or science fiction. Unconstrained computing power and data storage are enabling artificial intelligence, deep learning, and autonomous driving. In a couple of years, we’ll see superfast 5G networks that are expected to make today’s mobile internet access seem like a dial-up connection. Investors shouldn’t fall prey to the same enthusiasm, though. Before that future arrives, investors will have to navigate a slowing economy and the usual difficulty of discerning winning technologies versus winning stocks—since one does not necessarily lead to the other.To tackle all of this, Barron’s sat down with New Street Research technology infrastructure chief Pierre Ferragu at the investment research boutique’s office in Manhattan’s Flatiron District. Its open floor plan has a European-design sensibility, yet resembles a small trading operation—a book of Richard Avedon photos makes way for whiteboards covered with remnants of S-curves and math equations as oversize Bloomberg screens flash green and red. Ferragu, 44, joined New Street last year looking for “freedom of thought.” He began his career at the Boston Consulting Group, where he advised management teams at media and technology companies; he joined Bernstein in 2008 to make the leap to investment research. But technology is not just a sector in the S&P 500 index—it’s also a part of every sector, and Ferragu wanted more freedom to make connections and draw insights from disparate industry groups that can sometimes cause turf wars among analysts. With degrees in sociology and computer science—and a noticeable French accent—Ferragu seems as comfortable talking about AI as he is about Plato. We spoke more about the former than the latter, as well as the future of            Tesla       (ticker: TSLA) and his rationale behind his love of semiconductor companies. What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation.   Barron’s: Let’s start with your broad view: What’s driving the most technological change?   Ferragu:  We have a new era, driven by one major trend, which we wrongly call AI—artificial intelligence. I like to call it artificial stupidity.  You have to explain that. Why is AI stupid?  It doesn’t have what you would normally call intelligence. AI is doing three things: The first is classification, finding commonalities in features to classify a data set. The second is deep learning—the ability to take a fairly complex object and to deconstruct it. The third is reinforcement learning—you get a feedback loop that helps you try different things, and keep what works best. *12-monthSource: BloombergBut throughout all three steps, not at a single point are you demonstrating intention. Intention is looking at a picture and understanding what it represents. Like a picture of a dog playing with a ball. There is no entity in the AI process that understands “this is a dog.” That’s very different than intelligence. Of course, that doesn’t mean AI is not good. AI is amazing. It plays Go better than humans. It plays chess better than humans. But it’s brute force that works, not a smart algorithm. That’s artificial stupidity.  What has enabled the development of AI?  Every algorithm was invented in the late 1980s; algorithms haven’t really changed. But AI started taking off at the beginning of the 2010s, when processing power became available. AI started in the cloud, with the guys who had their own private data centers. Now, because the cloud is open to any user, we’ve entered this phase of democratizing AI; anyone can connect to             Amazon.com’s       AWS or             Microsoft’s       Azure. Phase three of AI is gathering data on the ground, at the edge. “        Artificial Intelligence is brute force that works, not a smart algorithm. That’s artificial stupidity.”        ” So artificial intelligence isn’t happening just in the cloud anymore—those complex decisions are being made in the device, like a phone or a car? Yes. That’s the reason that I want to cover the space in a very broad way. It’s about what’s happening at the edge, how the products of Tesla and            Apple      AAPL are evolving. And it’s about how the technology of            Qualcomm      QCOM,            Intel      INTC, and            Nvidia      NVDA is evolving.  The chips that go into everything are getting much smarter. We had a world in which you had only Intel. Now you have Intel and Nvidia developing chips.            Xilinx      XLNX and 2,000 start-ups are developing new chips for new workloads. From an investor perspective, all of these new products and applications would be a huge growth story. But it will be more difficult to code winners and losers. The equipment manufacturers will win whatever happens. They’re the arms dealers. And that’s the reason we cover            ASML       ASML.Netherlands and            Applied Materials      AMAT.  Historically speaking, the companies that make semiconductor equipment are more cyclical than semiconductor stocks. Will they have a smoother ride going forward? The cycle is still part of the story for the stocks. We’ve moved from an industry that was driven by PCs, to PCs and smartphones; now it’s PCs and smartphones and data centers and cars and new devices. That fragmentation helps make the industry as a whole less cyclical. In addition, the industry has consolidated on the supply side. Intel has high market share. You have only three or four memory chip manufacturers. So I think the semiconductor industry is becoming less cyclical. You see it this year. You saw it in 2013. In 2008 and 2009, even 2011, semiconductor earnings were reduced by two-thirds on a cyclical pullback. Today, pullbacks are hurting earnings in the range of 15% to 20%. It’s much, much less.  What does that mean for investors? These stocks are becoming, on average, more expensive. But semiconductor equipment makers are still the best area for investment.  You probably want to segment semi-cap in three different revenue drivers. One is the actual equipment, the hardware that makes the chips. That is the most cyclical, companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research LRCX. The second is the consumable. As these manufacturing technologies become more involved, they consume very advanced materials like chemicals, filters, and gases. That’s what a company like            Entegris      ENTG provides. And that business is not driven much by capital equipment. If you look at Applied Materials, 20 years ago its business was really to design equipment, manufacture it, and sell it to            Samsung Electronics      005930.Korea. Today, Applied Materials’ business is about solving a process step for Samsung.  So the third big revenue driver for semiconductor equipment makers is a more custom process, designing equipment along with their customers? That’s very different from the past. Yes. For instance, ASML introduced a new generation of technology called EUV extreme ultraviolet lithography; it is the most extreme form of light you can imagine. Each tool costs more than $100 million. On top of that, these tools require very, very complex consumables. And these tools have a 10-year-plus life. What ASML has introduced in the pricing is that clients pay for the tool upfront, but they also pay a fee per every wafer processed by the tool. So over the full lifetime of the technology, ASML is going to make more through the noncyclical recurring part of the business than from selling the tools themselves. Do you like the stocks from these companies?  Yes. Most leading-edge technology comes out of ASML, Applied Materials, and Lam. So those are the names I like over a long-term horizon. Lam and Applied Materials remain extremely cyclical— and we are at the low point in the cycle, so I would like to own these names today. Right? But with a very clear caveat that it’s a pure cycle play. ASML, however, benefits from the transition to extreme ultraviolet light. So this transition is not being really affected by the downturn. It is a name to own. I like these three as very strong cyclical plays on the rebound. But, of course, I don’t really have a view on whether we are touching the bottom of the cycle.  Besides equipment makers, are there other tech companies that act as “arms dealers?” Telecom companies are deploying more and more data centers, and less and less routers. So            Cisco      Systems CSCO,            Juniper Networks       JNPR, and the fixed business of            Nokia       NOK are under the secular headwind. More of the routing functions are happening on servers, on Intel. Intel’s telecom story is important, but it’s a broader data-center play. Data centers don’t work without its chips.  Let’s talk about Tesla. It seems that auto analysts don’t like Tesla and non-auto analysts like it. Why do you like Tesla, and what do traditional car people miss in your estimation? If you look at Tesla as part of the car industry, you compare it to players that have been manufacturing cars for 100 years. When you look at the world from that angle, Tesla is weak. It has very little experience. But if you look at Tesla from the perspective of disruption, Tesla has been designing, manufacturing, and improving electric cars for 10 years. And in that game, others have zero, no experience at all. So Tesla is likely to take at least 20% market share of the luxury market over the next five to 10 years, and that means it will be selling three million cars a year at some point.

1,"The next salvo in the escalating battle between the U.S. and China could come through an executive order that bans U.S. telecom companies from using equipment from certain foreign companies. Any order would largely be directed at Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies. The ban, based on national-security concerns, could be good for Huawei’s rivals, problematic for foreign telecom operators, and worrisome for those keeping tabs on the deepening rift between the two economic superpowers.The Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order for such a ban. The overall effort is aimed at keeping certain foreign-company equipment out of the next generation of wireless networks, or 5G. Shenzhen-based Huawei, the world’s largest telecom-equipment maker, is in the crosshairs of the push. It has risen to dominance by often providing more-advanced and lower-cost gear than rivals and is now akin to            Apple      (AAPL),            Qualcomm      (QCOM), and            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) rolled into one. But Huawei has also long drawn scrutiny from U.S. security and intelligence officials, who have warned that its equipment could be used for spying by the Chinese. Privately held Huawei has denied the allegations, and officials have said the U.S. should offer evidence to prove its charges.Analysts describe a ban on the use of Huawei in U.S. telecom networks as mostly symbolic, given its limited presence here; many major U.S. carriers have said they won’t use Huawei for 5G. But a ban would bolster the case the U.S. has been making to allies to blacklist Huawei from their networks—where its gear is much more prevalent. The obvious loser from a ban is Huawei, but it would probably try to offset lost sales by intensifying its push into emerging markets, while continuing to reduce its dependence on U.S. companies, says TS Lombard China policy analyst Eleanor Olcott. Huawei didn’t respond to a request for comment about a potential ban. European telecom operators could be among the losers if governments there ban Huawei from their respective networks. Many telecom operators in Germany and Britain use Huawei’s equipment. United Kingdom–based            Vodafone Group      has said it is temporarily halting purchases of Huawei gear for the core of its 5G network.Removing and replacing Huawei gear with other, higher-priced alternatives could cost the industry billions of dollars, analysts say. Three of Germany’s telecom operators use Huawei in their networks. European telecoms have warned that cutting out Huawei could delay the 5G rollout on the Continent by at least two years.Australia was among the first to ban Huawei, and the companies that took the biggest hit were telecom operators like            Singapore Telecommunications      ’ Optus and            TPG Telecom      (TPM.Australia), says Chris Lane, Asia-Pacific telecom analyst for Sanford Bernstein. TPG shares fell 33% from late August to the end of the year. No one walks away a clear winner from a Huawei ban. But in the near term, Scandinavia’s Nokia (NOK) and            Ericsson      (ERIC) would benefit by losing their lower-cost rival in wireless-network equipment. Yet Nokia’s executives were hesitant to trumpet the prospects of market share gains in a recent conference call for fear of raising China’s ire and risking their sales in the world’s largest 5G telecom-equipment market, says Krishna Chintalapalli, a telecom analyst at Ariel Investments.Of the two firms, Nokia has more areas where it can gain share because it also competes with Huawei in its optical and routing businesses. The diversity in its business and a more attractive valuation are among the reasons that Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold favors Nokia, citing the diversity in its business and a more attractive valuation. At a recent price of $6.36, Nokia trades at roughly 19 times earnings-per-share estimate for the next 12 months, slightly below its five-year average, while Ericsson, at $9.38, trades around 23 times, slightly above its average. Leopold has an Outperform rating on Nokia and sees 18% upside for the stock. He has a Market Perform on Ericsson. But any Huawei benefit won’t be immediate. “Any transition is like turning around an oil tanker situation. It can take multiple quarters, even more,” Leopold says. Samsung Electronics      (005930.Korea) is a smaller rival in telecom equipment but could also benefit as telecom operators try to hedge their bets and diversify their equipment suppliers. The company’s deep pockets could allow it to increase spending to fight for some of the market share and close the gap with its rivals. Huawei also dominates optical equipment, and a backlash against the Chinese company could help its two biggest rivals in that business, Nokia and            Ciena      (CIEN). The impact may show up more in Ciena’s results since it is a pure play in the optical space, Leopold says. On the router side of the business, Cisco and            Juniper Networks      (JNPR) could gain some share if telecom operators move away from Huawei. Carriers’ equipment is the main pipeline for data traffic and therefore most vulnerable to a cyberattack or cyberespionage. Both Juniper and Cisco have the advantage of not having much business in China, insulating them from potential retaliation. Leopold rates both companies at Overweight, with a price target of $28 for Juniper and $52 for Cisco, upside of 5% and 9%, respectively.For some companies, the threat of retaliation is real, given China’s willingness to boycott products from specific nations. Korean cosmetic makers and tour operators experienced that treatment in late 2017 after South Korea installed a U.S.-made antimissile system. But when it comes to technology, China may have a harder time with such boycotts. “Maybe Nokia’s market share goes down a bit, but I don’t see them kicking out Western companies completely,” Chintalapalli says. “Their domestic market is large, but if they become a tech island nation, they can’t see what others are doing and be a fast follower. That stymies the innovation they are trying to get.”  Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.comThe next salvo in the escalating battle between the U.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1," The Powell Put. Stocks surged on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged and signaled flexibility in scaling back its balance sheet. All three major indexes ended the day with gains of more than 1%. Other upbeat news helped as well.            Apple      (ticker: AAPL) sales were better than feared.            Boeing      (BA) revealed strong earnings and guidance, and the ADP employment report suggested that more jobs were added in January than expected. Continuing U.S.-China trade talks have also raised hopes for a deal. In today’s After the Bell, we…   Cheering on the Pause The Fed’s dovish statement led to solid stock gains. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      surged 434.90 points, or 1.77%, to 25,014.86. The        S&P 500      added 41.05 points, or 1.55%, to close at 2681.05, and the        Nasdaq Composite      added 154.79 points, or 2.20%, to end at 7183.08.The central bank kept rates unchanged, as expected, coming out of its January Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “The central bank’s apparent attempts to mend fences continues with today’s statement, backing away from ‘further gradual increases’ in rates, and instead emphasized being patient in its assessment of the need for additional tightening,” wrote Jim Baird of Plante Moran Financial Advisors in a research report published Wednesday. The Fed also indicated that it’s prepared to make adjustments to the balance-sheet runoff in response to economic and financial developments. “The Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal-funds rate,” the Fed stated on Wednesday.The statement formalizes the dovish shift by the Fed that had been indicated in recent speeches, Michael Shaoul of Marketfield Asset Management wrote in a report. It’s more comparable with the Fed’s stance in early 2016 than to the past 12 months under Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s leadership. “Given the strength of current U.S. economic data (particularly labor market data) and the recovery of asset markets from their December lows, this is about as radical a shift that could have been expected,” Shaoul wrote.According to the current dot plot, the Fed still sees an additional two more hikes to its short-term interest rate in 2019. But the capital markets remain skeptical about that target. The fed-funds futures are still pricing in roughly a 70% probability that the central bank won’t raise rates at all this year. “There is still a distinct disconnect between the Fed’s forecast and investor expectation,” Baird wrote. “The question will be whether or not the current slowdown in growth overshoots policy makers expectations and requires them to adopt an even more dovish stance, or if the recent downturn in investor sentiment proves to be overly pessimistic.”On another front, the U.S. and China started high-level trade talks on Wednesday in Washington D.C. Pressure to cut a deal is on both sides. China is eager to boost its trade flow given the lagging economic growth. President Donald Trump and his administration need a political victory before the 2020 election, as the tariff tiff has made some business groups and Trump-supporting constituencies unhappy. Dimitar Gueorguiev, an assistant professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, expects the U.S. to come out of this week’s negotiations with a favorable resolution, at least for a short-term goal: Creating an even playing field for trade and protecting American workers.“The Trump administration, for electoral cycle reasons, is likely biased to win the short game and might come away satisfied with a big trade concession,” Gueorguiev wrote in a note. “Likewise, Xi’s administration is biased to lose the short game, in part because the concessions are in some respects consistent with domestic upgrading policy.” The Hot Stock Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      shot to the top of the S&P 500 Wednesday, thanks to an upbeat fourth quarter and forecast.

0,"It has become so easy to make money in the stock market that the famous dart-throwing monkeys who have long beat human stockpickers have reportedly turned in their lanyards. In this era of low interest rates, anyone with an online trading account has a great chance at making money just by buying almost anything that moves. And incredibly, almost everyone gets to trade commission-free. Nothing, seemingly, can derail the bull—not even            Apple’s      (ticker: AAPL) recent warning that the coronavirus crisis in China would hurt future earnings. The        S&P 500      index remains near record highs. The semiconductor sector—which is a proxy for the economy because chips are in everything—is also at historic highs. Everything is so incredibly bullish that you could probably make loads of money just by rubbing your hands together and saying, “Abracadabra, give me some dosh.”The options market, which typically prices stocks as if the apocalypse started yesterday, is now pricing higher highs in the stock market. And in another reversal, call options are now generally more expensive than put options.Rather than bemoan this historic advance and tell you to hedge with inexpensive puts to protect gains, let’s focus on upside opportunities. Earnings season will soon end, and companies will begin hosting investor day, or analyst day, meetings. Many investors don’t know that these are legitimate trading opportunities because the events aren’t always advertised, and the Street tends to not make a big deal about them. But a            Goldman Sachs      study has found that the meetings consistently generate gains. Companies often offer greater details about operations, strategies, and financial outlooks at the meetings. The information is then reflected in analyst’s reports, and sometimes even in their earnings models and ratings. This creates a halo around the stock, and shares advance in expectation of a brighter future.Anyone who systematically bought calls on liquid U.S. stocks ahead of every investor day over the past 18 years had an average annual gain of 21% above costs, according to Goldman. So far this year, the strategy has returned 28%. The trading system is simple: Buy calls five days ahead of the event, and close calls one day after the event. John Marshall, a derivatives strategist at Goldman, recently told clients that the options market fails to sufficiently price the potential for volatility around these events. “Unlike earnings, which occur with a fixed quarterly frequency, analyst days can be held many years apart, making it difficult to employ a systematic trading strategy around these events.

0," Back in the Green. The main U.S. stock indexes edged back to positive territory on Thursday after dipping into the red briefly. There were no major headlines on the trade front Thursday, but concerns still loom that Beijing might weaponize its dominant position in rare-earth metals to fight back against the U.S. Not to mention recession fears are back as the yield curve remains inverted. Retailer stocks rose as            Burlington Stores      (ticker: BURL),            Dollar Tree      (DLTR), and            Dollar General      (DG) all delivered strong earnings for the first quarter. Meanwhile, the Justice Department wants            T-Mobile      (TMUS) and            Sprint      (S) to create a new wireless carrier—with its own network—as a condition to clearing their $26.5 billion merger. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Time For a Cut? The stock market was quiet on Thursday heading into the last day of May. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      rose 43.47 points, or 0.17%, to close at 25,169.88, while the        S&P 500      edged up 5.84 points, or 0.21%, to close at 2,788.86 and the        Nasdaq Composite      added 20.41 points, or 0.27%, to 7567.72.First-quarter growth in gross domestic product was revised to an annual rate of 3.1% from 3.2%, a slightly better result than the 3.0% investors had expected. Initial jobless claims—the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits—rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended May 25, suggesting the labor market remains on solid footing even as the economy is slowing.Investors are waiting for more macro data to be released Friday, including the official Purchasing Managers Index out of China and the U.S. personal income and spending report—a key indicator of inflation.The economy is in a Goldilocks status now. Unemployment is near 50-year lows, and inflation expectations are stable below the 2% target. Still, some have called for the Federal Reserve to cut rates and move faster than it did in previous cycles to shore up growth, given the looming disruptions from the U.S.-China trade war.In a Thursday speech in New York, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the U.S. economy is in good shape, but that the central bank would consider cuts in interest rates should economic data reveal a sharper-than-expected slowdown. “If we saw a downside risk to the outlook, then that would be a factor that could call for a more accommodative policy,” he said.With one more day to go, May is likely the first negative month of the year for stocks, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow down more than 5% so far. But June can be even worse for stocks, wrote LPL Research strategist Ryan Detrick, if history offers any clues. Historically, June has tended to be a laggard. “Going back the past 20 years, only September has been worse on average, and returns have been quite poor in June after a big drop in May,” wrote Detrick on Thursday.When the S&P 500 has lost more than 5% in May—only four other times in the past 50 years besides 2019—stocks subsequently fell more than 5% in June half of the time. However, when the S&P 500 was up more than 10% year to date heading into June—like this year—the S&P 500 has gained nine of the past 12 times, at an average 1.9%.Hold on to your seats. The Hot Stock Keysight Technologies      (KEYS) surged 11.36% to $79.49 after beating second-quarter earnings estimates. “In the second quarter, we saw growth across most end markets as customers continued R&D investments in next-generation technologies,” CEO Ron Nersesian said in a statement. The Biggest Loser PVH (PVH) tumbled after the clothing company, which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, announced weak quarterly guidance. PVH stock fell 14.56% to $84.49, even though it posted earnings per share and revenue roughly in line with expectations for its latest quarter.

1," One More Day Down. Stocks fell Monday, with all three major market indexes ending in the red, and the Nasdaq seeing the worst of it. With seemingly no end in sight to tariff tensions, more investors are feeling rattled about the prospect of a prolonged trade war. Tech was one of the hardest-hit sectors Monday, as Google and other companies reportedly took steps to cut ties with China’s Huawei Technologies after a U.S. blacklisting. Ford Motor      (ticker: F) announced plans to streamline by 7,000 white-collar jobs, or about 10%, to save an estimated $600 million a year. Shares of            Sprint      (S) and            T-Mobile US (TMUS)      jumped after the head of the Federal Communications Commission announced Monday that he will support a merger between the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Tech Feels the Heat The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      fell 84.1 points, or 0.33%, to close at 25,679.90. The        S&P 500      tumbled 19.3 points, or 0.67%, to end at 2840.23, and the        Nasdaq Composite      dove 113.91 points, or 1.46%, to close at 7702.38.Investors continue to evaluate the consequences of the Huawei ban announced on Friday, which could jeopardize the success of the trade talks with China and impact many of the Chinese giant’s American partners.Already, chip makers including            Intel      (INTC),            Xilinx      (XLNX), and            Broadcom      (AVGO) have reportedly told employees that they will not supply products to Huawei until further notice. Mobile-phone-parts producer            Lumentum Holdings      (LITE) confirmed it would halt shipments to Huawei, and cut revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. Google’s parent company            Alphabet      (GOOGL) has also suspended business activity with Huawei that involves the transfer or hardware, software and other key technical services.The coming week will likely remain volatile for stocks, Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group wrote in a report. A slew of U.S data expected to release this week, as well as the minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting, should provide the market with some updated clues. But it is still too soon to see any impact of the escalation of the trade war on data, which explains why investors are reacting so strongly to headlines, wrote Lawler.“Whilst the latest headlines over Canada are supportive of sentiment, a news bite which increases risk aversion could be just around the corner. Investors know this and are on edge right now,” he wrote. “That won’t change overnight.”U.S. oil prices rose on Monday as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies inched closer to extending production cuts until the end of the year. The group agreed last December to cut output by a collective 1.2 million barrels a day. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, closed 0.5% higher at $63.10 a barrel on Monday, the highest closing price in nearly three weeks.“Oil has already rallied around 40% since the start of the year, thanks mainly to OPEC limiting supply,” wrote Lawler, “Investors had been growing nervous that OPEC could look to remove the production limits at its next meeting in June, in light of tightening global supply and elevated prices.” The OPEC production cuts have offered significant support to oil prices, wrote Lawler. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have also sparked fears of supply disruptions and played a role in oil’s rally. Recent attacks on tankers floating near Iran have led to high tension in the region.Oil’s moderate price increase today, however, was rather a humdrum response to the OPEC news, Barron’s noted. Investors are now worried about oil demand at the same time, given the reignited trade wars and slower global growth. The International Energy Agency reduced its estimate for 2019 oil demand in a report on Wednesday. Demand in Brazil, China, and Japan has lagged the IEA’s estimates this year.  The Hot Stock TechnipFMC      stock (FTI) climbed to the top of the S&P 500 on Monday, on news that its joint venture with Russia’s largest private gas producer will lead to a new liquefied-natural-gas plant.TechnipFMC stock gained 64 cents, or 2.9%, to $22.97.The energy-services firm said Arctic LNG 2, its joint venture with Novatek, will build an LNG plant, deepening their partnership.In the trailing 12-month period, TechnipFMC stock is down 32.8%. The Biggest Loser Keysight Technologies      stock (KEY) fell to the bottom of the index on Monday, following an analyst downgrade.Keysight stock dropped $7.30, or 8.9%, to $74.56. Robert W. Baird analyst Richard Eastman downgraded the electronics-testing equipment and software maker’s stock to Neutral from Outperform, and lowered his price target to $82 to $90, citing the ongoing tariff pressure on the tech sector. “Huawei is a small direct Keysight customer; however, the negative indirect impact (customers as vendors to Huawei) could weigh on Keysight’s growth rate,” Eastman wrote. “What’s bad for the U.S. tech Industry isn’t a positive for Keysight. China-related uncertainty may be an overhang on the shares in the near term.”Keysight stock is up 38.5% in the past 12 months. –Teresa Rivas Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com One More Day Down.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Revenue and profit estimates for the semiconductor industry continue to ratchet lower, amid a range of both supply-chain and demand issues. And the same process is under way for the chip equipment makers that serve them. But for both sectors, there are values to find if you know where to look.This morning, UBS chip analyst Timothy Arcuri reset estimates for his entire coverage universe, which includes all of the major chip and equipment companies. For most of the companies he covers, he reduced revenue forecasts for both 2020 and 2021, and he brought price targets down for most of the stocks he covers as well. He also shifted some ratings around. In a few cases, he’s feeling more bullish.Arcuri notes that revenue for the semiconductor industry fell 35% in two quarters during the 2008-09 downturn, and took three quarters to fully recover. But he adds that comparisons are easier this time, coming off a weak 2019, especially for memory chips. He writes that his new base case is for a 20% drop in semiconductor revenues through the September quarter with a gradual recovery to parity by June 2021. Calendar 2020 revenues, he says, will be off 15%-20% from pre-virus estimates. He adds that “computer” related stocks—            Intel       (ticker: INTC) and            Nvidia       (NVDA), for instance—should be more defensive, and that supply constraints should help on memory. (He likes            Micron.      ) But he sees risks for smartphone-related stocks, and weakness in the automotive chip sector.For the equipment sector, he says, revenue will follow semis lower, but he’s more bullish on the group than he is on chips. He says that “supply constraints should keep order books full making the snap-back faster than for semis,” and he adds that there are “few if any weak balance sheets among top chip spenders.” Arcuri also notes that Chinese customers “remain full speed ahead and may even accelerate timeliness.”Arcuri on Friday lifted his ratings on            Lam Research      (LRCX) to Buy from Sell and on            KLA       (KLAC) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) to Neutral from Sell. He also upgrades            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Neutral from Sell.His bullish stance on Lam reflects the company’s out-sized exposure to the memory sector. He writes that Applied has growing exposure to memory, though he is concerned about the company’s display business, and he sees risk in its large exposure to the contract chip manufacturer            Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM). He says KLA should get a boost from supply constraint issues in the equipment sector, though he thinks the story in the foundry and logic end markets—where KLA has significant exposure—isn’t as compelling as it is for memory.On Texas Instruments, Arcuri says that he still has concerns about their big exposure to the automotive and industrial vertical markets, but that the issue is already reflected in the stock price. “Virtually all of the company’s revenue growth over the past 4 years has come from this vertical so this remains a concern as we look forward but the sell side has also been aggressively cutting global production estimates over the past few weeks and highly visible production shut-downs in Europe make it hard to argue that investors have not contemplated this as a risk,” he writes.In Friday trading, amid a sharp market slide, chip and equipment stocks are trading lower across the board, with Lam, Arcuri’s favorite, down 6.4%, to $243.42.

1,"Amid the market uncertainty over the effects of the coronavirus outbreak,            JPMorgan      believes            KLA      (KLAC) is still seeing solid business trends and its stock is an attractive buying opportunity.Chip stocks have tumbled, along with equity markets. The         iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (ticker: SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, has declined by about 25% over the past month, compared with the 24% drop for the S&P 500. KLA stock is down 22% in the same period.On Thursday, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur reaffirmed his Overweight rating for KLA after meetings with the company’s executives. The company is a leader in the chip-making equipment tool market.We “came away with a view that the company’s industry equipment spending outlook … is looking incrementally better,” he wrote. “We believe the team is also seeing better-than-expected trends within their specialty semiconductor segment on strong RF, power semiconductor, and advanced packaging demand.”KLA was down 4.8% to $137.98 on Thursday. Sur has a $210 price target on the stock.The analyst cited how the company already included a 3% to 5% negative sales impact from the coronavirus in its March quarter guidance. He is optimistic over how KLA is managing the virus outbreak’s impact on its supply chain.“We do not expect COVID-19 to result in significant demand destruction as the investments, especially at the leading edge, are strategic in nature and KLA’s equipment is required by its customers to improve yield and manufacturability,” he wrote.Wall Street analysts are mixed on KLA. About 56% have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 39% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet.

0,"In the latest signal that the chip industry is headed for a pick up in demand after a weak 2019, the world’s leading chip manufacturer for hire reported strong fourth-quarter results, better-than-expected first-quarter guidance, and spending plans for 2020 that should please investors in semiconductor-equipment stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM) posted fourth-quarter revenue of $10.39 billion, up 10.6% both from a year ago and from the third quarter, but slightly below the Street consensus forecast at $10.46 billion. Profits were 73 cents a share, ahead of the Street consensus view at 71 cents.“Our fourth quarter business benefited from strong demand for high-end smartphones, initial 5G deployment and high performance computing related applications using TSMC’s industry-leading 7-nanometer technology,” TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said in a statement. “Moving into first quarter 2020, despite mobile product seasonality, we anticipate our business to be supported by the continued ramp of 5G smartphones.”For the first quarter, the company sees revenue of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion, above the previous Wall Street analyst consensus at $10.1 billion. TSMC sees gross margin of 48.5% to 50.5%, versus 50.2% in the fourth quarter, and slightly above guidance, with operating margin of 37.5% to 39.5%, which compares with 39.2% in the fourth quarter, and just ahead of the guidance range.TSMC projects a capital spending budget this year of $15 billion to $16 billion, up from the $14.9 billion the company spent in 2019, a number that itself was about $400 million above Street estimates.  Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini this morning reiterated his Positive rating on the stock, lifting his target on TSMC’s shares to $74 from $70. He notes that the company’s strong Q1 guidance reflects growing demand for chips used in both 5G and high-performance computing applications. He notes that the stock has recently come under some selling pressure on fears of trade issues and advises investors to buy the stock here. Citi analyst Atif Malik writes in a brief research note this morning that TSMC’s spending plans are well above his previous projection of $14.5 billion. Malik notes that TSMC said it expects to spend 80% of its 2020 capex budget on advanced process technologies—at 7nm line widths and smaller—and adds that the company’s robust spending plans comes as good news for the semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector.Malik notes that TSMC expects 5G and high-performance computing applications to drive strong demand over the next several years. The company sees 20% growth this year for smartphones and high-performance computing, with mid-teens growth for automotive applications and wearables. Stifel analyst Patrick Ho likewise comments in a research note this morning that TSMC’s spending plans are “a modest upside surprise” for semiconductor equipment stocks. Some chip investors get nervous when chipmakers are spending on new capacity; the industry tends to overshoot and create price-crushing over-supply. But Ho isn’t worried. “Ultimately, while some may be concerned over this high forecast of capex and equipment spending, we believe that strong demand in these markets and differentiated and leading process technology is driving this capex spend,” he writes. “Customers need to pay for this capacity increase if the demand is as healthy and robust as TSMC and other forecasters see,” Ho says. “More importantly, we believe some of these demand trends could be sustainable and could keep capex elevated going into 2021. This upside surprise is part of our overall favorable sentiment entering 2020 and we maintain our positive view on the group and the stocks at this time.”TSMC shares were recently up slightly to $58.52. Among semiconductor equipment stocks,            Applied Materials      (AMAT),            KLA       (KLAC), and            Teradyne      (TER) are all up about 1%.

0,"Everyone loves a comeback story. Especially investors.To identify the stock market’s best 2019 comebacks, Barron’s ranked the companies in the        S&P 500      index by their 2018 and 2019 price changes. We then calculated the difference in the price changes to come up with the best improvements. It’s worth noting that a stock that falls 50% one year, needs to gain 100% in the following year to reach break-even.Lam Research      (ticker: LRCX) topped the list. It soared 117% in 2019, following a 26% decline in 2018, for a delta of 143 percentage points.Chips and chip equipment makers dominate the list of comeback stocks, reflecting what bulls think will be an upturn in memory chip demand starting in 2020. Investors are hoping that 5G wireless services will drive an uptick in mobile phone sales, along with a pickup in chip demand from public cloud companies. Here’s a list of the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with the most dramatic reversals of fortune. (The data reflect the stocks’ closing prices on Dec. 26.) Lam Research (LRCX)  Price change, by year  2018: -26%,  2019: +117%  Lam’s rebound was part of a broad 2019 recovery in companies that make chip manufacturing hardware. Lam expects to see a pickup in spending on memory chip manufacturing in 2020 and beyond, with continued stable demand from logic chip companies and contract chip manufacturers. Over the last two years combined, Lam stock is up 59%.Coty (COTY)  2018: -67%  2019: +67%  In July,            Coty      announced a turnaround plan intended to “drive substantial improvement” in its consumer beauty business while deleveraging and improving profitability. In November, the company announced a deal to buy a 51% stake in Kylie Jenner’s company Kylie Cosmetics for $600 million. Coty is still down 45% over the last two years. Western Digital (WDC)  2018 -54%  2019 +70%  With the 2015 acquisition of SanDisk,            Western Digital      has become a bet on memory chips—with both DRAM and NAND memories expected to show better pricing and improved demand in 2020 and beyond. The stock is down 22% over the last two years.Applied Materials      (AMAT)  2018 -36%  2019 +87%  Like Lam, Applied is benefiting from anticipation of improving demand for chip making gear. On the company’s most recent earnings conference call, CFO Daniel Durn said that “while it’s always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it’s a matter of when, not if.” Shares are up 19% over the last two years.Arconic (ARNC)  2018 -38%  2019 +85%  The specialty metals company, spun off from            Alcoa      (AA) three years ago, rejected a buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in January. Instead, the company has filed with the SEC to split in two, with one company focused on aerospace and the other on autos—a move investors expect to unlock value for shareholders. Arconic shares are up 14% over the last two years.Xerox Holdings      (XRX):  2018 -32%  2019 +90%  Xerox shares have gotten a boost from the company’s aggressive cost-cutting moves, as well as its decision to sell its long held joint venture in Japan with Fujifilm. In recent weeks, the focus has shifted to the company’s bold unsolicited bid for            HP      (HPQ). Xerox is up 28% over the last two years.Fortune Brands Home & Security      (FBHS)  2018 -44%  2019 +72%  Fortune makes cabinets, plumbing supplies, and other home building wares. While the company said in reporting third-quarter results that the market had been slower than expected, it also said that there was a pickup in demand in September and October from both the new construction and home repair markets. Starting in January, President and COO Nicholas Fink becomes CEO, taking over for Christopher Klein, who is retiring. The stock is down 4% over the last two years.KLA (KLAC)  2018 -15%,  2019 +100%  The semiconductor capital equipment firm is seeing good demand from the logic chip sector, and it sees broad trends driving growth in 2020 and beyond. CEO Rick Wallace said on the company’s latest conference call that “the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence growing semiconductor investment in China, and continued device and process innovation.”            KLA      shares are up 69% over the last two years. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  2018 -29%  2019 +82%  Skyworks makes radio chips for mobile phones, which are expected to see accelerating demand in 2020 with the arrival of the first 5G handsets. The stock is up 27% over the last two years.General Electric      (GE)  2018 -57%  2019 +54%  After a disastrous 2018, GE shares are showing signs of life. Investors seem to have gained confidence that GE has gotten a grip on its operating issues. Bulls expect improvements ahead at GE Power, continued solid performance at GE Healthcare, and growth in aircraft leasing. That said, its aircraft engine business remains vulnerable to the continued troubles with            Boeing’s      737 Max aircraft. GE shares are still down 33% over the last two years.

1,"It’s been an odd year for semiconductor stocks. Fundamentally, 2019 has been challenging. For the full year, industry revenue, excluding the volatile memory sector, will be down 6% to 8% this year, after 8% growth in 2018, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur. But the stocks have been on a rip-roaring rally. The strong performance reflects anticipation of better fundamentals ahead—a recovery Sur thinks will drive further stock gains.So far this year, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (ticker: SOX) has soared 55%, well ahead of the 32% gain for the        Nasdaq Composite      and a 26% rally by the        S&P 500.      In a research note Monday morning, the J.P. Morgan analyst writes that he sees the rally extending from here. Sur projects 15% to 20% gains for the average semiconductor stock over the next 12 to 18 months, as fundamentals improve. He projects 2020 overall semiconductor industry revenue growth of 4% to 7%, with profits improving 8% to 12%.“We see strength in mobile, gaming, datacenter, and PCs with industrial demand trends likely to improve in 2020—overall driving a positive year-over-year cyclical inflection in industry growth” starting in the first half of 2020, he writes. “Longer-term, we continue to expect the semiconductor industry to exhibit relatively stable and less cyclical growth characterized by low-to mid-single-digit percentage annual revenue growth and high single-digit percentage unit growth.”Sur’s top pick in semis is            Broadcom      (AVGO), based on “under-appreciated diversification,” strong free cash flow, and dividend growth. Other picks, by sector:All of the analyst’s recommended stocks are trading higher Monday amid a broad market rally. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 1.7%. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedLarge-cap semiconductor-equipment stocks, including            Applied Materials      and KLA, came under selling pressure Thursday after a bearish call on the group by            UBS.Analyst Timothy Arcuri says the stocks will face headwinds ahead as spending by chip makers peaks in the near term and then contracts for a few quarters. Arcuri writes in a series of research notes that stocks in the group “have always followed quarterly revenue.” He sees risk to estimates through 2020 given what he says has been “a very extended run-rate” in equipment from the foundry and logic chip sector. He thinks 2021 will be “a good year driven by memory,” but that the industry is currently running above the levels he expects.Arcuri cuts his ratings to Sell from Neutral on Applied Materials (ticker: AMAT), to Sell from Buy on            KLA      (KLAC) and to Sell from Neutral on            LAM Research      (LRCX). He also cut price targets on Applied to $48, from $49 and on KLA to $140, from $192. He keeps his Lam target at $240.The analyst writes that demand from the foundry/logic “appears overextended.” He says demand from the memory sector “has barely ramped off the bottom,” but that he doesn’t see enough of a broad recovery in equipment demand from memory chip companies to offset “a potentially big reversion” in foundry and logic.In today’s trading, Applied is off 3.5%, to $57.54; KLA is down 6% to $163.31, and Lam is down 3.3% to $265.12.

Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures,        S&P 500      futures as well as        Nasdaq Composite      futures are all off about 0.1%. The small premarket index moves, however, belie a lot of activity going on below the surface.For starters, CNBC reportedCharles Schwab      (ticker: SCHW) is interested in buying            TD Ameritrade      (AMTD). Ameritrade shares are up more than 20% in premarket trading. Schwab stock is up 7.3%. Peer            E*Trade Financial’s      (ETFC) shares have actually fallen 1.9%. Perhaps investors are worried            E*Trade      will be competitively disadvantaged by a larger rival. Other M&A news is sending another company’s shares higher. Shares of luxury goods retailer            Tiffany & Co      (TIF) are up 3.8% after multiple reports of continuing M&A interest from            LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton      (MC.France). News of a potential bid for Tiffany originally surfaced in October. But it isn’t all good news for investors. Makers of equipment for semiconductors are falling in premarket trading after UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri downgraded three to the equivalent of Sell.            KLA      (KLAC) is down 2.1%,            Applied Materials      (AMAT) is 3% lower, and            Lam Research      (LRCX) is off 2.6%. Its worth keeping in mind, though, that the tech trio has had an incredible run so far in 2019, up about 90% on average. Finally,            Macy’s      (M) reported earnings Thursday morning. The stock is down almost 5% in premarket trading. Earnings beat Wall Street expectations, but the company lowered it full-year sales and earnings guidance.

1,"Semiconductor-makers have faced a tough environment in 2019: high growth expectations have come up against the trade-war and economic-slowdown headwinds. But after these stocks plummeted late last year on those concerns, they have rebounded to outperform the market in year to date. Where the sector goes next is a subject of disagreement on Wall Street. The back story. Semiconductor and semiconductor-equipment makers belong to an inherently cyclical industry that sees periodic episodes of booming growth followed by inventory corrections—the current situation. After strong industrywide sales growth of 8% in 2018 excluding memory, the sector is on track for a 6% drop this year. The U.S.-China trade war has extended the current downturn. Most major semi players have been caught in the middle of the conflict, with supply chains and customers on both sides of the Pacific.The            iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (ticker: SOXX)—which tracks an index of U.S. semiconductor companies—tumbled a steep 18% in the second half of 2018 through Christmas Eve, after dividends, versus a 12% loss for the broader        S&P 500.But so far this year, investors have been willing to give semiconductor stocks another chance. Wall Street estimates for chip company earnings came down, managements reset their forward guidance, and the stocks have still bounced back. The semiconductor index has returned over 32% this year versus 17.5% for the S&P 500. What’s new. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur sees that outperformance continuing through the second half of 2019 as both supply and demand sides of the equation improve for semiconductor companies.“We remain confident in a second-half pickup in overall demand with near seasonal demand in PC computing, wireless/wired infrastructure (around 5G), aerospace/defense, smartphones (ex-Huawei), consumer/gaming, and a resumption in cloud/hyperscale spending trends,” Sur wrote in a report on Wednesday morning. The end of the year is a seasonally strong period for orders of chips used in PCs, smartphones, and gaming consoles, according to Sur. Ongoing 5G deployment in the U.S. and abroad will boost demand for wireless infrastructure products. He also expects data center capital expenditures to increase by as much as 30% over the first half of 2019, powered by big spending from the likes of             Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Facebook      (FB), and            Microsoft      (MSFT) on artificial intelligence and cloud chips.Others see a hazier near-term picture for semiconductor stocks. Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong noted in a report published Tuesday that total global semiconductor sales have declined at least 15% year over year in May, June, and July. Recently issued forward guidance from several chip companies implies continued sales declines in the fall, he added.“With the continuing U.S. restrictions on shipments to Huawei and rising tariffs on Chinese goods into the U.S., we think the chance of a meaningful recovery in chip end-market demand in 2019 is unlikely,” Wong wrote. “Our projections assume year-over-year declines in global chip sales in every month through the rest of this year.”For the full year 2019, Wong projects a 15% decline in semiconductor sales.Sur also acknowledges that the U.S.-China trade war, global economic data, and restrictions on doing business with Huawei could all be sources of volatility for semiconductor sector stocks. Looking ahead.            J.P. Morgan’s      Sur recommends buying diversified semiconductor companies exposed to growth in datacenter, automotive, and industrial products. He has Overweight ratings on            Broadcom      (AVGO),            Intel      (INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Micron Technology      (MU),            Marvell Technology Group      (MRVL),            Texas Instruments      (TXN), Inphi (IPHI), and            KLA      (KLAC).Nomura’s Wong, meanwhile, is largely neutral on the sector, including Nvidia, Micron, Texas Instruments,            Xilinx      (XLNX),            Applied Materials      (AMAT), and            Analog Devices      (ADI). He rates Intel and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      stocks as Buy.

0,"Stock in            Applied Materials      hasn’t felt the slowdown in smartphone shipments or semiconductor sales—at least not in 2019. Applied Materials stock (ticker: AMAT) is up 47% year to date, far better than the 13% gain in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      over the same span. What’s more, semiconductor capital equipment firms—companies that produce equipment used to make microchips—have far outpaced the 25% year-to-date gain of the        Philadelphia Semiconductor Index      (SOX). Lam Research      stock (LCRX), for instance, has risen like Applied Materials, jumping 51% year to date.            KLA      stock (KLAC) is also up almost 52% year to date. Test equipment maker and collaborative robot producer            Teradyne      (TER) has soared almost 72% so far in 2019. As Applied Materials prepares to report quarterly earnings on Thursday after the market closes, here are some key points to watch for if the industry’s momentum will continue, along with some recent history.  Finally, as is the case with all companies, analysts will want to check in on trade. “Last update from Applied indicated the company put in place plans to offset most of the impact from tariffs,” Twigg wrote. With more tariffs on the way, trade will stay in the headlines and tech companies with Asian exposure will be a good place for investors to look for relevant data points.

1,"Chip stocks are gyrating on trade-war uncertainty this month. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is telling investors that some chip stocks are worth buying after Tuesday’s announcement about delaying tariffs on some products. The semiconductor sector is exposed to global trade-conflict sentiment, as China and the U.S. represent key end markets for the industry, and most of its supply chain is in Asia.On Tuesday, technology stocks surged on the U.S. government’s decision to postpone tariffs on select product categories—including cellphones and laptop computers—imported from China. But the sector lost much of those gains on Wednesday on recession fears after the yield curve inverted.“Even if tension easing proves to be just symbolic (kicking can down the road)…it’s a near-term sentiment positive and shows US/China governments can be flexible,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya wrote on Tuesday.He noted that the tariffs postponements on some goods are strategically timed to avoid most of the holiday shopping season. Here are three Buy-rated chip stocks that Arya says may do well under the “Trade Thaw.”Nvidia      (NVDA)Arya has a $225 price target for Nvidia stock, which was trading around $149 per share on Wednesday. The chip maker has a “superior long-term growth profile in large, underpenetrated markets,” he wrote.Analog Devices      (ADI) Arya has a $130 price forecast for Analog Devices stock, which was trading around $110 per share on Wednesday. He said the chip maker has “best-in-class profitability.”KLA-Tencor      (KLAC)The analyst has $150 target for the chip equipment maker, whose stock was trading around $131 per share on Wednesday.

Just a few weeks ago, there were four U.S. companies with market valuations above $1 trillion, all of them tech stocks. Those companies—Microsoft (ticker: MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)—with their fortress-solid balance sheets, are poised to come out of the downturn just as strong as they went in.

All Rights ReservedRevenue and profit estimates for the semiconductor industry continue to ratchet lower, amid a range of both supply-chain and demand issues. And the same process is under way for the chip equipment makers that serve them. But for both sectors, there are values to find if you know where to look.This morning, UBS chip analyst Timothy Arcuri reset estimates for his entire coverage universe, which includes all of the major chip and equipment companies. For most of the companies he covers, he reduced revenue forecasts for both 2020 and 2021, and he brought price targets down for most of the stocks he covers as well. He also shifted some ratings around. In a few cases, he’s feeling more bullish.Arcuri notes that revenue for the semiconductor industry fell 35% in two quarters during the 2008-09 downturn, and took three quarters to fully recover. But he adds that comparisons are easier this time, coming off a weak 2019, especially for memory chips. He writes that his new base case is for a 20% drop in semiconductor revenues through the September quarter with a gradual recovery to parity by June 2021. Calendar 2020 revenues, he says, will be off 15%-20% from pre-virus estimates. He adds that “computer” related stocks—            Intel       (ticker: INTC) and            Nvidia       (NVDA), for instance—should be more defensive, and that supply constraints should help on memory. (He likes            Micron.      ) But he sees risks for smartphone-related stocks, and weakness in the automotive chip sector.For the equipment sector, he says, revenue will follow semis lower, but he’s more bullish on the group than he is on chips. He says that “supply constraints should keep order books full making the snap-back faster than for semis,” and he adds that there are “few if any weak balance sheets among top chip spenders.” Arcuri also notes that Chinese customers “remain full speed ahead and may even accelerate timeliness.”Arcuri on Friday lifted his ratings on            Lam Research      (LRCX) to Buy from Sell and on            KLA       (KLAC) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) to Neutral from Sell. He also upgrades            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Neutral from Sell.His bullish stance on Lam reflects the company’s out-sized exposure to the memory sector. He writes that Applied has growing exposure to memory, though he is concerned about the company’s display business, and he sees risk in its large exposure to the contract chip manufacturer            Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM). He says KLA should get a boost from supply constraint issues in the equipment sector, though he thinks the story in the foundry and logic end markets—where KLA has significant exposure—isn’t as compelling as it is for memory.On Texas Instruments, Arcuri says that he still has concerns about their big exposure to the automotive and industrial vertical markets, but that the issue is already reflected in the stock price. “Virtually all of the company’s revenue growth over the past 4 years has come from this vertical so this remains a concern as we look forward but the sell side has also been aggressively cutting global production estimates over the past few weeks and highly visible production shut-downs in Europe make it hard to argue that investors have not contemplated this as a risk,” he writes.In Friday trading, amid a sharp market slide, chip and equipment stocks are trading lower across the board, with Lam, Arcuri’s favorite, down 6.4%, to $243.42.

1,"As the coronavirus spreads beyond China, Italy and South Korea are focal points for investors worried about the growing scope of the outbreak. Barron’s dug into U.S.-listed companies with exposure to those two countries.We looked at all stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges and trade at least 100,000 shares a day, on average. Of those stocks, four were companies that generated at least 10% of 2019 revenue from Italy, where at least 322 people had been confirmed to have contracted the virus and 10 have died as of Tuesday afternoon.  Barron’s found 18 U.S.-listed companies that get at least 10% of revenue from South Korea, where the World Health Organization counts 763 cases and 7 deaths. (The virus is also spreading in Iran, but sanctions limit U.S. companies’ activity there).Here is a look at the U.S. companies most exposed to Italy and South Korea. ITALY  International Game Technology      (ticker: IGT)  The electronic-gaming equipment and software maker, based in London, gets more than a third of its revenue (37.6%) from Italy. Since the start of the year, the stock has tumbled 18%. Much of that decline came this week, as global indexes slid on virus fears. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.86. For reference, the        S&P 500       has a P/E of 20.8. Dana       (DAN)  This Ohio-based company makes power-conveyance and energy-management solutions for vehicles. About 14% of its sales come from Italy. Like IGT, Dana has dropped 18% since the beginning of January. It is trading at 5.2 times earnings.  Guess       (GES)  Italy accounts for 12% of revenue for the apparel company. The stock has fallen 17% this year. With a P/E of 15.9, it is still relatively expensive compared with other U.S. stocks exposed to Italy.  CNH Industrial      (CNHI)  The agricultural-equipment and commercial-vehicle maker, based in London, derives 11% of total sales from Italy. The stock was up slightly on Tuesday amid a sea of red, but it is still down 20% since the start of January. CNH is trading at a P/E of 8.8.  SOUTH KOREA  Universal Display      (OLED)  The maker of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), based in New Jersey, gets 62% of its revenue from Korea. Investors have taken the stock—which gained 126% in 2019—lower by 25% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 53.9. Xperi       (XPER)  For the San Jose semiconductor company, South Korea accounts for 52% of sales. The stock has fallen 3% since the start of 2020, a loss that appears contained in part because it has given up 26% over the past 12 months.  Onto Innovation      (ONTO)  The chip company, based in Massachusetts, gets a third of its revenue from South Korea. The stock has dropped 8% this year but is holding on to a 14% gain over the past 12 months. It is trading at 63.4 times earnings.  MagnaChip Semiconductor      (MX)  The Luxembourg-based company also gets about a third of total sales from Korea. Despite a 13% decline this week, shares are up 9% since the start of January.  Photronics      (PLAB)  This one is another chip company, based in Connecticut. It derives 27% of revenue from Korea. The stock has lost 20% this year after gaining 62% in 2019. Its P/E stands at 27.9. Silicon Motion Technology      (SIMO)  This Hong Kong-based chip maker gets a quarter of total revenue from Korea. Its stock has fallen 20% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 20.2. Ceva       (CEVA)  For the Mountain View, Calif.,-based company, 24% of sales come from Korea. Though down 10% this week, this one is up 11% on the year.  Lam Research      (LRCX)  Another California chip maker, Lam derives 23% of sales from Korea. Another highflier in recent years, the stock is down 7% this week. It is holding on to a 0.7% gain for the year and is trading at a P/E of 21.1. Coherent Inc.      (COHR)  The California-based industrial laser company derives 22% of revenue from Korea. The stock is down 21% since the start of the year and is trading at a P/E of 88.9. FormFactor      (FORM)  The semiconductor maker, also based in California, gets a fifth of its revenue from Korea. The stock, still up 40% over the past 12 months, is down 11% since the beginning of the year. Its P/E stands at 45. Nu Skin Enterprises       (NUS)  Based in Provo, Utah, Nu Skin sells personal-care products and nutritional supplements, deriving 14% of its revenue from Korea. Shares have dropped 35% this year, bringing the loss over the past 12 months to 58%. The stock is trading at 8.9 times earnings.  Acushnet Holdings      (GOLF)  For the golf-products maker, which owns the Titleist brand and is based in Massachusetts, Korea makes up 14% of total sales. The stock has declined 16% this year and is trading at a P/E of 18.2. Applied Materials      (AMAT)  The California chip maker derives 13% of revenue from Korea. The stock gained 82% in 2019 and has hung onto most of that gain. Year-to-date, shares are down 3.5%. It trades at a P/E of 19.3. KLA Corp. (KLAC)  KLA is another California semiconductor company, reliant on Korea for 13% of its sales. Shares have declined 16% since January, leaving its gain over the past 12 months at 29%. The stock trades at a P/E of 17.3. eBay Inc.      (EBAY)  For the online auction platform, Korea represents 11% of revenue. The stock has slipped 4% this week but is still up 1.5% on the year, following reports it may sell its classified-ads business for around $10 billion. eBay has a P/E of 14.5. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  This Massachusetts chip company also gets 11% of its revenue from South Korea. Shares are down 12% since the start of the year after gaining 78% in 2019. Skyworks P/E stands at 20.3. Synopsys      (SNPS)  A 10th of this electronic design company’s revenue comes from Korea. The California company’s stock has fallen 5.2% this week but is hanging onto a 1.8% gain for the year. It is trading at 41.4 times earnings. Lumentum Holdings      (LITE)  The optical and photonic product maker, based in California, derives 10% of overall sales from Korea. Shares in the company have fallen 1.1% this year after gaining 53% in 2019. Its P/E stands at 47.03.

1,"Chip stocks are falling on uncertainty over the coronavirus. But analysts so far are relieved the negative sales impact on forecasts isn’t larger.On Tuesday,            Qorvo      (ticker: QRVO) lowered its March-quarter sales guidance by $50 million from the midpoint of its prior range to $770 million. After the release, Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman reaffirmed his Outperform rating for the chip maker. “Given our view of the broad impact to production in MarQ, the company’s revenue outlook for MarQ is much better than we thought,” he wrote. “Qorvo represents a unique, underappreciated paly on higher RFFE RF front-end content in 5G handsets.”Ackerman believes the company will capture more chip-market share from the top six smartphone makers in the world.Qorvo makes radio-frequency, or RF, semiconductors, which enable smartphones to communicate with wireless networks. The company’s stock was down 1.7%, at $98.77, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      was down 1.9%.One major chip-equipment maker also said the negative impact thus far from the outbreak on demand wasn’t significant. “We’re looking at this every day,” Doug Bettinger, the chief financial officer of            Lam Research      (LRCX), said during a visit to Barron’s Tuesday. “We have not seen any change in customer demand as a result of this. Customer demand is still very strong.”To be sure, business trends and outlooks can always deteriorate further if infections accelerate around the world. But so far, at least, it seems chip stock analysts aren’t overly worried yet.

0,"U.S. stock futures are getting crushed because the coronavirus is spreading outside of China.  Italy now reports 150 cases and three deaths attributed to the virus. The        Borsa Italiana      is plummeting, down 4.8% in overseas trading. Other overseas stock exchanges are in the red as well. The U.K’s        FTSE 100 Index      has fallen 3.5%.        ﻿      Hong Kong’s        Hang Seng Index      is off 1.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures fell by 2.4%, or more than 700 points, while        S&P 500      futures dropped 2.4%. Futures on the tech-heavy        Nasdaq Composite,      off 3.2%, are being hit hardest. Investors appear worried about the impact the virus can have on semiconductor-supply chains. The bulk of the world’s microchips are made in Asia. Stock in            Lam Research      (ticker: LCRX), for instance, is down 8.1% in premarket trading. Stock in travel-linked companies are getting hit too. Cruise operators            Carnival      (ticker: CCL) and            Royal Caribbean Cruises      (RCL) shares are down 6.5% and 4.3%, respectively.            United Airlines      (UAL) shares are off 3.4%. Haven assets and health-care stocks are rising. Stock in gold miner            Newmont      (ticker: NEM) is up 3.7% in premarket trading. Biotechnology company            Gilead Sciences      (GILD) has risen 2.7%. And shares of            Lakeland Industries      (LAKE), a maker of personal protective equipment, have jumped 13.2%. It’s difficult to separate the effects of the disease from the impact of other events, but shares of a few companies are moving for reasons that are clearly not virus-related. Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK.B) released fourth-quarter earnings Saturday that missed Wall Street’s expectations. Shares are down 5.2% in premarket trading. Warren Buffett’s company continues to sit on a cash pile of more than $120 billion. Investors are anxious to see Berkshire use its assets more aggressively. Berkshire shares underperformed the U.S. stock market recently, but its history of returns under the leadership of Buffett and Charlie Munger is remarkable. A thousand dollars invested in 1965 would be worth more than $27 million in 2020. The comparable number for the S&P 500 is about $200,000. Boeing      (BA) shares are down more than $10, or 3.1%. The Wall Street Journal reported the company will offer financial support to suppliers affected by the halt to production of the company’s 737 MAX jet, which has been grounded worldwide for almost a year due to safety concerns. Boeing believes it can bring the MAX back into commercial service by mid-2020. Stock in cannabis producer            Tilray      (TLRY) is down 4.4% after brokerage firm Cowen downgraded the stock from the equivalent of Buy to Hold.

0,"It has become so easy to make money in the stock market that the famous dart-throwing monkeys who have long beat human stockpickers have reportedly turned in their lanyards. In this era of low interest rates, anyone with an online trading account has a great chance at making money just by buying almost anything that moves. And incredibly, almost everyone gets to trade commission-free. Nothing, seemingly, can derail the bull—not even            Apple’s      (ticker: AAPL) recent warning that the coronavirus crisis in China would hurt future earnings. The        S&P 500      index remains near record highs. The semiconductor sector—which is a proxy for the economy because chips are in everything—is also at historic highs. Everything is so incredibly bullish that you could probably make loads of money just by rubbing your hands together and saying, “Abracadabra, give me some dosh.”The options market, which typically prices stocks as if the apocalypse started yesterday, is now pricing higher highs in the stock market. And in another reversal, call options are now generally more expensive than put options.Rather than bemoan this historic advance and tell you to hedge with inexpensive puts to protect gains, let’s focus on upside opportunities. Earnings season will soon end, and companies will begin hosting investor day, or analyst day, meetings. Many investors don’t know that these are legitimate trading opportunities because the events aren’t always advertised, and the Street tends to not make a big deal about them. But a            Goldman Sachs      study has found that the meetings consistently generate gains. Companies often offer greater details about operations, strategies, and financial outlooks at the meetings. The information is then reflected in analyst’s reports, and sometimes even in their earnings models and ratings. This creates a halo around the stock, and shares advance in expectation of a brighter future.Anyone who systematically bought calls on liquid U.S. stocks ahead of every investor day over the past 18 years had an average annual gain of 21% above costs, according to Goldman. So far this year, the strategy has returned 28%. The trading system is simple: Buy calls five days ahead of the event, and close calls one day after the event. John Marshall, a derivatives strategist at Goldman, recently told clients that the options market fails to sufficiently price the potential for volatility around these events. “Unlike earnings, which occur with a fixed quarterly frequency, analyst days can be held many years apart, making it difficult to employ a systematic trading strategy around these events. We believe this leads to relatively low option prices heading into the event, providing an edge to fundamental and generalist investors,” he wrote. Marshall advised his clients to focus on investor days as the next potential source of single stock volatility after earnings season. Option prices on single stocks have declined. One-month implied volatility on the average S&P 500 stock is at 22, down three points from January highs.Goldman told clients to focus on these investor day meetings:            Hasbro      (HAS) and            Mattel      (MAT) on Feb. 21;            Mimecast      (MIME) on Feb. 24;            Arconic      (ARNC),            Deluxe      (DLX), and            Freshpet      (FRPT) on Feb. 25;            Chevron      (CVX),            Keysight Technologies      (KEYS),            Lam Research      (LRCX), and            F5 Networks      (FFIV) on March 3;            Zendesk       (ZEN) and            Centene      (CNC) on March 4;            United Airlines      (UAL),            Exxon Mobil      (XOM), and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) on March 5;            Big Lots      (BIG) on March 9;            Alteryx       (AYX) and            Cerner      (CERN) on March 10;            Parker Hannifin      (PH) on March 12; and            Illinois Tool Works      (ITW) on March 13. Each of those 20 meetings is a major event-driven trading opportunity. If you’re interested, review the list, pick call options at, or just above, the underlying stock prices, and have at it. Do it for the monkeys.

1,"It’s no secret that Wall Street’s estimates for companies’ earnings are set to be beaten. Managements are good at managing analysts’ expectations, so that they can exceed a lower bar. “Generic Company Incorporated Beats Wall Street Forecasts” is a nice headline to get, and if the rest of an earnings report is free of red flags, a bump in the company’s stock can follow.On an aggregate level, S&P 500 earnings per share tend to beat estimates by several percentage points each quarter. In the third quarter of 2019, the S&P 500 EPS surprise rate came in at 4.7%, according to Credit Suisse’s chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub. It has been as high as 7.6% and no lower than 3% in the past five years.A few companies have been particularly consistent in turning in higher earnings per share than Wall Street expects. Nine firms in the S&P 500 have done so for at least 20 straight quarters.Here’s how much they’ve tended to beat by and how their stocks have reacted the following day:Source: FactSetUnfortunately for many of those companies, investors seem to have come to expect higher-than-expected earnings. That sounds like an oxymoron, but only three of the nine stocks on the list have averaged a post-earnings move of greater than 1% in the past five years:            Estee Lauder      (ticker: EL),            Lam Research      (LRCX), and            Thermo Fisher Scientific       (TMO).Northrop Grumman      (NOC) has the best track record of beating estimates. Its earnings per share have come in more than 16% ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts, on average, in the past 20 quarters. But the price impact on the stock has tended to be modest, averaging 0.8%. Perhaps the defense contractor’s whisper numbers—unpublished forecasts that circulate on Wall Street—are well known and investors are expecting better results than the semiofficial consensus forecast.And, of course, a company’s earnings per share are but one of the many data points it releases in each quarterly report. An EPS a couple of cents higher might not be all that impressive if management simultaneously cuts its forecasts for its earnings or revenue, for example.That’s what            Stanley Black & Decker      (SWK) did last January. The toolmaker reported $2.11 in earnings per share for the last quarter of 2018, ahead of the $2.10 analysts estimated. It registered as an EPS beat, but the company’s outlook for 2019 was gloomy. Stanley Black & Decker shares dropped almost 16% after the report.In fact, shares of Stanley Black & Decker,            Snap-on      (SNA), and            Omnicom Group      (OMC) have each fallen, on average, following their earnings reports over the past five years. That is even though EPS was higher than expected every single quarter. It’s a reminder to not pay too much attention to whether companies do better than the average of forecasts by Wall Street analysts indicates they will. Quarterly earnings beats might get the most headlines after companies report, but they’re just one small part of the picture.

All Rights ReservedThe Dogs of the Dow beat stock market averages during the decade just ended. What’s more, Barron’s found that “small dogs” offer investors superior dividend yields without sacrificing too much return. How do fast dogs—the stocks with the fastest dividend growth—perform? As it turns out, pretty well. That’s a good boy. We’re a little obsessed with dogs. There is good reason though. The Dogs of the Dow is a time-tested strategy that buys the 10 highest dividend yielding stocks in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      each year. It’s a simple, repeatable strategy and it has worked. A strategy like that is the Holy Grail for investors. The success of the Dow Dogs is also what led Barron’s to dive into other simple, repeatable—and potentially winning—investment strategies. The Small Dogs are the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Russell 2000 small capitalization index with market values over $1 billion. Small-cap stocks are typically more volatile than larger companies. We showed investors cut some of the risk of owing small stocks while receiving much higher than average dividend yields. Now for the greyhounds. The Fast Dogs strategy looks at companies growing dividend payouts at the fastest rate. The        S&P 500      was our sample set. Fast Dogs just nosed out the        S&P 500      over the past three years. Outperforming in 2017, underperforming in 2018 and, essentially, matching the market in 2019. A longer historic look would be helpful, but dividend growth data is harder to come by than just dividend yields. Barron’s suspects two fundamental reasons Fast Dogs might work over the long run. First, dividend growth demonstrates to investors the future looks bright. Higher payouts are a powerful signal to investors. What’s more, investors like dividends and more money attracts more investors. The Fast Dogs for 2020 are:            Pioneer Natural Resources      (ticker: PXD),            TechnipFMC      (FTI),            Thermo Fisher Scientific      (TMO),            Newmont      (NEM),            Cimarex Energy      (XEC),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Juniper Networks      (JNPR),            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH),            Lam Research      (LRCX) and            Progressive      (PGR). That’s a nice mix of stocks across several sectors. Deciding what stocks to buy can be hard. Learning to construct a portfolio of stocks can be hard too. But looking at different factors, such as dividend growth, can help investors screen in, or screen out, various stocks and strategies. Finding a unique strategy is entertaining—and rewarding too.

0,"Everyone loves a comeback story. Especially investors.To identify the stock market’s best 2019 comebacks, Barron’s ranked the companies in the        S&P 500      index by their 2018 and 2019 price changes. We then calculated the difference in the price changes to come up with the best improvements. It’s worth noting that a stock that falls 50% one year, needs to gain 100% in the following year to reach break-even.Lam Research      (ticker: LRCX) topped the list. It soared 117% in 2019, following a 26% decline in 2018, for a delta of 143 percentage points.Chips and chip equipment makers dominate the list of comeback stocks, reflecting what bulls think will be an upturn in memory chip demand starting in 2020. Investors are hoping that 5G wireless services will drive an uptick in mobile phone sales, along with a pickup in chip demand from public cloud companies. Here’s a list of the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with the most dramatic reversals of fortune. (The data reflect the stocks’ closing prices on Dec. 26.) Lam Research (LRCX)  Price change, by year  2018: -26%,  2019: +117%  Lam’s rebound was part of a broad 2019 recovery in companies that make chip manufacturing hardware. Lam expects to see a pickup in spending on memory chip manufacturing in 2020 and beyond, with continued stable demand from logic chip companies and contract chip manufacturers. Over the last two years combined, Lam stock is up 59%.Coty (COTY)  2018: -67%  2019: +67%  In July,            Coty      announced a turnaround plan intended to “drive substantial improvement” in its consumer beauty business while deleveraging and improving profitability. In November, the company announced a deal to buy a 51% stake in Kylie Jenner’s company Kylie Cosmetics for $600 million. Coty is still down 45% over the last two years. Western Digital (WDC)  2018 -54%  2019 +70%  With the 2015 acquisition of SanDisk,            Western Digital      has become a bet on memory chips—with both DRAM and NAND memories expected to show better pricing and improved demand in 2020 and beyond. The stock is down 22% over the last two years.Applied Materials      (AMAT)  2018 -36%  2019 +87%  Like Lam, Applied is benefiting from anticipation of improving demand for chip making gear. On the company’s most recent earnings conference call, CFO Daniel Durn said that “while it’s always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it’s a matter of when, not if.” Shares are up 19% over the last two years.Arconic (ARNC)  2018 -38%  2019 +85%  The specialty metals company, spun off from            Alcoa      (AA) three years ago, rejected a buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in January. Instead, the company has filed with the SEC to split in two, with one company focused on aerospace and the other on autos—a move investors expect to unlock value for shareholders. Arconic shares are up 14% over the last two years.Xerox Holdings      (XRX):  2018 -32%  2019 +90%  Xerox shares have gotten a boost from the company’s aggressive cost-cutting moves, as well as its decision to sell its long held joint venture in Japan with Fujifilm. In recent weeks, the focus has shifted to the company’s bold unsolicited bid for            HP      (HPQ). Xerox is up 28% over the last two years.Fortune Brands Home & Security      (FBHS)  2018 -44%  2019 +72%  Fortune makes cabinets, plumbing supplies, and other home building wares. While the company said in reporting third-quarter results that the market had been slower than expected, it also said that there was a pickup in demand in September and October from both the new construction and home repair markets. Starting in January, President and COO Nicholas Fink becomes CEO, taking over for Christopher Klein, who is retiring. The stock is down 4% over the last two years.KLA (KLAC)  2018 -15%,  2019 +100%  The semiconductor capital equipment firm is seeing good demand from the logic chip sector, and it sees broad trends driving growth in 2020 and beyond. CEO Rick Wallace said on the company’s latest conference call that “the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence growing semiconductor investment in China, and continued device and process innovation.”            KLA      shares are up 69% over the last two years. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  2018 -29%  2019 +82%  Skyworks makes radio chips for mobile phones, which are expected to see accelerating demand in 2020 with the arrival of the first 5G handsets. The stock is up 27% over the last two years.General Electric      (GE)  2018 -57%  2019 +54%  After a disastrous 2018, GE shares are showing signs of life. Investors seem to have gained confidence that GE has gotten a grip on its operating issues. Bulls expect improvements ahead at GE Power, continued solid performance at GE Healthcare, and growth in aircraft leasing. That said, its aircraft engine business remains vulnerable to the continued troubles with            Boeing’s      737 Max aircraft. GE shares are still down 33% over the last two years.

All Rights ReservedLarge-cap semiconductor-equipment stocks, including            Applied Materials      and KLA, came under selling pressure Thursday after a bearish call on the group by            UBS.Analyst Timothy Arcuri says the stocks will face headwinds ahead as spending by chip makers peaks in the near term and then contracts for a few quarters. Arcuri writes in a series of research notes that stocks in the group “have always followed quarterly revenue.” He sees risk to estimates through 2020 given what he says has been “a very extended run-rate” in equipment from the foundry and logic chip sector. He thinks 2021 will be “a good year driven by memory,” but that the industry is currently running above the levels he expects.Arcuri cuts his ratings to Sell from Neutral on Applied Materials (ticker: AMAT), to Sell from Buy on            KLA      (KLAC) and to Sell from Neutral on            LAM Research      (LRCX). He also cut price targets on Applied to $48, from $49 and on KLA to $140, from $192. He keeps his Lam target at $240.The analyst writes that demand from the foundry/logic “appears overextended.” He says demand from the memory sector “has barely ramped off the bottom,” but that he doesn’t see enough of a broad recovery in equipment demand from memory chip companies to offset “a potentially big reversion” in foundry and logic.In today’s trading, Applied is off 3.5%, to $57.54; KLA is down 6% to $163.31, and Lam is down 3.3% to $265.12.

1," 5:30 p.m. It was a quiet day for the stock market—the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      finished the day down just 22.82 points. In fact, it was so quiet it felt like almost nothing happened. But the day could have been a whole lot better if it weren’t for two sectors: Energy and technology. Consider: The        S&P 500      finished the day down 5.99 points, or 0.20%, and most of its sectors did, well, nothing. On the downside, industrials dipped 0.04%, health care slipped 0.12%, and financials declined 0.24%. On the upside, consumer staples ticked up 0.09%, communications services rose 0.15%, utilities advanced 0.24%, materials gained 0.30%, and consumer discretionary finished up 0.41%. Add it up and the market might have finished higher on the day. Except for tech and energy. The energy sector fell 1.49%, making it the biggest loser on the day. Every stock in the sector, including            Exxon Mobil       (XOM) and            Chevron      (CVX), was down on the day, except one:            Helmerich & Payne      (HP), which rose 0.1% and happens to be the smallest stock in the group. Energy’s drop was particularly weird given that oil prices rose 1% to $53.36 per barrel on Wednesday. Then there was tech. It dropped less than half as much as the energy but is five times the size. And while most of tech was down, including            Apple      (AAPL) and            Microsoft      (MSFT), it was the software and chip stocks that took the brunt of the selling.            Salesforce.com      (CRM) fell 3.78%, while Adobe (ADBE) dropped 2.39% after getting downgraded by Citigroup. Chip stocks            Micron Technology      (MU) and            Lam Research      (LRCX) fell 2.39% and 3.01% respectively. Despite today’s drop, breadth was just fine. “We thought it was interesting that in spite of lower indices, there were more advancing issues than declining ones,” writes Stephen Todd of Todd Market Forecast.So we’ll try again tomorrow.

1,"Stock in            Applied Materials      hasn’t felt the slowdown in smartphone shipments or semiconductor sales—at least not in 2019. Applied Materials stock (ticker: AMAT) is up 47% year to date, far better than the 13% gain in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      over the same span. What’s more, semiconductor capital equipment firms—companies that produce equipment used to make microchips—have far outpaced the 25% year-to-date gain of the        Philadelphia Semiconductor Index      (SOX). Lam Research      stock (LCRX), for instance, has risen like Applied Materials, jumping 51% year to date.            KLA      stock (KLAC) is also up almost 52% year to date. Test equipment maker and collaborative robot producer            Teradyne      (TER) has soared almost 72% so far in 2019. As Applied Materials prepares to report quarterly earnings on Thursday after the market closes, here are some key points to watch for if the industry’s momentum will continue, along with some recent history.  Finally, as is the case with all companies, analysts will want to check in on trade. “Last update from Applied indicated the company put in place plans to offset most of the impact from tariffs,” Twigg wrote. With more tariffs on the way, trade will stay in the headlines and tech companies with Asian exposure will be a good place for investors to look for relevant data points.

0," Slumping. The three major U.S. stock market indexes fell after            Apple      said it will miss its quarterly revenue target due to the coronavirus. The virus is resulting in shortages of iPhones, while reducing Chinese demand for Apple products.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was down 213 points, or 0.7%, in early afternoon. The        S&P 500      dropped 0.5% and the        Nasdaq Composite      lost 0.3%.  Midday Movers Leidos Holdings      (ticker: LDOS) gained 9.6% after the defense contractor predicted that it will have more revenue in 2020 than analysts expected. Advance Auto Parts      (AAP) rose 7.1%. The company’s adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter came in above Wall Street forecasts.Kroger      (KR) gained 5%.            Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway      disclosed a stake in the grocer on Friday. Conagra Brands      (CAG) lost 5.2%. The food company cut its 2020 earnings guidance because of weak demand from restaurants and slow retail sales.Apple      (AAPL) lost 2.4%.

1,"Mid-cap value stocks could be the Goldilocks investment for today’s market. Eleven years into a bull run, valuations for large blue-chips are high, yet smaller, cheaper companies have weaker businesses, more vulnerable to a long-overdue economic downturn. Mid-caps may offer the bed for your assets that’s “just right”—less expensive than large, more resilient than small—especially if broader markets change course.Of the mid-cap value funds,        Wells Fargo C&B Mid Cap Value      (ticker: CBMAX) is one of the best. Its 12.5% 10-year annualized return beats 92% of its peers in Morningstar’s Mid-Cap Value fund category and its benchmark, the        Russell Mid Cap Value Index.      (The fund carries a 5.75% load, but that fee is waived at major brokers such as TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Fidelity.) To be sure, value funds have underperformed growth strategies of late—hence the opportunity in today’s extended markets.C&B Mid Cap Value is subadvised by Cooke & Bieler, a private money manager that has existed since 1949 and oversees $9.8 billion. The firm isn’t part of            Wells Fargo      (WFC). Cooke & Bieler employs an unusual managerial structure for the fund. It has eight co-managers who control their own portion of assets and buy and sell the stocks in that portion themselves. There is no “lead manager” since every co-manager is also an analyst. “We’ve built the firm so the analysts who’ve done the research are 100% accountable for the results,” says co-manager Edward O’Connor. “They don’t have to worry about what their boss thinks about an idea.” For added motivation, 40% of each manager’s compensation is determined by the performance of their stock picks versus relevant benchmarks. The freedom to control their own destiny is one reason managers who work for Cooke & Bieler tend to stay there—the firm’s average managerial tenure is 16 years. Three of the fund’s co-managers have worked on it since its February 1998 inception, including Mehul Trivedi. He interned at the firm during business school. “Ultimately, that sort of decision-making authority is what attracted me, and the compensation system,” he says. “It’s a meritocracy.”Individual managers still have to justify their stock picks to the team via a written “accountability statement,” an investment thesis describing what the manager expects from the stock. The team reviews that statement every quarter to see if the investment is living up to expectations. The fund’s portfolio typically has fewer than 50 stocks, and for a new name to be added, another usually has to leave. Assets aren’t divided equally among the managers, but based on the opportunities available in the industries each individual manager covers. Since their compensation is so heavily dependent on smart stock selection, no manager is tempted to control the entire portfolio. O’Connor covers financial services, consumer discretionary/retail, and telecom stocks, while Trivedi covers energy and technology. One stock O’Connor started buying in 2018 and continued to buy throughout 2019 is clothes retailer            American Eagle Outfitters      (AEO), now the fund’s fifth-largest holding. “Retail obviously has some structural issues with the internet i.e.,            Amazon.com      taking market share and has always been a super-competitive business,” he observes. But American Eagle—the No. 2 jeans brand in America behind            Levi Strauss      (LEVI)—has already transitioned more than 25% of its business to online and has a strong social-media presence, according to O’Connor. The managers tend to focus on finding high-quality companies first before considering valuation, and that has given the fund an edge over peers lately, when growth stocks broadly have crushed value. In general, the team seeks companies with manageable debt levels, good returns on capital, and some kind of sustainable competitive advantage. That last factor could be an oligopolistic industry structure where the company is a market leader, or high switching costs for customers to stop buying the company’s products, O’Connor says. In American Eagle Outfitters’ case, quality emerges not only from its strong position in denim, but its liquidity. The company has two dollars a share in cash on its balance sheet, O’Connor says. He notes: “Balance sheets are very important in retail because retail companies can get in trouble very quickly.”The fund’s 13.8% allocation to consumer-discretionary stocks, which includes retail, exceeds the Russell benchmark’s 9.1%. So does its 11.5% tech weighting, versus the benchmark’s 7.6%. Yet the fund’s tech holdings aren’t the typical market darlings. Early in 2019, Trivedi started buying shares of            Leidos Holdings      (LDOS), a government information-technology services contractor. After a merger with a            Lockheed Martin      (LMT) unit in 2016, the company streamlined its bidding practices for government contracts. “We see a company that is well diversified between different government agencies, whether it’s civil versus defense versus intelligence,” Trivedi says. Leidos “is winning more than its fair share of government contracts” and building a backlog of them.Currently, the fund’s largest sector weighting, though, is in industrial stocks, which account for 25.4% of its portfolio.            Hexcel      (HXL) is a typical Cooke & Bieler industrial investment, O’Connor says. It is a dominant player in a small but essential part of the supply chain for a much larger industrial process—manufacturing airplanes. “Hexcel makes lightweight, high-performance, structural material out of carbon fiber,” which is used in the housing of engines to increase their efficiency and reduce noise, he says. The stock benefits from the industry’s oligopoly structure, O’Connor adds: “There’s a lot of R&D required and strict aerospace qualifications that are involved in getting your materials to be used in airplanes.” Boeing      (BA) and            Airbus      (AIR.France) are major Hexcel customers. But because of safety problems with Boeing’s 737 MAX jet—which was grounded last year after two deadly crashes—Hexcel stock has become cheap. Hexcel’s products are vital to both companies, and Boeing’s loss likely will be Airbus’ gain as airplane manufacturing shifts. Either way, Hexcel profits. That kind of sturdy business model is exactly what makes the cheap stocks in the fund more resilient than those of its peers, and should come in handy when the next downturn finally arrives.

0,"Male chief executive officers set the strategic direction of 19 of the 20 U.S. industrial companies with market values of more than $30 billion. But things are different in defense. Women are running three of the five biggest companies handling major contracts for the U.S. military. Marillyn Hewson, one of Barron’s 2019 World’s Best CEOs, leads            Lockheed Martin      (ticker: LMT). Phebe Novakovic, who was on the 2018 list, leads            General Dynamics      (GD). And Kathy Warden took the reins at            Northrop Grumman      (NOC) in January after serving as president and chief operating officer. Shareholders may not be surprised. They are likely to be well aware of the job these leaders are doing. Lockheed stock has returned 19% a year on average over Hewson’s six-year-plus tenure as chief, while returns on General Dynamics stock have averaged more than 16% since Novakovic took over in 2013. Both figures exceed the average returns of industrial stocks in the        S&P 500      over comparable spans. It is probably too early to pass judgment on Warden’s performance, but Northrop’s stock is up 23% year to date, far better than the 12% gain of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      Those market-beating returns aren’t due to a bloated defense budget or past success in winning government contracts. The defense business can be difficult.  Read more: The World’s Best CEOs of 2019Hewson and Novakovic both had to manage through 2015, when U.S. government budget sequestration slowed military spending. And Hewson guided Lockheed through its two largest transactions of the last 20 years: the $9 billion purchase of the Sikorsky helicopter business from            United Technologies      (UTX) in 2015 and the 2016 sale of Lockheed’s information-systems business to            Leidos      (LDOS), for $6 billion. Novakovic, for her part, managed through a prolonged downturn in the business jet market. Despite their high representation in defense, the reality is that it is rare for a woman to run a big industrial company. The issue still comes up publicly: In an interview last year in Washington, D.C., Hewson reflected that she was often the only woman in the room when she started at Lockheed more than three decades ago. “Today 22% of our leaders are women, 24% or 25% of our workforce are women” she told Carlyle Group’s David Rubenstein. “So, the pipeline of women—it’s no longer the only—there’s only one woman in the room. We have many women leaders in the room.”Women fill a higher share of leadership roles at Lockheed than in the S&P 500 as a whole. About 11% of top earners in the S&P are women, according to Catalyst, a global nonprofit working with companies to “build workplaces that work for women.” (About 5% of the CEOs in the S&P 500 are women.)Northrop received a Catalyst award in 2018 for increasing the number of women and women of color in leadership positions from 2010 to 2016. Over that span, the share of women at the vice president level increased from 15% to 29%. At General Dynamics, women fill 30% of the slots on the board of directors, about 6 percentage points above the average for companies in the S&P 500. Other companies in aerospace and defense have comparable figures: Women fill more than 20% of management positions and 29% of board seats at            Boeing      (BA) and            Raytheon      (RTN), the other two so-called prime contractors in defense.It appears the entire defense industry is ahead of the curve, with about twice the rate of women in management than in the largest industrial companies. Whatever the reason, the gender breakdown looks as if it is working for shareholders. The aerospace and defense components of the S&P 500 have returned more than 15% a year on average for the past 5 years, about 5 percentage points better than the index as a whole.

0,"The        S&P 500      has staged a big comeback since the government shutdown on December 21, rallying 12.6% through Monday’s close. But a better bet has been companies that make money off the government—specifically aerospace and defense contractors. The S&P Aerospace and Defense Select Industry Index has gained 16.7% since the shutdown started. And the sector looks poised for more outperformance, according to some analysts.  Barron’s has been bullish on defense companies. As we noted in a cover story in November, agreed-upon spending will increase revenue rapidly for companies such as            Lockheed Martin      (ticker: LMT),            Northrop Grumman (NOC),      and            Raytheon      (RTN) through the end of the decade. China is developing a new hypersonic missile that could make today’s U.S. missile defenses obsolete. And President Donald Trump has signaled support for upgrading and expanding the military, from missile defenses to the Navy. Ben Phillips, chief investment officer of EventShares, says he has recently added to shares of aerospace and defense contractors in the firm’s exchange-traded fund, U.S. Policy Alpha (PLCY). “We’re buying on conviction that, over the next two years, defense spending will increase,” Phillips tells Barron’s. The stocks look relatively cheap, he adds, trading at an average 12 to 16 times forward earnings and less than 11 times enterprise value/Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Congress must still approve a defense budget for fiscal 2020, and it is sure to be a battle. The Trump administration is likely to make a final budget request of nearly $750 billion for 2020, up 4.6% from the $717 billion appropriated for 2019. Congress may well approve less than that request. Democrats in control of the House are looking to cut military spending. And there will be plenty of fights over spending levels and individual defense programs—especially if Trump attempts to carve out funding for a border wall in a defense bill.Nonetheless, analysts expect the Pentagon to prevail in funding its major programs. And even with some nips and tucks, defense contractors should continue receiving healthy levels of funding.Phillips likes companies tied to increased missile defense spending. Trump has been a big supporter of missile programs, calling for more funding for space-based systems, partly in response to threats posed by North Korea, China, and other adversaries. While missile defense will be debated heavily in Congress—and may face cuts—many defense contractors should continue to benefit. Among them, according to Phillips, are Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and            Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings      (AJRD).The Navy is also requesting more funding to modernize and expand its fleet, aiming for a flotilla of 355 ships that would include smaller, lighter vessels and unmanned robotic warships. This is a multidecade plan that likely will be batted about Congress for years. But shipbuilding and high-tech weaponry development tend to generate bipartisan support in politicians’ home districts. And Trump has supported modernizing the Navy (at least as a campaign pledge). Stocks that would benefit include            Huntington Ingalls Industries      (HII),            General Dynamics      (GD), and            BWX Technologies      (BWXT), a leading supplier of nuclear components and equipment.Two other areas that look appealing are companies involved in drone technology and the outsourcing of government workers, Phillips says.            AeroVironment      (AVAV), for instance, makes drones, tactical missile systems, and related technologies, and its sales have been rising as orders come in from the Pentagon and foreign governments. Analysts expect the company to generate $350 million in sales this year, up 18% from $296 million in 2018. One caveat: The stock is pricey at 50 times estimated 2019 earnings. Also compelling, Phillips says, are companies benefiting from the government outsourcing of more national security and defense work to external personnel. Companies that stand to gain are            CACI International      (CACI), a big player in government network cybersecurity; consulting firms            Accenture      (ACN) and            Booz Allen Hamilton      (BAH); and            Leidos Holdings      (LDOS), a diversified government contractor. None of these stocks have a straight shot up, of course. They all face headline risk as Trump and Congress battle over funding levels. Investors who want a basket of defense stocks instead should consider an ETF such as            iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF      (ITA) or            SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF      (XAR). Both have done well this year, up 11.2% and 11.7%, respectively. Assuming the world doesn’t get any safer, these ETFs are likely to be good long-term bets.

1,"Another federal contractor has spoken out against the practice of separating migrant children from their parents at the border.“The practice of separating accompanied minors from their parents is wrong, said Roger Krone, the chairman and chief executive of Leidos Holdings (LDOS), on Twitter. Our elected leaders must work together to find solutions to immigration challenges while at the same time preserving the values that make our nation great.Leidos, a Fortune 500 information technology, engineering and science company has Department of Homeland Security contracts and a market capitalization of $8.8 billion. It used to be known as SAIC, but in 2013 spun off a business that kept the SAIC name while rebranding itself as Leidos.Its CEOs criticism came on Wednesday, a day after Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadellaposted a letter calling the border policy cruel and abusive and stating that the company’s work for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not relate to separating children from families. Microsoft employees had protested the company’s involvement with the immigration agency.On Wednesday, President Trumpchanged course and instructed his administration to try to detain families together. An existing legal settlement limits the governments ability to detain children, raising the possibility of a legal challenge. Questions also remained about the future of the families already separated.Leaders of major companies, particularly in tech but also in other sectors, have publicly condemned the government’s separation of children and parents at the border.Leidos has contracts with the Department of Homeland Security to provide cyber security and data analytics and, in the area of border security, screening of cargo, baggage, and vehicles, company spokesman Jason Kello said in an email. It provides inspection technology for points of entry across the U.S., including the southern border, he said.The company does not believe any of its work for the government is connected to the separation or housing of children apart from their parents.Leidos does not provide any services or technologies we are aware of that support these actions, Kello said.Shares of Leidos were down about 0.70% this morning.

0," Maxim Group IGate is our top pick in software and services for 2015.IGate (ticker:          IGTE      ) posted 7% revenue growth in 2013 and is on pace to post 10% growth in 2014. This growth rate remains below many of its public peers, but the gap has narrowed. We believe the signing of two large deals during the first nine months of 2014 and a third expected in first-quarter 2015 will reaccelerate top-line growth in second-quarter 2015.Furthermore, iGate has aggressively hired to prepare for this ramp. Although the aggressive recruiting is a solid leading indicator, it has pressured profits in second-half 2014. In addition, the rupee has weakened another 3% compared to the U.S. dollar, and we expect this swing in currency to help partially offset the temporarily weaker utilization. We expect iGate to post about 15% top-line growth in 2015 and adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 26%. Finally, we believe iGate has a number of large deals in its pipeline to sustain top-line growth. Based on accelerating top-line growth and the implied valuation (at just under 14 times and 12 times our 2015 and 2016 adjusted EPS estimates, respectively), iGate shares are our top pick for 2015.ManTech International (            MANT      ) and WNS (            WNS      ) are our top picks for value-oriented investors. The common themes for these value-oriented stocks are cheap valuations and fewer headwinds in 2015. ManTech trades at 8 times enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EV/Ebitda) based on our 2015 estimate compared to peers CACI International (            CACI),      Booz Allen Hamilton Holding (            BAH),      Leidos Holdings (            LDOS      ) and Science Applications International (            SAIC),      which have an average multiple of 9.6 times.ManTech’s revenue and profitability have declined more rapidly given its higher exposure to Afghanistan. The lower valuation reflects the fact that more often than not, ManTech’s management has had to significantly lower its annual guidance in each of the last eight quarters. Therefore, we believe the lower valuation for ManTech stems from investors’ belief that estimates will see significant downward revisions again. The headwind for ManTech related to Afghanistan should be more muted in 2015 (8%) compared to 2014 (19%), and the rest of the business has grown sequentially for three straight quarters. Furthermore, procurement has picked up in the industry, and ManTech is bidding on a number of large contracts that could quickly change the perception of its fundamentals. As a result, we expect ManTech shares to rally in 2015 like many of its public competitors did in 2014.Similarly, WNS lost one of its largest customers in 2014 (Sabre (            SABR      ) unit Travelocity) and also agreed to lower pricing at its top customer, Aviva (          AVV),      in exchange for an extended contract agreement. As a result, top-line growth slowed, and WNS shares are trading at 13 times and 12 times our fiscal 2015 and 2016 adjusted EPS estimates, respectively.Adjusting for a modest amount of debt, WNS has about $1.70 per share in cash and has generated slightly more free cash flow than adjusted EPS in each of the last three years. Not only is most of WNS’s revenue recurring, making these events unlikely to reoccur, but the company has added a number of new customers that have the potential to become top 10 customers over the next three years and the company is positioned to gain significant share at Expedia (            EXPE),      in our opinion. As a result, we project WNS will post 10% top-line growth in fiscal 2016. We believe there is limited downside risk to WNS shares but several catalysts to stronger-than-expected results. In fact, we expect WNS’ EPS will benefit from the weak rupee. Revenue is impacted by swings in the dollar/pound rates, but there is a natural hedge with delivery personnel and therefore the impact to the bottom line is modest. -- Brian Kinstlinger To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.comwith “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

0,"Low-volatility funds are great when market volatility is sending stocks plummeting. But when volatility sends stocks sharply, and unexpectedly, higher—as happened this past week—these funds can seem alarmingly sluggish. But investors should expect more volatility in the coming weeks, months, and years—and low-vol mutual and exchange-traded funds can provide some much-needed cushion for the ride. Consider how some of these funds held up in the stomach-churning month after the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      hit its all-time high on Feb. 12: The largest such strategy, the $29.3 billion        iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA      ETF (ticker: USMV), was down 9% year to date through March 11, performing better than 96% of other large-blend funds, according to            Morningstar,      and nearly six percentage points better than the Russell 1000. The fund is up an average of 6% a year for the past five years, putting it in the top 4% of its category.  Market Data Center:  Funds & ETFs A 9% loss doesn’t sound so bad when the market is crashing. “A lot of our clients are looking to de-risk within their equity allocation rather than rely on bonds,” says Michael Hunstad, head of quantitative strategies at Northern Trust Asset Management. “Low-volatility funds make that possible because they implement an asymmetric beta strategy.” In other words, they will rise and fall with the market, but not as dramatically. Here’s what that looks like: In 2018, when the Russell 1000 fell 4.8%, the lowest-volatility stocks declined 1.6%, according to a recent analysis by Hunstad’s team. When markets recovered in 2019 and the index returned 31.4%, low-volatility stocks weren’t far behind, ending the year up 29.8%. It’s the investing equivalent of having some of your cake and eating most of it. Low-volatility stocks “certainly have a place in a portfolio,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of The Leuthold Group.Historically, there has been a strong correlation between the performance of low-volatility stocks and bond yields. “Low-risk stocks tend to be high-dividend-paying stocks,” says Joseph Mezrich, head of quantitative strategy at Nomura Instinet. But there are caveats. For starters, these funds may perform almost as well in a gradually rising market, but when stocks shot up last week, they trailed significantly. Also, the term “low volatility” isn’t absolute—it is an intention, not a promise. Fund research firms Morningstar and Refinitiv Lipper don’t even have a low-volatility category; instead, low-vol funds are categorized by size (such as small- or large-company), region, or style (growth, value, blend). All this makes choosing and comparing low-volatility funds tricky. *1 Month period through march 11. **1 Month period through March 25Source: MorningstarA low-volatility fund should not fall as much as its category peers (other large- or small-company funds, for instance), a metric known as downside capture. These funds will typically have a lower upside capture, meaning they don’t rise as much as their peers. Also look at the fund’s stock-picking criteria: Some own the stocks that demonstrated the least volatility in the prior year, which can lead to a bias toward defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples. One of the largest ETFs, the $8.7 billion        Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility      (SPLV), weights its holdings based on the 100 least-volatile stocks over the previous 12 months. Recently, these sectors have benefited (relatively speaking) from the stampede to safety. Hunstad prefers a different approach. “The last thing you want to do is buy into a low-volatility strategy that is overweight sectors that are very expensive relative to the benchmark or their own history,” he says.His team uses a quantitative process that favors high-quality names and controls for unintended active exposures, such as sector, industry, and individual stock. Recent top holdings in the        FlexShares US Quality Low Vol      ETF (QLV), launched in July, included            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ),            Verizon Communications      (VZ),            Apple      (AAPL), and            Mastercard      (MA). While the ETF is down 22% in 2020, the strategy behind it has returned an average of 8% a year from its 2014 inception through March 25, versus 6.2% for the Russell 1000.The            iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF      also takes a more nuanced approach, such as targeting the least-volatile stocks within their respective sectors and looking at exposures of the overall portfolio. The fund was down nearly 1% for the week through March 25, while its peer group and the benchmark were up—though it is still ahead of 86% of its peers this year. Many active funds in this sphere blend quantitative and fundamental research. The        BMO Low Volatility Equity      fund (BLVAX) ranks within the top decile of its Morningstar large-value peer group for every major trailing time period through five years. While the fund has fared better than the market and peers in the past month, it hasn’t forgone upside. In 2019, it returned 24%, lagging behind its category average by less than a percentage point. Recent top holdings include            Costco Wholesale      (COST) and gold miner            Newmont      (NEM). MFS Low Volatility Equity      (MLVAX), which launched in 2013, avoids the most-volatile stocks. The managers combine quantitative and fundamental research to see which companies are likely to weather current swings.Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity      fund (FULVX) launched last November, but success in similar strategies suggests that it can deliver. The fund combines fundamental stock selection with quantitative portfolio-construction techniques, with the goal of reducing absolute portfolio risk to outperform over a full market cycle. While it is down 23% in 2020, it still has an edge on its large-blend peers.

1,"Coronavirus will hurt sales at two major credit-card companies—            Visa      and            Mastercard      —more than the companies currently expect, according to Piper Sandler. In recent weeks, both Mastercard (icker: MA) and Visa (V) reduced their March-quarter sales-growth forecasts by a few percentage points. Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat sees more downside. On Thursday, he reaffirmed his Neutral ratings for both companies, but lowered his Mastercard stock-price target to $292 from $332. Donat cut his Visa stock target to $197 from $204.“We now expect COVID-19 to have a more negative impact,” he wrote. “We now think that the revised outlooks for both companies are overly optimistic…However, with the virus spreading to Europe and North America, we now expect impacts not just on cross-border activity but also on domestic spending activity.”Visa shares were down 5.6% to $163.23 on Thursday, while Mastercard stock was down 6.7% to $251.62. Neither company immediately responded to a request for comment on the analyst report.The analyst said the current difficult market environment will also lower the valuation multiples investors are willing pay for the credit-card companies. “While we believe that the card networks deserve a significant market premium, we think that the introduction of intra-quarter revenue volatility could reduce their P/E multiples,” he wrote, referring to the ratio of stock prices to earnings.

1,"Stocks tumbled Tuesday amid continuous fears over the spreading coronavirus outside of China, with a rate cut offering little to no support.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      dropped 785.91 points, or 2.94%, to close at 25,917.41. The        S&P 500      lost 86.86 points, or 2.81%, to end at 3003.37, and the        Nasdaq Composite      tumbled 268.08 points, or 2.99%, to close at 8684.09.Responding to Covid-19’s perceived economic impact, the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by half point to a range between 1.00% and 1.25% on Tuesday morning. At the following press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is in active contact with other central banks and there might be more formal coordination moving forward.This is the first rate cut outside a scheduled meeting since October 2008, and the vote was unanimous. After a brief respite, all three major stock indexes closed in the red as investors doubt that the central bank can really curb the coronavirus’ damage by loosening monetary policy. Some on Wall Street think the cut indicated that the Fed sees a credible danger of a possible credit crisis for small and midsized businesses–and consequently, a recession.Following the rate cut, gold futures jumped more than 3% and U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply to record lows as investors moved out of stocks and into haven assets. The two-year Treasury yields dropped 10.1 basis points to settle at 0.723%, 10-year yields slipped 8 basis points to 1.005%, and 30-year bond yields slid 2.2 basis points to 1.622%. The 10-year yields even briefly dropped below 1% for the first time ever. Companies continued to cut guidance, citing coronavirus impact. Following rivalMastercard      (MA), credit-card giant            Visa      (V) cut its forecast for net revenue growth in the March-ended quarter by 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points from the initial projection, citing a sharp slowdown in its cross-border business, in particular, travel-related spending. The company said it does not believe this deteriorating trend has bottomed out yet. Chip makers            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) also joined other tech companies to cut revenue guidance.Investors are also nervously watching the results from Democratic primary ballots in 14 states and one U.S. territory. Super Tuesday has typically been a strong indicator of the likely eventual nominee for the presidential election in November. More than one third of pledged delegates are up for grabs, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading candidates in the race, and others try to nab votes.

All three major U.S. stock indexes rebounded over 4% on Monday as investors hoped global central banks would provide support if needed and bargain hunters swooped into the market. But the market still has far to go before it can recoup last week’s steep losses.High-quality stocks with stable earnings and low exposure to the coronavirus outbreak could be a safer place to hide and a good bet for the early phases of a market rebound, Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a Sunday note.The list includes            Mastercard      (MA),            Visa      (V), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) in tech,            Boston Scientific      (BSX),            Humana      (HUM), and            Biogen      (BIIB) in health care,            Home Depot      (HD),            Lowe’s      (LOW), and            TJX      (TJX) in consumer discretionary, as well as            Costco Wholesale      (COST) and            Kroger      (KR) in consumer staples.

0,"While stocks continued a volatile stretch on Wednesday as investors digest daily coronavirus case numbers from authorities around the world, analysts have begun to game out the potential longer-term impact of the potential pandemic.Here’s a new take. The wider the spread and impact of the virus, the greater the chances of a presidential victory by Sen. Bernie Sanders. That’s according to Stifel’s head of institutional equity strategy, Barry Bannister.“The market reaction to 2020 recession risk is complicated by political risk, because if the 2020 U.S. presidential election ends up as ‘Trump vs. Sanders,’ a backlash victory (amid a possible U.S. recession) by the latter may have longer term adverse consequences for long duration capital via populist reflationary policies and near term headwinds via other executive actions,” Bannister wrote.He notes that it’s much too early to say whether the new form of coronavirus—referred to as Covid-19—fades away or grows into a global disaster. Meanwhile, the associated uncertainty is a cause for concern. The        S&P 500      closed lower on Wednesday, marking its fifth consecutive trading session in the red.That is particularly true for stocks of companies in cyclical sectors like industrials or energy. Factory closures, supply-chain disruptions, and travel cancellations are all negatives for the group—including in the U.S. Several major companies including            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Mastercard      (MA), and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) have already warned that they’ll be unable to meet prior financial guidance due to Covid-19. Corporate earnings will be hit, but the broader economy can still survive a quarter or two of that.The CDC said on Tuesday that it’s more of a matter of when, than if, the virus spreads more widely in the U.S. Should that lead to disruptive measures taken to limit its transmission, such as closing shopping areas or cancelling public events, it’s hard to imagine the U.S. economy escaping a recession as consumers limit their spending.That leads Bannister to favor stocks of defensive companies like consumer staples or utilities for the near term. Whether the economy is up, down, or sideways, people still need electricity and toilet paper.If the worst case happens, with a recession and a surge in unemployment as the November presidential election approaches, Bannister says, Sanders’s populist message could gain greater traction among the electorate. If a Sanders presidency brought much more federal spending without an equivalent increase in taxes, there could be implications for the Federal Reserve—on top of any moves it would make to counteract a recession.“First ‘past the post’ with the ‘free stuff’ may win the hearts and minds of voters (and control of the Fed),” Bannister wrote. “...A risk is Modern Monetary Theory laws that force the Fed to monetize debt (eroding Fed independence, weakening the dollar).”A weaker dollar would be bullish for commodities, which are generally priced in greenbacks in global markets. The faster inflation that higher inflation that fiscal and monetary-policy stimulus would bring favors value stocks, with more near-term cash flows, over growth stocks, which are expected to earn a greater share of their forecastable cash flows years into the future. Discounted to the present, those cash flows are worth less today with a higher inflation rate.The combined fiscal and monetary stimulus could quickly send stocks climbing again. “The upside of recession fear is possible assistance in the form of monetary policy (potentially for the U.S.) and combined monetary and fiscal (abroad, some ongoing), leading to possible ‘V’ shaped market in 2020,” Bannister wrote.That’s one analyst’s thought exercise on Wednesday. No one can accurately predict at this point how the coronavirus epidemic will develop—but the range of possible outcomes is certainly wide.

All Rights Reserved11:20 a.m.: U.S. stock indexes are solidly in the green as bargain hunters swoop in after two days of steep losses. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      has gained 1.5%, or 412 points, while the        S&P 500       added a similar amount. The        Nasdaq Composite      jumped 1.8%.The Wednesday gains come after all three indexes posted their largest two-day point losses ever to start the week. The selloff was spurred by fears over the sudden uptick in cases of the new form of coronavirus revealed over the weekend. Referred to as Covid-19, it appears to be spreading faster and in more countries beyond China, where it emerged last month. On Tuesday, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that they expect the virus to infect more people in the U.S.The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq each fell more than 6% through Monday and Tuesday, wiping out their 2020 gains and more. The number of new cases in China fell on Wednesday, but more continued to be reported elsewhere, including in Italy, South Korea, and Iran. Still, at least some investors were ready to go shopping for stocks available at a sharp discount to prices seen last week.In a mirror image to the prior two days, the buying was broad on Wednesday. All 11 S&P 500 sectors were in the green and 28 of the Dow’s 30 stocks were up.Technology stocks led the market higher, particularly semiconductor companies such as            Nvidia      (ticker: NVDA), which was up 4.7%. The group as a whole was up 2.4%. Gold was down 0.7%, after a strong start to the week, and U.S. Treasury prices fell slightly after yields on some notes hit record lows on Tuesday. Even oil got a bit of a bounce, up 0.3%. We’re still far from erasing the start of the week’s turbulence, but it shows some investors are ready to take on a bit more risk again.Beyond the human cost of the virus’s spread, investors and analysts worry about the economic impact of authorities’ measures to control the disease. Supply-chain disruptions due to closed factories and falling demand for travel and other forms of consumption threaten to tip a fragile global economy into recession if they last for several months. Major companies including            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Mastercard      (MA), and            United Airlines Holdings      (UAL) have each warned that they’ll be unable to meet prior financial guidance due to Covid-19.There is plenty to keep markets volatile in coming days as investors watch daily updates on virus cases in China, Italy, South Korea, Iran, and elsewhere.

It comes after            Mastercard      (MA) cut its revenue outlook earlier this week and U.S. software giant            HP Inc.      (HPQ) factored in an 8% hit to its earnings per share for the second quarter, following            Apple’s      (AAPL) second-quarter guidance warning last week.Diageo (DEO)—the British drinks company, whose brands include Johnnie Walker and Guinness—said on Wednesday sales had been hurt by the closure of bars and restaurants in China along with the postponement of events and fall in tourism across Asia.It estimated that organic net sales in 2020 would be £225 million to £325 million lower as a result but that still depended on the “timing and pace of recovery,” while operating profit would be £140 million to £200 million lower.The company, like many others, said it was unable to “quantify the impact” at its interim results at the end of January.Since then the virus has spread outside of China, across Asia and into Europe. More than 81,000 people have been infected world-wide and the death toll has risen above 2,750.Danone, the world’s largest yogurt maker and Evian water owner, lowered sales and profit margin forecasts for the year on Wednesday. First-quarter sales would be affected by losses in its water business in China, it said, and full-year sales growth would be 2-4% compared with previous guidance of 4-5%. Mining company            Rio Tinto      (RIO) said on Wednesday it was still evaluating the impact of the virus but that full-year guidance remained unchanged. It said the outbreak could create “significant uncertainty” in the short term.Airline stocks have been among the worst affected by the global selloff, as travel restrictions have left aircraft grounded. Deutsche Lufthansa      (LHA.Germany) announced a hiring freeze and said it was offering staff unpaid leave due to the outbreak. It also said it would cut costs and expenses and cancel some projects.Air France-KLM      (AF.France) said last week it could suffer a €200 million hit to earnings in 2020, while            Qantas Airways      (QAN.Australia) warned of a 150 million Australian dollars impact to earnings.

He says any investors tempted to buy stocks right now should keep an eye on a key technical level on the S&P. “If we see price head through 3200, then it will lead to even higher volatility and risk of a 10% drawdown.

Barron’s reported in December that the business, which produces $30 million a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was up for sale. The company was expected to sell for 20 times Ebitda, Barron’s said in December. Raymond James was advising on the auction. Amy Porter founded AffiniPay in 2005. The Austin, Texas, company provides payments technology for specific industries such as law and accounting. It processes more than $6 billion annually for more than 60,000 users, including the Alabama State Bar, the Louisiana State Bar and the ASPCA. In June, Porter, who was AffiniPay’s CEO, became executive chairman. Tom West took over as CEO, a statement said at the time.Payments companies, which typically process transactions between merchants and customers, have emerged as one of the hottest sectors in financial technology. Last year saw several large payments transactions:            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) bought TSYS for $21.5 billion,            Fiserv      (FISV) acquired First Data for $22 billion, and            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) snapped up WorldPay in a $35 billion deal.            Mastercard      (MA) bought Nets for $3.19 billion in August.More recently,            Visa      (V) agreed in January to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion.

The private-equity firm acquired BluePay, a payment processor for merchants, in 2013. Four years later, in 2017, it sold BluePay to First Data for $760 million. TA also invested in BillDesk, an Indian payments company, in 2012, and in Financial Information Technologies, which provides invoicing and electronic payments to alcoholic beverage retailers and distributors, in 2018. Last year, TA’s 13th flagship fund raised $8.5 billion. Great Hill, which sold its stake in AffiniPay, invested in the company in 2015.

0,"Investing in quality growth companies is a pretty basic concept: Stay hyperfocused on entities with good balance sheets, healthy free cash flow, and high and stable returns on equity. Like eating well and exercising, success is the product of consistency and discipline. “Investing is often seen as some effort to uncover something magical,” says Matt Benkendorf, the chief investment officer of Vontobel Quality Growth and co-manager of the $368 million        Virtus Vontobel Global Opportunities      fund (ticker: NWWOX). “We look for what’s already there in front of our faces, and then see if we can understand why it’s there and if it can continue.”Benkendorf, 42, has been honing that practice his entire career. He started straight out of college in 1999 in the back office at Vontobel Quality Growth, a $35 billion boutique arm of Vontobel Asset Management. He worked his way onto the trading desk, then into analyst and portfolio-manager positions. In late 2008, Benkendorf joined Rajiv Jain as co-manager of the global fund, which has returned an average of 12.5% a year over the past decade, better than 93% of its world large-stock peers.When Jain left Vontobel in 2016 to start his own firm, Benkendorf promoted Hong Kong–based analyst Ramiz Chelat, 44, to join him at the helm. Over the past three years, the duo have navigated the fund to an average annual return of 15.2%, clearing its benchmark, the MSCI ACWI, and the category average by nearly four percentage points. The global fund, whose A shares carry a 5.75% load, is a highly concentrated “all star” portfolio that brings together ideas from regional strategies managed by the 21-person quality growth team. But they don’t just pick out top holdings from sibling funds—they look for the best companies in their sectors, regardless of where they are in the world, and make sure they work well together in a single portfolio. “You can’t have a basketball team that’s all centers,” says Benkendorf. As CIO, Benkendorf also makes sure his team works well together. He and the four analysts who work with him in Vontobel’s Fort Lauderdale, Fla., office typically start their day just as Chelat and his two Hong Kong colleagues are winding down. The rest of the team works out of Vontobel’s U.S. headquarters in New York, and everyone meets up on weekly video calls. The fund has a lot of leeway on country weightings, which can be 20 percentage points above or below that of the benchmark. Roughly half of the global fund’s holdings are based in the U.S. The reason? “It’s such a ripe playing field for quality businesses,” Benkendorf says. Still, most of the global fund’s roughly 50 holdings come into the portfolio after they make the cut for one of the regional portfolios. The team starts by screening respective regions for companies that score high on quality factors. The most promising names get handed over to sector analysts, who arrive at five-year growth and valuation targets. In the case of true quality growth companies, those numbers should move in sync year after year. The success of these companies isn’t predicated on a major turnaround, technology breakthrough, or management makeover. “We want businesses that have a clean track record executing their current strategy,” says Benkendorf, whose team includes three former investigative journalists who research governance, accounting, hiring practices, and anything else that might upend an investment thesis. Two companies that typify this approach are            Visa      (V) and            Mastercard      (MA), global payments juggernauts that collectively account for about 45% of global card-payment volume (excluding China, that number is 90%). The companies’ financials only get better as they get bigger.Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA) is another example of how a business’s growth can snowball. The team first bought shares in one of its regional strategies when the e-commerce company went public in 2014. They added Alibaba to the Global Opportunities fund in 2016, when concerns over the company’s transition from a PC-based platform to a mobile offering opened a door to buy shares around $60. Alibaba is now trading around $220. Since its New York initial public offering, the company has added more merchants, now at 11 million, to its platform, and nearly tripled its user base to 700 million.While the market is closely watching how the coronavirus affects its earnings, Chelat doesn’t think the impact will be long-lasting. “E-commerce is one category that can do fairly well because people are consuming more in homes,” he says. Note: Holdings as of Jan. 31. Returns through Feb 17; five- and 10-year returns are annualized.Sources: Morningstar; Virtus Investment PartnersA company can be high-quality in the eyes of the Vontobel team even when the market thinks otherwise. A case in point is            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ), which has been sitting under a cloud of class-action lawsuits related to its talcum powder—in addition to opioid-related litigation. Plaintiffs in the talcum cases claim the company knew its products were contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos, while the company has denied those allegations and has said there is no asbestos in its baby powder. The fund bought the stock in 2018.Baby powder is only a sliver of J&J’s revenue. The team thinks the company’s free cash flow could exceed $20 billion this year, which is more than their conservative estimate of up to $7 billion for all outstanding talc-related legal costs. And J&J, along with the fund’s top holding,            Microsoft      (MSFT), are the only two U.S. companies with AAA credit ratings.Bookmaker Flutter Entertainment (FLTR.UK), might also seem at odds with a quality-growth philosophy, but Benkendorf begs to differ. “It’s a phenomenal business that’s growing its bottom line in the double digits,” he says. The team added Flutter’s Dublin-based predecessor Paddy Power to the global fund in 2012; the company merged with British competitor Betfair in 2016 and later rebranded as Flutter. Online sports betting has long been legal in many countries, including Australia and in the United Kingdom, and it’s gaining traction in the U.S., where it’s legal in 20 states. Online gambling offers enormous returns on invested capital because it requires very little net fixed assets—and the business model is durable, to say the least. “Gambling is one of the world’s oldest businesses,” Benkendorf says. “It feeds into human nature, which is pretty predictable.”  Corrections & amplifications:  The co-managers of Virtus Vontobel Global Opportunities estimate that Johnson & Johnson could have up to $7 billion in all outstanding talc-related legal costs. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that all outstanding talc-related legal costs could be up to $18 billion. Alibaba has around 11 million merchants. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said it had 11 billion.

1," 3:04 p.m. With one hour left in the day, a quick glance at the 10 worst stocks in the        S&P 500      show a consistent theme—investors are scared of semiconductor stocks. They’re not terribly fond of garbage, either.Of the 10 worst stocks in the S&P 500 at 3:04 p.m., seven of them are semiconductor stocks. That’s no surprise following            Texas Instruments      ’ (TXN) disappointing earnings, which appears to have rekindled worries that the chip market hadn’t bottomed yet. That explains the presence of            Analog Devices      (ADI),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM),            Applied Materials      (AMAT),            Western Digital      (WDC), and            Broadcom      (AVGO).That leaves three non-chip stocks to round out 10-worst performers, and each had their own reasons for dropping. There’s            Chipotle Mexican Grill       (CMG), which beat earnings but perhaps not by enough to warrant an 85%-plus gained in 2019.            Waste Management      (WM), meanwhile, beat earnings again—it’s missed just once in the last four years—whether it rises or falls is something of a coinflip. Finally,            Nike      (NKE) fell 2.9% after announcing its CEO succession plans.1. Texas Instruments -7.6% to $118.83  2. Chipotle Mexican Grill -4.6% to $792.98  3. Analog Devices -4.4% to $106  4. Microchip Technology -3.4% to $93.12  5. Waste Management -3% to $113.37  6. Maxim Integrated Products -3% to $56.88  7. Nike -2.9% to $92.83  8. Applied Materials -2.9% to $50.49  9. Western Digital -2.8% to $57.22  10.

0,"Semiconductor stocks, including            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), have been soaring this year. But has the group come too far too fast?   Bay Crest Partners technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky thinks so. There’s little doubt that semiconductor stocks have had a spectacular 2019. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX) has gained 40% so far this year, while the        VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF      (SMH), the most heavily traded semiconductor ETF, has climbed 41%. The        SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF      (XSD) has rallied 45%. The        S&P 500      has gained 20% in 2019. Krinsky, being a technical analyst, doesn’t have a problem with the semiconductor stocks per se—he’s still a fan of            Marvell Technology Group      (MRVL),            Cirrus Logic      (CRUS), and            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM)—but he is worried about how far the group has come. One way to judge that is to look at where a stock or index trades relative to its 50-day moving average. After gaining 40% in 2019, the        PHLX Semiconductor Index      now sits nearly 14% above that moving average, the most since the stock market bottomed in 2009. That doesn’t mean semiconductor stocks are headed for a fall, but it does mean that they could be ready for a pause. “At a minimum, we are likely to see some consolidation from here in the overall index, even if they ultimately push higher,” Krinsky writes. “Tactically its perhaps not the best time to pile in.”As for Marvell, Cirrus, and Maxim? “We would not be surprised to see better entry points than here and now,” Krinsky writes.

0,"The            Cypress Semiconductor      rally continued on Thursday following a Bloomberg report that the company has hired advisors to weigh strategic alternatives after it was contacted by a potential buyer. Cypress has declined to comment. Morgan Stanley semiconductor analyst Craig Hettenbach this morning backed away from his bearish call on the stock, raising his rating to Equal Weight from Underweight and lifting his price target to $15.50 from $11.50. He remains concerned that cyclical pressures could lead to downward pressure on second-half earnings estimates for both Cypress (ticker: CY) in particular and semiconductors in general—but he adds that “the stock could receive support from potential strategic value,” given other recent merger-and-acquisitions activity in the sector.Hettenbach uses a sum-of-the-parts approach to Cypress, a maker of microcontrollers and memory chips, to reach his $15.50 price target, but adds that his bull-case valuation of $21 “ascribes higher multiples” to various pieces of the business “in the context of strategic value.” He cautions that there remains a “challenging M&A regulatory environment” that could be a headwind to any potential deal that requires approval from Chinese regulators. But he also notes that M&A activity in the sector has picked up lately, citing the pending $1.07 billion acquisition by            ON Semiconductor      (ON) for          Quantenna Communications      (QNTA) and Wednesday’s announcement that            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI) is buying            Marvell Technology Group’s      (MRVL) connectivity business for $1.76 billion. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Stein also weighed in on the Cypress situation this morning, but he takes a skeptical view, keeping his Hold rating and a $17 target price on the stock. He estimates in a research note that Cypress could be worth $19 a share in an acquisition, “not offering enough upside to justify the M&A speculation.” Stein runs through a list of potential buyers, but then dismisses most of them as not quite right. Here’s the short version:NXP: Unlikely, given the Marvell deal.Infineon Technologies      (IFX.Germany): European buyer could create regulatory issues.STMicroelectronics      (STM): M&A not a priority for ST.Texas Instruments      (TXN): Unlikely to buy a microcontroller company.Microchip Technology      (MCHP): Might have interest, but could already be too leveraged.Renesas Electronics      (6723.Japan): Recently bought Integrated Device Technology; likely limited bandwidth for nowAnalog Devices      (ADI): He sees it bulking up, but doesn’t see Cypress as the right fit.Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM): Says a “less than stellar track record” on M&A makes this an unlikely deal.Others: “At our last count there were over 100 publicly traded semiconductor companies, so we could be overlooking a potential buyer with a strong fit, however, the above list seems like a representative sample and it is not popping with good fits in our view.” As noted in an earlier post, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland told Barron’s in an interview that he thinks Cypress could be worth as much as $25 a share in a takeover.After rallying $1.86, or 12%, to $17.25 on Wednesday, Cypress stock on Thursday has gained another 41 cents, or 2.4%, to $17.66, just about a dollar shy of the stock’s 52-week high of $18.59.

All Rights ReservedCypress Semiconductor      could be worth as much as $25 a share in a takeover, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in an interview Wednesday. That would be 44% upside from the stock’s latest close.On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the chip maker is “exploring strategic options,” including a potential sale, after “receiving takeover interest.” The story, which was attributed to “people familiar with the matter,” said that Cypress (ticker: CY) has engaged with unspecified advisors on the situation. A Cypress spokesman on Wednesday told Barron’s that the company does not comment on rumors and speculation.Cypress shares rallied 12%, to $17.25 on the news Wednesday—on a down day for the        S&P 500.      At $25, Cypress would be worth a little over $9 billion.Rolland notes that the company’s new focus on producing components for both automotive and internet of things applications could make the company attractive to a variety of potential buyers, such as            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM), ON Semiconductor (ON),            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI), and            Qualcomm      (QCOM).Rolland, who has a “Positive” rating and a $20 price target on Cypress shares, notes that the stock’s forward P/E multiple is actually a little below that of the average semiconductor maker. He adds that he sees considerable synergies available to a potential buyer that could lift profits at Cypress by about 50% to around $1.50 a share. Apply a 17x multiple to that forecast, he adds, and the stock could be worth about $25. As noted in yesterday’s Barron’s story, Cypress executives are scheduled to speak Thursday morning at the Cowen & Co. technology conference in New York. Another factor to watch is the status of the company’s relationship with its founder and former CEO, TJ Rodgers. In 2017, Cypress settled a proxy fight with Rodgers but the standstill agreement between the two sides expires on Friday. Rodgers could not immediately be reached for comment.

1,"Investors concerned about the big swoon for tech stocks at the end of last year received welcome news this week.Three large semiconductor companies announced earnings beats after the market closed Wednesday, a welcome respite from the barrage of poor forecasts and plunging stock prices for chip companies in the last round of quarterly results.            Texas Instruments      (ticker: TXN), which was the canary in the coal mine for last quarter’s miserable earnings season, beat on earnings, as did            Lam Research      (LRCX) after installing a new CEO, and            Xilinx      (XLNX). Xilinx stock rose more than 8% in after-hours trading, Lam’s gains topped 4%, and Texas Instruments’ stock was up 1.5%.Those earnings beats helped other chip companies in late trading, especially Lam’s major competitors in supplying the equipment used to make semiconductors,            Applied Materials      (AMAT) and            KLA-Tencor      (KLAC), which were both up more than 3% in after-hours action. Chip makers            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Analog Devices      (ADI) and            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM) were up more than 1% in late trading. Earlier Wednesday,            ASML Holding      (ASML) topped revenue and earnings estimates and closed with a 1.6% gain, though Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini said that the earnings beat was driven by a change in the company’s tax rate.In other earnings action Wednesday afternoon:•            Ford Motor      (F) revealed a loss to end the year — not a huge surprise after an earlier pre-announcement — and did not disclose its forecast for 2019. Read: Why Ford and General Motors Stock Deserve More Respect •            Citrix Systems      (CTXS) shares fell more than 6% in the extended session after the company forecast a weaker-than-expected start to the new year.•            Raymond James Financial      (RJF) earnings doubled from a year ago thanks to a lower tax bill.

Synchrony also confirmed that it was selling its Walmart loan portfolio to            Capital One Financial      (COF) (which announced earnings Tuesday).Synchrony shares rose 10.7% Wednesday, the best single-day gain in the company’s history.• Two        Dow Jones Industrial Average      components saw their shares zoom higher after earnings Wednesday.            United Technologies      (UTX) easily beat earnings and revenue expectations, and Chief Executive Greg Hayes expects the company’s segment profit to grow faster than sales for the year ahead, as the company prepares to split itself into three businesses.            Procter & Gamble      (PG) also reported better-than-expected results in its fiscal second-quarter report, though Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan will be looking for more information about why the company didn’t lift its full-year earnings forecast despite beating estimates in the first half of the fiscal year.• Shares of            Abbott Laboratories      (ABT) fell 2.2% Wednesday after the company reported a revenue miss.•            Kimberly-Clark      (KMB) announced a new strategic plan ahead of its 150-year anniversary in 2022, but investors focused on the company’s earnings and revenue misses.•            Comcast      (CMCSA) said it lost 29,000 net video customers in the fourth quarter, though the telecommunications stock jumped 5.5% Wednesday after the company posted revenue and earnings beats. MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett pointed out that even though the number of video subscribers is falling, Comcast exceeded expectations on the metric, and investors seem to have shifted their focus to the company’s broadband business.

1,"Semiconductors have had it tough in the past year, but JPMorgan argues that the worst may be over for the group.Where we were: The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX) is down some 13.5% in the past 12 months, compared to just a 5.6% decline for the        Technology Select Sector SPDR      (XLK) in the same period. Where we’re headed: Estimates may come down a bit further, but overall downside looks limited from here, says JPMorgan. Looking back, 2018 was the year that chip makers got crunched. Last year wasn’t a great year for stocks, and in the second half of the year, tech felt the pinch, after a string of high-profile missteps and increasing risk-aversion. Semiconductors, however, were hit harder than most. U.S.-China tensions ignited worries about supply chains, lackluster smartphone and auto sales pointed to lower end-market demand, inventories bloated, and even bitcoin declines meant less cryptocurrency mining. So, it’s fair to say that hopes aren’t high as we go into the fourth-quarter reporting season. Yet JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur argues that, while there are still problems to shake out in the sector, semiconductors may at least be close to bottoming. Sur thinks that most companies will report fourth-quarter earnings in line with expectations, and provide below-seasonal consensus for the first quarter of this year, due to the ongoing worries listed above. And here comes the painful part: He anticipates that we’ll see “another round of consensus estimate cuts in the January earnings season on anticipation of sub-seasonal demand trends in the first quarter.”Yet that’s actually not so bad, Sur notes, given that appears to already be discounting a significant slowdown in demand. Not to mention that there are still bright spots, like gaming, high-end computing, aerospace and defense, and cloud data center networking that haven’t slowed like other end markets. In addition, many stocks are down about 25% from their 2018 peaks, which nearly mirrors the “entire peak-to-trough declines of the last three down cycles,” he writes. That means that if history is any guide, there’s limited further downside in the names today, even with more estimate cuts to come. He also anticipates that at some point later this quarter or next, the stocks should start to reflect improving fundamentals, and he advises investors to starting buying any further pullbacks in the sector. As for specific stocks,            Broadcom      (AVGO) is Sur’s favorite large-cap pick, although he also has Overweight ratings on            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Intel      (INTC),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM), and            Micron Technology      (MU).

1,"The worst of the chip downturn isn’t over for            Western Digital      (ticker: WDC), according to Evercore ISI.The firm’s analyst C.J. Muse lowered his rating for Western Digital stock to Underperform from In Line, predicting pricing for its storage devices will keep falling.“While greater NAND weakness is well known in the marketplace, we believe the market doesn’t fully appreciate the negative consequences to Western Digital and its structural competitive issues,” he wrote Monday. NAND is flash memory, which is used in smartphones and solid-state drives.The company’s stock fell 4.9% Monday to $38.06. Its shares have fallen more than 50% in the past 12 months as Western Digital suffered from the semiconductor downturn. Muse lowered his price target for Western Digital stock to $30 from $35.Western Digital didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.In October, the company significantly lowered its guidance for the December quarter, citing weakening demand for its products.Muse predicts falling NAND flash memory prices will drive a 22% year-over-year decline for the company’s flash products’ sales in the first half of 2019, versus the Wall Street consensus of an 8% drop.“We see the stock trading lower on the hard catalyst of numbers and guidance coming down, with the realization that the valuation floor is not as secure as previously thought,” he wrote.In similar fashion,            Morgan Stanley      on Monday lowered its price targets for            Cypress Semiconductor      (CY),            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI), and            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM), citing worsening conditions in markets for goods that use semiconductors.

Last August, the firm downgraded its rating on the semiconductor industry to “cautious” from “in-line,” citing increasing inventories of chips. The firm says it is still cautious about the sector.“Our concern is that end demand could still be getting worse and most of the stocks don’t have valuation support,” he wrote. Hettenbach noted that year-over-year monthly declines for auto sales in China worsened through the end of 2018. He also cited a deterioration in global industrial manufacturing surveys and figures indicating weak sales in the smartphone sector.He reduced his price target for Cypress to $11.50 from $12, lowered his forecast for NXP to $95 from $100 and reduced his target for Maxim to $51 from $53. In midafternoon, Cypress was at $13.05, down 1.7%’ NXP was off 0.5% at $79.05, and Maxim had fallen 2.8% to $51.37. He has a Equal-weight ratings for Maxim and NXP shares.

0,"A recent dip in shares of            Nvidia      —the chip maker’s stock is down by double digits since the start of the month—is a great buying opportunity, according to            Goldman Sachs.The firm reiterated its Buy rating and added the shares to its “conviction list,” saying Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) is shielded from a likely semiconductor down-cycle due to company-specific tailwinds.Nvidia shares have declined about 15% since Oct. 1, while the            iShares PHLX Semiconductor      ETF (SOXX), which tracks a widely followed chip index, has fallen about 7%. Investors have been increasingly worried about the chip sector’s fundamentals in recent weeks.“We expect idiosyncratic growth drivers such as its product cycle in gaming and potential share gains in data center and professional visualization to contribute to earnings and stock price outperformance,” Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari wrote on Thursday. “We recommend investors to own/buy the stock at current levels with our long-term thesis intact.”Nvidia stock was up slightly in early trading on Thursday after the note. Hari lowered his price target to $305 from $324, but that still represents upside of about 25% relative to the stock’s current level.The analyst said he is optimistic over the company’s recent launch of next-generation gaming graphics cards based on its “Turing” architecture. He expects that Nvidia will launch cheaper cards based on the new technology in its next fiscal year, which could lead to higher sales growth.Goldman has reduced its expectations about the gaming business for the near term, but it is still upbeat about the outlook for the medium to long term. More people are playing videogames, and chip prices will rise as the newest games demand better equipment, Hari wrote. Nvidia is slated to report its results for the fiscal third quarter on Nov. 15.Hari is skeptical about many of Nvidia’s industry peers. In the same report, he lowered his ratings to Sell from Neutral for both            Analog Devices      (ADI) and            Maxim Integrated      (MXIM).

0,"There is likely to be more pain ahead for chip stocks even after a 28% drop from their summer highs. Chip analysts at Morgan Stanley think the sector will struggle due to elevated inventories and excessive orders from semiconductor distributors. A similar dynamic caused the industry to drop 30% from peak to trough in 2015, but this time could be worse. ON Semiconductor      (ON) and            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI) are down nearly 40% since the summer. “The biggest difference in semi fundamentals today versus the last correction seen in 2015 is in the degree of excess that built up in the supply chain this go-round,” Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach wrote to clients on Tuesday. “In 2018, cyclical indicators (lead times, double ordering, inventory) flashed red in contrast to the benign cyclical backdrop of 2015.”Hettenbach doesn’t cover            Intel      (INTC) or            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD),      which aren’t dealing with the same inventory issues.Morgan Stanley was one of the first major Wall Street banks to turn negative on the sector.

The ETF rose 1.2% Tuesday, despite Hettenbach’s latest note. That’s a bit of a surprise given that Hettenbach’s bearish views have thus far been vindicated. “Any trading bounces will probably offer better opportunities to further reduce exposure,” wrote Hettenbach, who’s leading a growing group of skeptics. In a similar move, KeyBanc Capital Markets also warned clients on Monday that certain semiconductor stocks with “broad-based” auto and industrial exposure such as            Analog Devices      (ADI),            Maxim Integrated      (MXIM), and            Texas Instruments      (TXN) could face a difficult earnings season.There is likely to be more pain ahead for chip stocks even after a 28% drop from their summer highs.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"On Tuesday, the 10-year Treasury yield topped 3% for the first time in four years. Throughout the day, that served as something of a Rorschach test for investors, open to wide interpretation. To some, it was a sign the economy is pulling out of a long trudge. To others, it reflected concern over ballooning deficits. The stock market, for its part, held steady until just before lunchtime in New York, and then began to slide, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index ending the day down 1.3%. The best-performing sectors were ones that usually do poorly when bond yields rise: utilities and telecoms.For the macroeconomically conflicted—or confused—below are three cheap stocks with ample and fast-growing dividends. If the economy slows and higher bond yields prove fleeting, investors will be glad to have healthy dividend payments coming in. If the economy roars and bond yields shoot higher, the dividend increases could help these stocks hold their appeal. The “cheap” part is mostly a happy byproduct of the dividends. Goldman Sachs tracks stock indexes based on certain factors, including four that deal with how companies spend their cash. There’s an index of companies that buy back lots of stock; one of companies that spend on capital investments and research; one of companies that spread spending between buybacks and dividends; and one of dividend-growers. The dividend-growers are the cheapest of the four indexes, recently trading at 13.3 times earnings, versus 16.8 times for the S&P 500. Last year, the dividend-growers beat the S&P 500 by four percentage points. The median company in the index yields 3% and is expected to grow its payments by 12% a year, on average, through next year. Here are the three stocks:•            KeyCorp      (KEY) faces the same challenge as its banking peers. It borrows from savers at short-term rates and lends to borrowers at long-term ones. Short rates have risen faster than long ones, which crimps lending margins. But Key has growth potential stemming from its purchase of First Niagara Financial Group, completed in 2016. The deal continues to provide opportunities to cut costs and cross-sell Key products to a million new customers. Earnings per share for Key are expected to rise 25% this year and 10% next year. Shares trade at 12 times earnings and yield 2.1%, based on a dividend rate of 42 cents a share per year. Analysts expect payments to jump to 78 cents a share by 2020. • Chipmaker            Broadcom      (AVGO) was blocked by the Trump administration from purchasing            Qualcomm      (QCOM), which leaves it likely to pursue smaller deals. In an April 4 research note initiating coverage of Broadcom with a Buy rating, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri pointed to            Mellanox Technologies      (MLNX),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM), and            Xilinx      (XLNX) as likely takeover candidates. He also noted that the shift to smaller deals would allow more cash to be returned to shareholders. Broadcom, trading at 12 times earnings, already has a 3.1% dividend yield, based on $7 a share per year in payments. Consensus estimates have those payments approaching $11 a share by Broadcom’s fiscal year ending October 2020. •            Gap      (GPS) is one of the least-loved names on Wall Street. Among 27 analysts who cover it, only two recommend a purchase of shares. A report last week by Morgan Stanley helps explain why. It notes that            Amazon.com      (AMZN) gained more market share in clothing last year than it did the year before, mostly from department stores, and is on pace to become the market leader this year, passing            Walmart      (WMT). But Gap is one of a handful of retailers also gaining share. Barron’s recommended the stock last month (see “Old Navy Could Lift the Gap by 25%,” March 17, 2018). The company name gives investors the impression that its fortunes are riding on the success of Gap stores, but within two years, Old Navy could bring in three-quarters of earnings. It’s thriving for several reasons, but chief among them is that “fast fashion”—cheap garments and rapid fashion adjustments made possible by sophisticated supply chains—is doing well, and Old Navy is the only fast-fashion player with a focus on families as opposed to singles. Gap stock fetches 11 times earnings and yields 3.3%, after the company last month raised its payment 5%, to 97 cents a share per year. Analysts expect a similar increase next year.

1," Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM) is rising after hours, following a light first-quarter report, as its guidance beat analysts expectations. The chip maker said it earned 54 cents a share on revenue of $576 million in its first quarter. Analysts were looking for earnings of 56 cents a share on revenue of $576.8 million.However, for the second quarter, Maxim said it will earn between 61 cents and 67 cents a share, on revenue of $600 million to $640 million. Both top- and bottom line forecasts were better than the consensus expectations of 57 cents a share on revenue of $585.1 million.In July, Maxim fell after reporting disappointing fourth quarter sales and guidance.The shares ended up during regular trading and have gained almost 30% since the start of the year.Maxim initially rose more than 1% after the report, slipped, and now is higher again, up 1.8%.

All Rights Reserved MKM Partners We expect another round of solid results and forward guidance as the calendar-third-quarter earnings season kicks off this week.Our recent conversations with supply-chain participants indicate a strong finish to the quarter with feedback on the Industrial and Aerospace/Defense markets the most positive. PC demand trends appear stable while the wireless handset market in China appears to have improved modestly over the last several weeks.While the timing of Apple (ticker: AAPL) iPhone ramps, as well as demand across SKUs, remains uncertain, we believe that this dynamic is well understood. With the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) continuing to materially outperform the broader markets (up 35% year-to-date versus up 14.2% for the S&P 500 over the same time period), and with semiconductor valuations continuing to move higher, we remain biased towards product-cycle companies and those with content gain opportunities. To that end,            Broadcom      (AVGO) remains our top large-cap idea while Cavium (CAVM) remains our top mid-cap pick.Broadcom (October quarter) remains a top pick given the company’s positioning at Apple and with content growth ahead in the iPhone X. We think a shift to an all OLED line-up for 2018 would provide an additional catalyst to Broadcom shares. As well, we expect Broadcom’s Wired Infrastructure business segment to benefit from continued data-center growth, particularly given a new server cycle that will begin to ramp during the second half of this year.Cavium remains our top mid-cap idea as a multifaceted-product-cycle growth story with the potential for meaningful catalysts to revenue next year as we expect the company’s Arm Holdings-based server platform to ramp meaningfully. In the meantime, despite some improvement in recent weeks, Cavium shares have underperformed the SOX and S&P 500 indexes year-to-date (Cavium is up 11% year-to-date versus the SOX and S&P up 35% and 14%, respectively, over the same time period).We believe that investor skepticism around new product traction is likely a primary factor behind the underperformance. Cavium, though, continues to put up the numbers with reported revenue at or above the high-end of management guidance in almost every quarter going back to 2012, and we expect more of the same when the company reports September-quarter results.Broad-based semiconductor demand trends remain favorable. Our recent supply-chain discussion indicated that demand trends across broad-based semiconductor end-markets remained strong through the third quarter. Strength was particularly noted in the industrial and aerospace and defense end markets. We recently raised our estimates on            Xilinx      (XLNX) following these checks, and we expect solid results and outlooks from other companies within our coverage universe that have meaningful exposure to these markets such as such as            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM), On Semiconductor (ON) and            Silicon Laboratories      (SLAB). With valuations extending, within this group of names, we remain positive on On Semiconductor shares based on relative valuation. -- Ruben Roy  The opinions contained in Investors’ Soapbox in no way represent those of Barrons.com or Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1," JPMorgan  We remain positively biased on semiconductor stocks as third-quarter earnings season begins next week for our semiconductor universe.We anticipate most companies to report September results (revenues, margins, earnings per share) in line or above consensus estimates and provide a December quarter outlook that is in line with seasonal trends (flat-to-up 2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth) on margins that should continue to expand. Given the 34% year-to-date (YTD) appreciation of semiconductor stocks (about 14% appreciation since the July earnings season), it’s clear that market expectations are relatively well-aligned with the positive trajectory of the fundamental environment here in the second half of the year.Accordingly, we wouldn’t be surprised to see a near-term pullback (some profit-taking) or holding patterning in semi stocks, but we anticipate stocks at least holding their 30%-plus YTD gains through the end of this year. As the market gains more confidence that 2018 will be another growth year (up 3%-5%) and that supply-side metrics will continue to remain disciplined, we believe this will provide the next catalyst for semi stocks to move higher -- probably closer to the end of this year/beginning of next year.Overall, second-half demand trends are tracking to typical seasonality, with strength in consumer and compute (PCs, PC gaming, data center) and a normal seasonal (i.e., weaker) trajectory in industrial and automotive segments. We anticipate generally in-line second-half smartphone fundamentals with shipments more weighted to the fourth quarter due to the             Apple      (AAPL) iPhone X ramp timing, and we see continued strength in cloud data center demand. China optical (long haul/metro) fundamentals are likely to remain muted through the second half of this year as the provincial buildouts have yet to be signed off, but optical stocks have already discounted this, in our view.Memory fundamentals continue to remain strong with significant demand pull from cloud/data center amidst continued tight supply trends. For the full year, we believe semiconductor industry revenues will grow by about 16%-20% and above the long-term industry growth trend of 3%-7% year-over-year, following two years of below-average growth. Supply-side fundamentals remain relatively stable as original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distribution inventories remain at/below historical levels and component availability/lead times remain within typical norms, with a few exceptions (e.g.,            Microchip Technology      (ticker: MCHP)). Moreover, semiconductor-capital intensity remains well below historical peaks where downturns have occurred.For large-cap names, we focus on market leaders with strong margin/free cash flow (FCF) expansion potential, strong capital return programs and a focus on growth/diversified areas such as cloud data center, automotive and industrial. Our large-cap top picks are Overweight-rated            Broadcom      (AVGO),            Micron Technology      (MU),            Intel      (INTC),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM) and Microchip.In small-cap stocks, we favor market leaders with strong product cycles and the potential for outsized top-line growth and margin expansion potential. Our small-cap top picks are          Cavium      (CAVM),          Integrated Device Technology      (IDTI),            Inphi      (IPHI) and            Macom Technology Solutions Holdings      (MTSI).In semi-caps, we are Overweight all stocks (            Applied Materials      (AMAT),            KLA-Tencor      (KLAC),            Lam Research      (LRCX),          Orbotech      (ORBK)) with our top pick being KLA-Tencor. -- Harlan Sur  -- Bill Peterson  -- Grace Chuang The opinions contained in Investors’ Soapbox in no way represent those of Barrons.com or Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"The semiconductor sector could see earnings fall as much as 70% on average if the coronavirus pandemic triggers a global recession, according to Citi.“We believe it is time to assume a recession is coming given the extreme disruption happening to several businesses,” analyst Christopher Danely writes in a new research note. “As a result, we analyzed how far estimates fell in past downturns. We are not lowering estimates as we believe this is an exercise in futility given we’ll just have to change them again in a month and it is impossible to gauge how bad things can get.”Danely writes that his analysis of previous downturns from 2008-2019 indicates average consensus estimates can fall as much as 70% on average—with some declining 100%. In the 2008 downturn, the mean chip stock earnings estimate fell 70%—and the        PHLX Semiconductor Stock      Index, fell a stunning 88%, drastically outpacing the 39% decline in the        S&P 500.      The analyst says the companies in his coverage universe that have historical had the smallest cuts to estimates are            Xilinx      (ticker: XLNX) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), noting that both also have been among the best-performing stocks in a downturn. He thinks Xilinx will see relatively small estimate cuts this time, but that Qualcomm could have issues “given all the demand destruction in cellphones.”Danely says the largest cuts to earnings estimates historically have been suffered by            Micron      Technology (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). He thinks AMD again is likely to suffer among the largest estimate cuts, but Micron “might buck the trend.”The companies that interest Danely the most right now are            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and Micron. “Texas Instruments has been among the best performers so far during the downturn and we would expect that to continue,” he writes. “Microchip has been among the worst performers but we believe it is unwarranted and would aggressively buy the stock. We also believe Micron might buck the trend given the oligopoly in DRAM and strength in the server end market.”He also notes that “checks indicate server demand has remained strong throughout the volatile order patterns, due...to trends of more people working from home and online demand for various products.” That’s good news for            Intel      (INTC), AMD, and Micron.Semiconductor stocks have recovered more than 6.5% on Tuesday, well ahead of the 4.7% rebound by the S&P 500.

0,"Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) is the latest tech company to lower its outlook because of coronavirus’ impact on both global supply chains and demand in China. But, for now, the market seems to be looking past the current quarter issues, focusing instead on the longer-term picture.On Wednesday Skyworks (ticker: SWKS), which makes chips used by            Apple      (AAPL) and other mobile phone companies, said it now sees revenue of $760 million to $770 million for its fiscal second quarter ending March 27, down from a previous forecast of $800 million to $820 million. The company trimmed its non-GAAP profit outlook to $1.34 a share at the midpoint of the revenue range, from $1.46. “Although COVID-19 has caused no significant disruption within Skyworks’ manufacturing operations to date, the current demand environment for our products has been negatively impacted by interruptions in global supply chains,” Skyworks COE Liam Griffin said in a statement.Skywork’s revised forecast isn’t a huge surprise, given other recent warnings about Coronavirus’ impact. Apple recently said that it wouldn’t hit its previous March quarter revenue guidance of $63 billion to $67 billion, due to virus-related supply chain and demand issues in China, and there were similar warnings earlier this week from Skyworks’ rival            Qorvo      (QRVO).Here’s a quick look at the growing list of tech companies that have issued warnings for the current quarter:While most of these stocks sold off in recent weeks as the market tumbled on coronavirus fears, the specific announcements had little immediate impact on the stocks—shares of Skyworks are up 3.3% on Wednesday, to $102.88, outpacing the        S&P 500’s      2.7% gain, as of 1:45 p.m. ET. Investors continue to expect supply chain and sales disruptions caused by the coronavirus to be transitory—and that sales lost in the March quarter will mostly be made up in subsequent quarters. In short, the view is that we’re seeing orders delayed, not canceled.  Write to Eric J.

1,"Stocks tumbled Tuesday amid continuous fears over the spreading coronavirus outside of China, with a rate cut offering little to no support.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      dropped 785.91 points, or 2.94%, to close at 25,917.41. The        S&P 500      lost 86.86 points, or 2.81%, to end at 3003.37, and the        Nasdaq Composite      tumbled 268.08 points, or 2.99%, to close at 8684.09.Responding to Covid-19’s perceived economic impact, the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by half point to a range between 1.00% and 1.25% on Tuesday morning. At the following press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is in active contact with other central banks and there might be more formal coordination moving forward.This is the first rate cut outside a scheduled meeting since October 2008, and the vote was unanimous. After a brief respite, all three major stock indexes closed in the red as investors doubt that the central bank can really curb the coronavirus’ damage by loosening monetary policy. Some on Wall Street think the cut indicated that the Fed sees a credible danger of a possible credit crisis for small and midsized businesses–and consequently, a recession.Following the rate cut, gold futures jumped more than 3% and U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply to record lows as investors moved out of stocks and into haven assets. The two-year Treasury yields dropped 10.1 basis points to settle at 0.723%, 10-year yields slipped 8 basis points to 1.005%, and 30-year bond yields slid 2.2 basis points to 1.622%. The 10-year yields even briefly dropped below 1% for the first time ever. Companies continued to cut guidance, citing coronavirus impact. Following rivalMastercard      (MA), credit-card giant            Visa      (V) cut its forecast for net revenue growth in the March-ended quarter by 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points from the initial projection, citing a sharp slowdown in its cross-border business, in particular, travel-related spending. The company said it does not believe this deteriorating trend has bottomed out yet. Chip makers            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) also joined other tech companies to cut revenue guidance.Investors are also nervously watching the results from Democratic primary ballots in 14 states and one U.S. territory. Super Tuesday has typically been a strong indicator of the likely eventual nominee for the presidential election in November. More than one third of pledged delegates are up for grabs, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading candidates in the race, and others try to nab votes.

0,"Semiconductor companies are starting to admit how big a hit their sales will take from the coronavirus. But some analysts are saying it is not as bad as their worst fears, at least so far. Chip stocks tumbled last week, along with equity markets, on more reports of the coronavirus spreading outside of China. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, declined by about 10% last week.On Sunday,            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI) lowered its March quarter sales guidance by $50 million to $150 million due to the outbreak. Last month, the company gave an adjusted sales guidance range of $2.195 billion to $2.255 for its first quarter.“What we have seen is lower than expected sell-through and order push outs in both our distribution channel and with direct customers,” Richard Clemmer, NXP Chief Executive Officer, said in the release. “We need to stress that these assumptions are based on less than perfect data, as the situation in China continues to be highly fluid.”NXP shares were up 3.8% to $118.00 at 12:22 p.m. Monday.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated his Outperform rating for NXP on March 2.“Overall, given the chaos caused by the virus it feels (at least to us) that it could have been worse,” he wrote.In similar fashion, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra on Monday upgraded his rating for            Micron Technology      (MU) to Neutral from Underperform, saying memory pricing hasn’t faltered much during this health crisis.The chip maker is a leader in the DRAM and NAND semiconductor markets. DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is used in desktop computers, mobile phones, and servers, while NAND is flash memory used in smartphones and solid-state hard drives.“DRAM/NAND flash pricing positive outlooks remain unchanged despite current demand weakness in China,” he wrote. “We expect memory pricing to remain very resilient throughout this year. Server demand remains strong.”Micron stock was up 3.1% to $54.19 on Monday.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh also recommended chip stocks            Analog Devices      (ADI), NXP and            Microchip      (MCHP) on Sunday, citing their lower exposure to consumer markets.

0,"It’s been an odd year for semiconductor stocks. Fundamentally, 2019 has been challenging. For the full year, industry revenue, excluding the volatile memory sector, will be down 6% to 8% this year, after 8% growth in 2018, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur. But the stocks have been on a rip-roaring rally. The strong performance reflects anticipation of better fundamentals ahead—a recovery Sur thinks will drive further stock gains.So far this year, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (ticker: SOX) has soared 55%, well ahead of the 32% gain for the        Nasdaq Composite      and a 26% rally by the        S&P 500.      In a research note Monday morning, the J.P. Morgan analyst writes that he sees the rally extending from here. Sur projects 15% to 20% gains for the average semiconductor stock over the next 12 to 18 months, as fundamentals improve. He projects 2020 overall semiconductor industry revenue growth of 4% to 7%, with profits improving 8% to 12%.“We see strength in mobile, gaming, datacenter, and PCs with industrial demand trends likely to improve in 2020—overall driving a positive year-over-year cyclical inflection in industry growth” starting in the first half of 2020, he writes. “Longer-term, we continue to expect the semiconductor industry to exhibit relatively stable and less cyclical growth characterized by low-to mid-single-digit percentage annual revenue growth and high single-digit percentage unit growth.”Sur’s top pick in semis is            Broadcom      (AVGO), based on “under-appreciated diversification,” strong free cash flow, and dividend growth.

1," 3:04 p.m. With one hour left in the day, a quick glance at the 10 worst stocks in the        S&P 500      show a consistent theme—investors are scared of semiconductor stocks. They’re not terribly fond of garbage, either.Of the 10 worst stocks in the S&P 500 at 3:04 p.m., seven of them are semiconductor stocks. That’s no surprise following            Texas Instruments      ’ (TXN) disappointing earnings, which appears to have rekindled worries that the chip market hadn’t bottomed yet. That explains the presence of            Analog Devices      (ADI),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM),            Applied Materials      (AMAT),            Western Digital      (WDC), and            Broadcom      (AVGO).That leaves three non-chip stocks to round out 10-worst performers, and each had their own reasons for dropping. There’s            Chipotle Mexican Grill       (CMG), which beat earnings but perhaps not by enough to warrant an 85%-plus gained in 2019.            Waste Management      (WM), meanwhile, beat earnings again—it’s missed just once in the last four years—whether it rises or falls is something of a coinflip. Finally,            Nike      (NKE) fell 2.9% after announcing its CEO succession plans.1. Texas Instruments -7.6% to $118.83  2. Chipotle Mexican Grill -4.6% to $792.98  3.

0,"Semiconductor and semiconductor-equipment makers have seen their stocks rally in 2019 as some analysts and investors called a bottom in the highly cyclical market. But just because industry demand isn’t falling anymore doesn’t mean a recovery is afoot. The back story. Semiconductor stocks had a brutal second half of 2018, falling harder than the broader market. Investors looking ahead to this year saw lofty growth expectations meet the reality of a global economic growth slowdown and the U.S.-China trade war’s disruption to intertwined cross-Pacific supply chains.Christmas Eve 2018 marked the bottom for the stocks, which have rocketed back this year as investors have been willing to give chip companies another chance. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker: SOXX)—which tracks an index of U.S. semiconductor companies—has returned 35% this year, including dividends, versus a 21% return for the        S&P 500.       What’s new. While a return to growth for overall chip demand may not be in the cards yet, KeyBanc Capital Markets semiconductor analyst Weston Twigg sees evidence that at least it isn’t deteriorating further. In other words, orders for a range of chip products may be done falling, as they have been for much of 2019.“Our quarterly Asia trip and supply chain findings revealed overall demand trends remain weak, but are not getting worse,” he wrote in a report on Tuesday. “Additionally, we were encouraged to find inventories beginning to normalize and expectations for normal seasonality in 4Q.”Inventories are not as backlogged as they have been in recent quarters, and while tariffs and other trade disruptions mean that uncertainty is still high, Twigg sees chip companies’ businesses returning to normal going forward. He particularly sees CPU, GPU, and memory companies as poised to see demand stabilize.  For semiconductor-equipment companies, the picture is a bit more mixed. Capital expenditures from memory makers are still weak, but Twigg called foundry investment “robust.” Looking ahead. Twigg recommends buying            Analog Devices      (ADI),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP), and            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI). He sees demand stabilizing and channel inventories becoming more favorable for these chip makers, and upgraded each of the stocks to Overweight on Tuesday.As the U.S.-China trade conflict carries on, Twigg expects Huawei Technologies and other Chinese customers to ramp up domestic production of components for smartphones and 5G infrastructure. That’s a negative for            Xilinx      (XLNX), which Twigg downgraded to Sector Weight on Tuesday.Twigg’s long-term outlook for the sector is more mixed.“With the escalation in the trade war and the accelerated initiatives by Huawei and other China OEMs to move toward China domestic and non-U.S. sources of supply, we are increasingly concerned about long-term implications for U.S. semiconductor companies,” he wrote. “Even post a potential trade war resolution, we do not anticipate a return to normalized U.S.-supply relationships.”The            iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      was trading down 0.7%, at $209.86, on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 was down 1%.

1,"Chips stocks are reeling after President Donald Trump decided to escalate the trade conflict with China last week. But          SunTrust Robinson Humphrey      is telling clients to stay invested in the firm’s top semiconductor ideas for the eventual recovery.Trump announced plans last week to impose a 10% tariff on Sept. 1 covering $300 billion in imports from China—including many technology electronics products. The            iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor sector index, fell 2% on Thursday, 1.5% on Friday and is down 3.2% so far on Monday.“Looking through any tactical correction due to tariffs, the big move is still to the upside,” analyst William Stein wrote on Monday. “We believe patient investors will be rewarded for being long semis.” Here is a breakdown of some of the analyst’s Buy-rated chip stock calls.NXP Semiconductors N.V.      (ticker: NXPI)Stein has a $122 price target for NXP shares.NXP shares are “under-priced relative to its earnings growth,” he wrote. “We believe management has continued a strong R&D and customer engagement profile … has established a path to delivering idiosyncratic sales growth, margin expansion, and capital allocation.”Microchip Technology       (MCHP)The analyst has a $104 price forecast for Microchip stock.

0,"Semiconductor stocks sensitive to U.S.-China trade are rising on Monday morning following the weekend’s G20-sidelines meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Japan. Companies involved in semiconductor design and manufacturing have been caught in the middle of the trade war, with many firms having supply chain and customer exposure in both of the world’s two largest economies.Although all current tariffs remain in place, the Trump-Xi meeting ended with an agreement to restart trade talks. The U.S. will also potentially lift some export restrictions on suppliers doing business with Chinese telecommunications hardware giant Huawei Technologies, which has been the target of a U.S. ban since May.The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF       (ticker: SOXX), which tracks an index of U.S. stocks in the semiconductor sector, rose 3.5% on Monday morning, versus a 0.9% rise for the S&P 500. “At the request of our High Tech companies, and President Xi, I agreed to allow Chinese company Huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our National Security,” Trump tweeted on Saturday night. The president’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow later told Fox News Sunday that Huawei will remain subject to “serious” exports controls.Bullish investors’ hope is presumably that what starts as narrow exemptions on non-sensitive technologies will lead to a greater accord that includes the removal of all new tariffs imposed since last summer.“It may be that Trump’s statement, to the extent it carries any real weight (we may just be getting jaded but we have seen this before) may just indicate more willingness to be a bit more liberal in granting export licenses for specific products where national security impact is deemed minimal,” wrote Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon in a report on Monday. “...it remains unclear if anything has really changed as there are already mechanisms by which (uncontrolled) products can be sold to Huawei.”Rasgon sees high-performance computing chips or products with artificial intelligence or 5G applications most unlikely to be exempted from the export ban. He cites            Intel      (INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA), and            Analog Devices      (ADI) as potentially most exposed to products sensitive to national security concerns. The companies’ stocks rose 0.9%, 2.8%, and 1.8%, respectively, in Monday morning trading.Broadcom      (AVGO) counts Huawei as a larger customer for its networking and storage products, which Rasgon believes could have an easier path to exemptions. After declining over 20% in May as the Huawei situation deteriorated, the stock also has more ground to recover. Shares rose 5.2% on Monday.Other major semiconductor stocks rising on Monday morning include            Qualcomm      (QCOM), up 2.3%;            Texas Instruments      (TXN), up 2.6%;            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD),      up 3.9%;            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI), up 3.6%; and            Xilinx      (XLNX), up 2.7%.Smaller firms that supply some components to Huawei also saw their stocks pop on Monday.            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) rose 5.2%,            Qorvo      (QRVO) rose 5.3%,            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) rose 6.1%,            Cree       (CREE) rose 4.8%,            Marvell Technology Group Ltd.

0,"The            Cypress Semiconductor      rally continued on Thursday following a Bloomberg report that the company has hired advisors to weigh strategic alternatives after it was contacted by a potential buyer. Cypress has declined to comment. Morgan Stanley semiconductor analyst Craig Hettenbach this morning backed away from his bearish call on the stock, raising his rating to Equal Weight from Underweight and lifting his price target to $15.50 from $11.50. He remains concerned that cyclical pressures could lead to downward pressure on second-half earnings estimates for both Cypress (ticker: CY) in particular and semiconductors in general—but he adds that “the stock could receive support from potential strategic value,” given other recent merger-and-acquisitions activity in the sector.Hettenbach uses a sum-of-the-parts approach to Cypress, a maker of microcontrollers and memory chips, to reach his $15.50 price target, but adds that his bull-case valuation of $21 “ascribes higher multiples” to various pieces of the business “in the context of strategic value.” He cautions that there remains a “challenging M&A regulatory environment” that could be a headwind to any potential deal that requires approval from Chinese regulators. But he also notes that M&A activity in the sector has picked up lately, citing the pending $1.07 billion acquisition by            ON Semiconductor      (ON) for          Quantenna Communications      (QNTA) and Wednesday’s announcement that            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI) is buying            Marvell Technology Group’s      (MRVL) connectivity business for $1.76 billion. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Stein also weighed in on the Cypress situation this morning, but he takes a skeptical view, keeping his Hold rating and a $17 target price on the stock. He estimates in a research note that Cypress could be worth $19 a share in an acquisition, “not offering enough upside to justify the M&A speculation.” Stein runs through a list of potential buyers, but then dismisses most of them as not quite right. Here’s the short version:NXP: Unlikely, given the Marvell deal.Infineon Technologies      (IFX.Germany): European buyer could create regulatory issues.STMicroelectronics      (STM): M&A not a priority for ST.Texas Instruments      (TXN): Unlikely to buy a microcontroller company.Microchip Technology      (MCHP): Might have interest, but could already be too leveraged.Renesas Electronics      (6723.Japan): Recently bought Integrated Device Technology; likely limited bandwidth for nowAnalog Devices      (ADI): He sees it bulking up, but doesn’t see Cypress as the right fit.Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM): Says a “less than stellar track record” on M&A makes this an unlikely deal.Others: “At our last count there were over 100 publicly traded semiconductor companies, so we could be overlooking a potential buyer with a strong fit, however, the above list seems like a representative sample and it is not popping with good fits in our view.” As noted in an earlier post, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland told Barron’s in an interview that he thinks Cypress could be worth as much as $25 a share in a takeover.After rallying $1.86, or 12%, to $17.25 on Wednesday, Cypress stock on Thursday has gained another 41 cents, or 2.4%, to $17.66, just about a dollar shy of the stock’s 52-week high of $18.59.

All Rights ReservedCypress Semiconductor      could be worth as much as $25 a share in a takeover, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in an interview Wednesday. That would be 44% upside from the stock’s latest close.On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the chip maker is “exploring strategic options,” including a potential sale, after “receiving takeover interest.” The story, which was attributed to “people familiar with the matter,” said that Cypress (ticker: CY) has engaged with unspecified advisors on the situation. A Cypress spokesman on Wednesday told Barron’s that the company does not comment on rumors and speculation.Cypress shares rallied 12%, to $17.25 on the news Wednesday—on a down day for the        S&P 500.      At $25, Cypress would be worth a little over $9 billion.Rolland notes that the company’s new focus on producing components for both automotive and internet of things applications could make the company attractive to a variety of potential buyers, such as            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP),            Maxim Integrated Products      (MXIM), ON Semiconductor (ON),            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI), and            Qualcomm      (QCOM).Rolland, who has a “Positive” rating and a $20 price target on Cypress shares, notes that the stock’s forward P/E multiple is actually a little below that of the average semiconductor maker. He adds that he sees considerable synergies available to a potential buyer that could lift profits at Cypress by about 50% to around $1.50 a share. Apply a 17x multiple to that forecast, he adds, and the stock could be worth about $25. As noted in yesterday’s Barron’s story, Cypress executives are scheduled to speak Thursday morning at the Cowen & Co. technology conference in New York. Another factor to watch is the status of the company’s relationship with its founder and former CEO, TJ Rodgers. In 2017, Cypress settled a proxy fight with Rodgers but the standstill agreement between the two sides expires on Friday. Rodgers could not immediately be reached for comment.

0,"Ongoing trade issues could hurt shares of Micron more than most semiconductor stocks, according to new research. Micron      stock (ticker: MU) is down about 8% this month as trade tensions have escalated. President Donald Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on billions in Chinese imports and has suggested that he could go further. China has enacted its own retaliatory tariffs, and trade negotiations are ongoing. Citi Research’s Christopher Danely on Wednesday said a “tariff war” would be particularly bad for Micron, which he rates Sell. The stock is up more than 20% in 2019. A “tariff war is worst for...Micron, as there is plentiful DRAM supply and it is a commodity. As a result, China could choose to switch buying to Samsung and Hynix with limited difficulty.” (DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is used in servers and desktop computers.) Other analysts have said industry consolidation could pressure margins.  Read more: Memory Chip Prices Haven’t Bottomed Out Yet, Analyst Says FactSet’s average analyst price target for Micron is around $49. Micron stock was recently off less than 1% to $38.24.Danely is still generally positive about semiconductor stocks. Citi has Buy ratings on            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technologies      (MCHP),            Broadcom      (AVGO), and others. “Despite the downside posed by additional tariffs, we continue to believe the worst is over and would point to the downside to normal seasonality becoming increasingly small even with more tariffs,” he wrote. Prolonged trade tensions, however, could require expensive investments in production outside China, PiperJaffray analyst Harsh Kumar wrote Wednesday. PiperJaffray currently recommends            Analog Devices      (ADI), Broadcom, and            Marvell Technology Group      (MRVL).“The most likely scenario involves redistributing the supply chain globally by taking Chinese production/assembly/testing and moving it to non-U. S. based locations in order to avoid tariffs,” Kumar wrote. “The ugly component of the current environment is the potential for significant, unplanned capital expenditures in order to avoid tariffs.”Tariffs could also hurt demand for some products, especially if they are widened to cover more categories, Kumar noted.

1,"Semiconductors stocks were falling on Monday after the Chinese-American trade war heated up. Consider, the        Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index,      which includes big tech stocks such as            Intel,      (ticker: INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), plummeted 4.3% on Monday morning, its worst one day performance since Jan. 3, after            Apple      (AAPL) cut its iPhone sales forecast. Near midday, Intel was down 2.3%, Qualcomm was off 2.9% and Nvidia had slumped 4.5%. No information-technology stock in the S&P 500 was in positive territory.Even though the trade war is hitting technology investor sentiment, some analysts still see value in a few semiconductor stocks.  The back story: SunTrust analyst William Stein says semiconductors are small, light and easy to move. There has been very little “friction,” such as tariffs, within the semiconductor space for many years. This small size and the absence of tariffs “have encouraged the industry to develop with geographic specialization where bare wafers, front-end, back end, PCB population, and finished system assembly as well as semiconductor test can each occur in a different location based on specialization,” Stein writes in a Monday research report.  Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon makes another interesting point about the industry. Semiconductor products account for only 2% of the $2.3 trillion of total U.S. imports each year. That doesn’t seem like a big deal at all, as it relates to the current tariff battle, but according to Rasgon, that datum misses the point. “Semiconductor supply chains are global in nature,” writes Ragson in a research report published Sunday. “Trade data misses the bulk of the sales as most US semi manufacturing occurs outside of the US—either via foundries, or fabs located in other countries—and never enters or leaves the US.” What’s new:  Ragson thinks the larger worry for the Chinese and U.S. economies is trade war escalation. “Most semis are imported to the US from China inside semi-rich end products,” explains Rasgon. What’s more, Smartphones, computers and other electronics have been spared from tariffs, according to the analyst. If that changes, then U.S. consumers would see higher prices for their favorite electronic devices.  Looking ahead: “Increased tariffs—and even more problematic trade negotiation tools—will likely take fundamental views lower in the near-term and call a second half 2019 recovery into greater question,” writes Stein. “It’s not that difficult to imagine semis going below December lows, 28% below current levels.” Stein outlines a worst case outcome. Hopefully, it won’t come to that. But there still can be winners even in this difficult environment and it is always a good idea to look for bargains when stocks go on sale. Two stocks Stein prefers now are            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI). Microchip is integrating its 2018 purchase of Microsemi, so synergies will play a big role in that stock’s performance. And NXP trades for less than 13 times estimated 2019 earnings, a 21% discount to stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 23% year to date, far better than the 9% gain in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The reports are a sampling of analysts’ thinking; they should not be considered the views or recommendations of Barron’s. Some of the reports’ issuers have provided, or hope to provide, investment-banking or other services to the companies being analyzed.  Micron Technology      MU-NYSE  Buy Price $42.50 on March 26  by Needham As we expected, we are seeing a near-term surge in PC demand as enterprises equip their workforces with laptops to work from home. Meanwhile, the significant increase in videogaming, e-commerce, and virtual learning is placing enormous pressure on networks, driving enterprises to build out cloud infrastructure. While we are encouraged that Micron is adapting to this new reality, we are taking a cautious approach with our August estimates and forward numbers, because of the Covid-19 impact. We lower our price target to $63 from $70 to account for lower second-fiscal-quarter estimates.As Covid-19 has spread worldwide and more people are working from home, Micron has seen rising data-center demand in all regions. This has led to supply shortages, forcing Micron to shift some chip supply from smartphone to data-center applications. Micron noted that while it is likely that some customers are building inventory to be prepared in the case of supply shortages, it believes that the strength it has seen in the data-center market is real, and that inventory levels are normal at most customers. Thus, we expect to see strong growth in data-center demand in the company’s third fiscal quarter.Union Pacific      UNP-NYSE  Outperform Price $132.91 on March 26  by Evercore ISIWe are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating and a 12-month price target of $174. Union Pacific is undergoing secular and cyclical top-line challenges, which, for the most part, are being offset by robust cost savings associated with the recent implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR, initiatives, enabling it to continue to post modest earnings-per-share expansion.  We expect top-line headwinds to remain, and intensify, over the coming quarters, as Evercore ISI’s macro team forecasts a recession for the second and third quarters of 2020, with direct hits to most of Union Pacific’s core segments. However, with an established PSR leader focusing on improving Union Pacific’s network efficiency, the railroad is set to take another roughly $500 million of costs out of its network, leading to effectively flat EPS in 2020, despite an anticipated 6% revenue decline. Importantly, under a base-case scenario that projects an economic recovery next year, we believe that Union Pacific’s franchise will post high single-digit top-line growth and high-teen EPS expansion in 2021, with a jump in estimated return on invested capital. All told, although near-term macro challenges are set to remain, and likely worsen, before a material recovery, the brutal selloff and underperformance of this market leader appear overdone.Sysco      SYY-NYSE  5 stars (out of 5) Price $37.75 on March 16  by MorningstarSysco possesses a narrow moat, rooted in its cost advantages. The company benefits from lower distribution costs, given its closer proximity to customers, purchasing power, and resources to provide value-added services. As Sysco is twice the size of the No. 2 U.S. food distributor,            U.S. Foods Holding      ticker: USFD, we expect it to maintain its leadership position. However, operational execution began to slip in 2019, when Sysco failed to leverage its advantages, resulting in share losses in the coveted local-restaurant market. Furthermore, cost inflation and unexpected expenses caused the company to lower its three-year (2018-20) operating-income growth target from $650 million to $500 million to $525 million. In response, the board appointed Kevin Hourican, a 20-year veteran of the retail industry, as CEO. We are encouraged by his focus on ensuring that the company capitalizes on the full benefits of its scale. While Covid-19 should make for a challenging 2020, we expect the disruption to be short-lived, with normal traffic patterns resuming in 2021.  Sysco is aggressively tackling the $5 billion it spends on selling, general, and administrative expenses, and reducing salaried corporate support positions by 10%. We expect these initiatives to increase operating margins from 2018’s 4.3% to 4.8% by fiscal 2023. Fair value estimate: $59.Synnex      SNX-NYSE  Outperform Price $81.06 on March 25  by Barrington ResearchThe company which provides business-to-business services reported fiscal first-quarter non-GAAP EPS of $3.26, which exceeded our forecast of $3.14 and the FactSet consensus forecast of $3.08. Revenue of $5.3 billion was 2% less than our forecast and the FactSet forecast. Technology Solutions revenue was 2% less than our forecast, and Concentrix revenue, 1% less. Concentrix offers, among other services, end-to-end business outsourcing, process optimization, and front- and back-office automation.We are reducing our fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS forecasts to $3.30 and $13.58, from $14.38 and $15.12, respectively, because of  the impact of the coronavirus. While our investment rating on Synnex shares remains Outperform, we are reducing our 12-month price target to $96 from $150.

All Rights ReservedIn the days before coronavirus, when markets were hitting new highs, technology stocks were the tip of the spear. Just a few weeks ago, there were four U.S. companies with market valuations above $1 trillion, all of them tech stocks. Those companies—            Microsoft       (ticker: MSFT),            Apple      (AAPL),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and Google parent            Alphabet      (GOOGL)—with their fortress-solid balance sheets, are poised to come out of the downturn just as strong as they went in. But for intrepid tech investors, there are less obvious opportunities to be found amid the current carnage and chaos.To help find the best ideas, Barron’s reached out to a few of our favorite tech-focused stockpickers. Some clear themes run through their recommendations: The work-from-home revolution underlines the power of cloud computing; we all still need to be entertained, even if we’re stuck at home; and we’re still going to need broadband, now more than ever.Here’s what the experts have to say: David Readerman Readerman is proprietor of Endurance Capital Partners, a San Francisco–based tech hedge fund. Readerman has zeroed in on cloud plays. “What’s certainly being reinforced right now,” he says, “is that cloud-based information-technology architecture is providing agility and resiliency for companies to operate dispersed workforces.”Readerman says the jury is out on whether there’s a lasting impact on how we work, but he adds that contingency planning now requires the ability to work remotely for extended periods. Among his cloud software picks are            DocuSign      (DOCU), a provider of digital-signature software, and            Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), the videoconferencing company that has been one of the year’s best stocks. “If there was ever doubt about the migration of the enterprise to cloud platforms, Covid-19 has proved its capabilities,” he says.Readerman concedes that Zoom’s valuation looks extreme—the stock trades at 34 times Wall Street’s sales estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2022—but he says there’s an opportunity for Zoom to monetize its surge in new users. He thinks that Zoom can expand beyond videoconferencing to offer a wider range of tools. “Zoom reminds me of AOL when it was everywhere, with ease of use and the freemium model,” he says.Readerman is bullish, too, on data center operators like            Equinix       (EQIX) and            Digital Realty Trust      (DLR). On the more speculative side, he likes their smaller rivals,            CyrusOne      (CONE) and            CoreSite Realty       (COR), which could be consolidation targets. He says that            Equinix      is seeing a surge in traffic to its servers, another sign of the growth of the cloud-computing trend. “Grocery stores are sold out of toilet paper, and we all need more broadband,” he says. Companies like            Equinix,      he adds, are “the critical on/off ramp for internet-based connectivity and commerce.” Rich Greenfield Greenfield, the co-founder of research boutique LightShed Partners, has covered entertainment and media companies for 25 years. His coverage universe was dealing with disruption—the technological kind—long before coronavirus, but the pandemic is creating a set of more serious challenges, with movie theaters and theme parks closed, sports shuttered, and ad budgets crunched. Greenfield notes that 12 of the top 50 TV advertisers are ailing auto makers; another 11 are quick-serve restaurant chains. The lack of sports content is particularly problematic on the advertising front. The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was canceled, and the National Basketball Association season, Major League Baseball, and the Olympics have all been delayed. There is no clarity on when the event calendar will pick up—and when people will be comfortable in public settings. “How long does it last?” Greenfield asks. “Does the stimulus ward off a recession or depression? It’s hard to tell. No one knows how to forecast this.”But people still crave entertainment, and that’s keeping Greenfield bullish on            Netflix      (NFLX). Unlike most content companies, Netflix sells no ads. And while movie and TV production is shut, Netflix has several months of new content ready to go. “They’re in a really strong position relative to their peers,” he says, pointing to            Walt Disney      (DIS), which has been battered on multiple fronts—its ESPN has no sports to show, its theme parks are closed, and it has no open theaters through which to distribute films. The weak ad market, meanwhile, is problematic for Disney’s broadcast and cable properties.Says Greenfield: “More people are using Netflix than ever before.” He notes that the number of subscribers is accelerating, which isn’t surprising given all of the home-bound people with more hours to fill and no sports to watch. He says Netflix will benefit from people switching to more expensive multiple-user plans and from reduced churn, or cancellations. In coming quarters, he says, Netflix will have “higher subscriptions, higher average revenue per user, and better free cash flow than people think.” Greenfield is also bullish on            Twitter      (TWTR), which this past week warned that revenue for its March quarter would be down year over year, as ad budgets fall. But, he notes, Twitter is seeing record usage. While profits and revenue will take a near-term hit, he points out that Twitter can withstand the crisis, with $6.6 billion in cash. And the company is poised to benefit from a crowded events calendar once the virus threat ebbs. “There aren’t enough weekends on the calendar for all the stuff coming down from September through summer 2021,” Greenfield says, with spring sporting events shifted to the fall, a packed film-release schedule, and the November election. “It’s absurd.” And he thinks it will all drive traffic—and ad dollars—to Twitter.  Paul Meeks Meeks wears multiple hats, as a portfolio manager for Independent Solutions Wealth Management, an asset management firm in Williamsville, N.Y., and a manager of The Wireless Fund, a small tech mutual fund. Meeks say that he has been using the recent rally to raise cash, while dabbling in marquee names and “banking proceeds for a better day.” Meeks says that he’s waiting until “earnings estimates are slashed to the bone” before making substantial new commitments. “I need to see them all confess all their sins, and to take down numbers dramatically.” In the meantime, Meeks has been nibbling on megacaps, specifically Amazon and            Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA), both of which he thinks will benefit from the expanded role that e-commerce will play in the post-coronavirus world. Eventually, he says, when earnings estimates reset, he wants to own his “dream team of semiconductor stocks,” including            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD),            Lam Research      (LRCX),            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing      (TSM),            Micron Technology      (MU), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT), where he expects to go from basically zero to a big overweight. Meanwhile, Meeks is bullish on            Virtu Financial      (VIRT), a New York–based tech-driven financial trading platform. Meeks sees the company as a play on volatility. He notes that Virtu trades for about 10 times earnings and pays a “fairly certain” dividend, currently yielding 4.3%. “When stocks go up endlessly again, and investors are complacent, they become an average company again,” he says. But, for now, Virtu will benefit as long as we continue to see “whipsaw moves in both directions.” Dan Niles Niles is founder and portfolio manager for the Satori Fund, a tech-focused hedge fund. On Feb. 17, just after Apple pulled its March quarter guidance, Niles tweeted that he had 50% of his portfolio short Apple, seven of the company’s suppliers, and        QQQ,      an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. It was a prescient call. Niles remains generally bearish on the market, but there are stocks he likes and owns, particularly around videogames. While Niles thinks the market has exaggerated the impact of a fifth-generation, or 5G, iPhone launch later this year, he sees opportunity in a less-watched product cycle: new videogame consoles from Microsoft and            Sony      (SNE), expected this fall. “They’re going to launch the first new hardware platforms since 2013, and everyone is stuck at home,” he says. “I like them all,” he says of the videogame stocks, including            Zynga      (ZNGA),            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO), and            Electronic Arts      (EA), along with China’s            NetEase      (NTES) and            Tencent Holdings      (700.Hong Kong).Other Niles bets are Amazon, a beneficiary from the shift to e-commerce, and work-at-home play            RingCentral      (RNG), a cloud-based communications provider. Meanwhile, he’s still ready to short Apple again as the stock rallies. For one thing, he says, “I don’t know who is going to feel rich enough to buy an iPhone.” And he wonders why anyone would pay 19 times current earnings for Apple, when other hardware plays like            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ) trade for just seven times.  Craig Moffett Moffett, founder of the research boutique MoffettNathanson, is the market’s most influential telecom and cable seer. He predicts deep issues for some of the largest companies he covers, notably            AT&T      (T) and            Comcast      (CMCSA), given their exposure to ad-supported content through their respective WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal segments. AT&T and Comcast are getting a boost from their broadband units, but Moffett sees better ways to play that trend.He’s bullish on            Charter Communications      (CHTR) and            Altice USA       (ATUS), both pure plays on the cable business and, therefore, free of ad-supported content worries. Charter is down 13% over the past month. “The fact that Charter has sold off as much as the broader market makes no sense at all,” Moffett says. “The cable companies are simply digital infrastructure providers. They are agnostic about how you can get your video content. And the broadband business is going to be just fine.” He says that Altice, while a little riskier than Charter, is even cheaper. Both companies are seeing demand for faster—and more expensive—broadband plans, with parents and children spending so many hours at home. Moffett thinks that Altice could rally 40% to 50%, while Charter could rise 30% to 40%. Moffett is also bullish on            T-Mobile US      (TMUS), which is about to be a strong No. 3 player in the U.S. wireless market after it closes a pending deal to buy            Sprint      (S). “They’ll be very well positioned, with line of sight to cost savings and margin expansion, and network advantages that should translate into market-share gains for years and years to come,” he says. And while Moffett still sees some risk to the deal’s completion, he thinks that T-Mobile is attractive with or without Sprint.  Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedRevenue and profit estimates for the semiconductor industry continue to ratchet lower, amid a range of both supply-chain and demand issues. And the same process is under way for the chip equipment makers that serve them. But for both sectors, there are values to find if you know where to look.This morning, UBS chip analyst Timothy Arcuri reset estimates for his entire coverage universe, which includes all of the major chip and equipment companies. For most of the companies he covers, he reduced revenue forecasts for both 2020 and 2021, and he brought price targets down for most of the stocks he covers as well. He also shifted some ratings around. In a few cases, he’s feeling more bullish.Arcuri notes that revenue for the semiconductor industry fell 35% in two quarters during the 2008-09 downturn, and took three quarters to fully recover. But he adds that comparisons are easier this time, coming off a weak 2019, especially for memory chips. He writes that his new base case is for a 20% drop in semiconductor revenues through the September quarter with a gradual recovery to parity by June 2021. Calendar 2020 revenues, he says, will be off 15%-20% from pre-virus estimates. He adds that “computer” related stocks—            Intel       (ticker: INTC) and            Nvidia       (NVDA), for instance—should be more defensive, and that supply constraints should help on memory. (He likes            Micron.      ) But he sees risks for smartphone-related stocks, and weakness in the automotive chip sector.For the equipment sector, he says, revenue will follow semis lower, but he’s more bullish on the group than he is on chips. He says that “supply constraints should keep order books full making the snap-back faster than for semis,” and he adds that there are “few if any weak balance sheets among top chip spenders.” Arcuri also notes that Chinese customers “remain full speed ahead and may even accelerate timeliness.”Arcuri on Friday lifted his ratings on            Lam Research      (LRCX) to Buy from Sell and on            KLA       (KLAC) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) to Neutral from Sell. He also upgrades            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Neutral from Sell.His bullish stance on Lam reflects the company’s out-sized exposure to the memory sector. He writes that Applied has growing exposure to memory, though he is concerned about the company’s display business, and he sees risk in its large exposure to the contract chip manufacturer            Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM). He says KLA should get a boost from supply constraint issues in the equipment sector, though he thinks the story in the foundry and logic end markets—where KLA has significant exposure—isn’t as compelling as it is for memory.On Texas Instruments, Arcuri says that he still has concerns about their big exposure to the automotive and industrial vertical markets, but that the issue is already reflected in the stock price. “Virtually all of the company’s revenue growth over the past 4 years has come from this vertical so this remains a concern as we look forward but the sell side has also been aggressively cutting global production estimates over the past few weeks and highly visible production shut-downs in Europe make it hard to argue that investors have not contemplated this as a risk,” he writes.In Friday trading, amid a sharp market slide, chip and equipment stocks are trading lower across the board, with Lam, Arcuri’s favorite, down 6.4%, to $243.42.

All Rights ReservedDell Technologies      and its majority-owned subsidiary            VMware      have both withdrawn their financial guidance, citing uncertainties about their businesses created by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Both companies made their announcements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Dell (ticker: DELL) said in its filing that it is seeing “heightened interest in work from home solutions and continuing execution in its global supply chain, and remains confident in its liquidity position,” but that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operations for the current fiscal year.” Dell had previously projected revenue for its February 2021 fiscal year of $92 billion to $95 billion, with profits of $5.90 to $6 a share. At the time, Dell said the outlook didn’t reflect any potential impact from the virus.Likewise, VMware (VMW) said in its own SEC filing that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operation,” and therefore it is withdrawing its previous guidance for both the May quarter and the February 2021 fiscal year. The company’s previous guidance had been for full-year revenue of $12.05 billion, with May-quarter revenues of $2.73 billion.On Thursday, PC-related stocks got a boost from some bullish comments after the close on Wednesday from memory chip company            Micron Technology      (MU), which said that it was seeing a boost in demand from strong PC sales as more people upgrade their systems to handle extended periods of working and studying from home. Dell’s announcement removes some of the shine from yesterday’s optimism.Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong points out in a research note Friday that while many semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have withdrawn guidance in recent weeks, many hardware companies have not, such as            HP Inc.      (HPQ),            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Lenovo Group      (0992.Hong Kong), and            Pure Storage      (PSTG). His conclusion is that the announcement “was not entirely unexpected given market conditions.” But Ong still likes Dell shares, asserting that the company has “several underappreciated offsets,” including market share gains, downside protection given a low valuation, and deleveraging potential. He keeps his Buy rating on the stock.Dell stock is down 7.2%, to $39.48, in recent trading, while VMware is down 8.2%, to $114.48. Dell rival HP Inc. is off 6.9%, to $16.72.

0,"Add servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

1,"Micron Technology      shares are higher in late trading Wednesday after the memory chip company posted better-than-expected results for its fiscal second quarter ended Feb. 27. The upside was driven by strong demand from both the data center and PC markets. For the quarter, Micron (ticker: MU) posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion.

Micron shares are down 21% this year, versus a 24% decline for the        S&P 500.      For the May quarter, the company sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been $4.9 billion and 54 cents. There had been some concerns on the Street that estimates were too high, but instead the forecast was right in line with expectations.“Micron delivered solid second quarter results and revenue at the high end of the guidance range, despite the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic,” Micron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement.Micron said it bought back about 785,000 shares for $44 million in the quarter, and ended the period with $8.12 billion in cash and equivalents, or $2.70 billion on a net cash basis.In remarks prepared for its quarterly call with investors, Micron said that as of yesterday it has two employees who have tested positive for coronavirus.“At the two sites where we have confirmed cases, we have used contact tracing to quarantine individuals who were in close contact with either infected team member,” the company said. “We have also implemented more restrictive controls of on-site access, social distancing and service protocols.” Micron said these events so far have not impacted manufacturing operations.Micron added that the pandemic “is significantly impacting China’s economic growth in the calendar first quarter, reflected in the sharp decline of smartphone and automobile unit sales.” The company added that “weaker sell-through of consumer electronics and our customers’ factory shutdowns in China were headwinds for us” late in the fiscal second quarter.On the other hand, Micron said that lower consumer demand in China “was offset by stronger data center demand due to increased gaming, e-commerce and remote work activity.” And looking ahead, Micron said “data center demand in all regions looks strong and is leading to supply shortages.” The company added that it is seeing “a recent increase in demand for notebooks used in the commercial and educational segments to support work-from-home and virtual learning initiatives occurring in many parts of the world.”Micron said it is “encouraged to see manufacturers in China increasingly returning to full production,” adding that it has “recently started to see China smartphone manufacturing volumes recover.”Micron still said it expects “overall demand for smartphones, consumer electronics and automobiles will be below our prior expectations for the second half of our fiscal 2020.” Micron said it is “modeling an improvement in the trajectory of economic activity later into the second half of calendar 2020, with a further rebound in economic momentum into 2021.”Micron said it has been shifting supply from smartphones to the data center markets, for both DRAM modules as well as solid-state drives. The company added that it is “evaluating our production levels and capex plans for calendar 2020 and will adjust to the most recent demand requirements.”Once we emerge from the crisis, Micron says, it expects the industry to resume its long-term growth trajectory for memory products, with DRAM demand growth in the mid-to-high teens and NAND in the 30% range.

0,"Heading into 2020,            Micron Technology      was set up for a major financial upswing, with pricing of both DRAM and NAND flash-memory chips widely expected to spike off recent lows. And then along came coronavirus.Micron (ticker: MU) will post financial results on Wednesday for its fiscal second quarter ended in February, providing fresh concrete data points on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the semiconductor sector. When it reported its previous results, the company projected revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion for its second quarter, with profit of 35 cents a share. Street consensus is $4.7 billion and 37 cents.Among Wall Street analysts, there is confidence that the company can hit Wall Street estimates for the quarter, but growing concern that the current consensus for the May quarter—$4.92 billion in revenue and profit of 54 cents a share—looks too high. Keep in mind that Micron’s memory chips go into products that are under serious pressure from both supply-chain and demand issues—- personal computers, printers, mobile phones and servers. J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur on Monday repeated his Overweight rating and $65 price target on the stock. He thinks the second quarter will benefit from a favorable pricing environment and strong cloud data-center demand, “potentially offset by weaker demand, seasonality, and supply chain impacts late in the quarter from Covid-19.” He thinks guidance for the current quarter could be as much as 30% below current Street consensus “on near-term uncertainty and lack of visibility from customers navigating an uncertain demand environment and from continued supply-chain disruptions as a result of Covid-19.”Sur said that “the full impact of Covid-19, especially on the back half of the year, is not clear,” but that the demand environment is likely “to be mixed with continued strength in cloud data center and gaming offset by weaker trends in consumer products such as PCs, smartphones, and autos.” But he also contended that “with continued supply discipline and expectations of a continued favorable pricing environment…Micron can continue expanding closely watched gross margin, helping to partially offset reduced bit shipments.”Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho likewise is sticking with his Buy rating headed into the earnings announcement. He said his checks have found continued pricing strength, with data-center customers driving solid demand. He said economic conditions could muffle the revival in the DRAM market, in particular. But he also said that with the stock off 40% from its recent peak and trading at 1.1 times book value, Micron offers favorable risk-reward.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer maintained his Outperform rating on Micron shares, too. He noted that Micron is the first chip company to report results and provide guidance since the spread of Covid-19 on a global basis. “Given the extremely high level of uncertainty, we expect management to err on the side of conservatism,” he wrote. But he noted that the company’s liquidity position—it recently drew down its $2.5 billion revolving credit line—supports necessary investments against any economic backdrop.Micron shares are down 22% this year, versus a 24% decline for the        S&P 500 .

0,"The semiconductor sector could see earnings fall as much as 70% on average if the coronavirus pandemic triggers a global recession, according to Citi.“We believe it is time to assume a recession is coming given the extreme disruption happening to several businesses,” analyst Christopher Danely writes in a new research note. “As a result, we analyzed how far estimates fell in past downturns. We are not lowering estimates as we believe this is an exercise in futility given we’ll just have to change them again in a month and it is impossible to gauge how bad things can get.”Danely writes that his analysis of previous downturns from 2008-2019 indicates average consensus estimates can fall as much as 70% on average—with some declining 100%. In the 2008 downturn, the mean chip stock earnings estimate fell 70%—and the        PHLX Semiconductor Stock      Index, fell a stunning 88%, drastically outpacing the 39% decline in the        S&P 500.      The analyst says the companies in his coverage universe that have historical had the smallest cuts to estimates are            Xilinx      (ticker: XLNX) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), noting that both also have been among the best-performing stocks in a downturn. He thinks Xilinx will see relatively small estimate cuts this time, but that Qualcomm could have issues “given all the demand destruction in cellphones.”Danely says the largest cuts to earnings estimates historically have been suffered by            Micron      Technology (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). He thinks AMD again is likely to suffer among the largest estimate cuts, but Micron “might buck the trend.”The companies that interest Danely the most right now are            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and Micron. “Texas Instruments has been among the best performers so far during the downturn and we would expect that to continue,” he writes. “Microchip has been among the worst performers but we believe it is unwarranted and would aggressively buy the stock. We also believe Micron might buck the trend given the oligopoly in DRAM and strength in the server end market.”He also notes that “checks indicate server demand has remained strong throughout the volatile order patterns, due...to trends of more people working from home and online demand for various products.” That’s good news for            Intel      (INTC), AMD, and Micron.Semiconductor stocks have recovered more than 6.5% on Tuesday, well ahead of the 4.7% rebound by the S&P 500.

DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is used in desktop computers, mobile phones, and servers, while NAND is flash memory used in smartphones and solid-state hard drives.On Tuesday, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Weston Twigg reaffirmed his Overweight rating and $63 price target for Micron stock.“Memory companies could be reasonably well positioned amid coronavirus outbreak,” he wrote. “There’s risk that demand could soften sharply. However, limited supply, coupled with strong datacenter demand, could provide support for stable or increasing pricing over the near term.”Micron shares were down 5.2% to $45.35 on Wednesday.The analyst said as more people work remotely from home they will use more cloud-based applications, which will require more memory for servers. He predicts in the near term, memory prices may rise as a result.

0," Wall Street started out the week wildly bullish: Analysts upgraded 41 stocks Monday and downgraded only 6, marking the most upgrades in one day over the past 30 days, according to data aggregated by Bloomberg and examined by Barron’s. It is also the most net upgrades in one day over the past month, at 35. Net ratings changes, of course, are the number of upgrades minus the number of downgrades. The question now is what this means for investors. Is this a buying signal for the wary—a sign that stocks are cheap enough after the coronavirus selloff? Or is it just one random data point that investors can safely ignore? The truth—as is often the case—lies in the middle. Stock valuations have come down significantly, making the market look more attractive. But uncertainty still reigns. The coronavirus selloff has been swift and brutal. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      dropped 12.4% last week. The        S&P 500      fell 11.5%. Both indexes entered correction territory, defined as a drop of 10% from recent highs. It was the fastest the S&P 500 has ever entered a correction from an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market data. The steep selloff has taken the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P from about 19 times estimated 2020 earnings to about 17 times estimated earnings. Nineteen times is almost 20% higher than historical averages. Seventeen times is close to what Wall Street considers normal these days. It is hard to say if recent declines catalyzed the ratings actions. For starters, there are more ratings changes on a Monday than on the average day. Analysts, after all, have all weekend to ponder what has transpired recently. And analysts, over recent weeks, have tended to be a little more bullish on Monday than the rest of the week, data shows. But Wall Street analysts, overall, have been more bearish lately, which makes Monday’s data point a little more relevant. There have been about 10% more downgrades than upgrades over the past month. Over time upgrades and downgrades, in aggregate, should be just about balanced. The negative bias lately signals that analysts were feeling a little concerned over valuation. The upgrade and downgrade numbers are, of course, an aggregation., and look down on the market from a great height. The aggregation doesn’t say anything about why things are being upgraded or what sectors are falling in or out of favor. Energy shares, for instance, have gotten hit harder during the recent selloff because oil prices are falling. Benchmark crude prices are down more than 20% year to date. That hurts sentiment for even the most bullish energy analysts. There was one energy upgrade Monday.            Goldman Sachs      upgraded oil refiner            HollyFrontier      (HFC) from the equivalent of Sell to Hold. Shares are down 35% year to date. As a refiner, the company’s earnings are more about energy spreads—such as the difference between oil and gasoline prices—and less about the absolute level of crude. But it’s difficult to divine a bigger takeaway about energy from Monday’s upgrade figures. There were a lot of technology upgrades Monday too. Tech stocks have been beaten up because of exposure to China, where a lot of semiconductors and electronics are built and assembled. Baird, for instance, upgraded            Micron Technology      (MU)to the equivalent of Hold from Sell and upgraded            Western Digital      (WDC) to the equivalent of Buy from Hold. Both shares have been affected by coronavirus fears. Western Digital stock is down about 16% from recent highs. Micron shares have fallen 10% recently. Baird, apparently, sees opportunity after the selloff. There are a million ways to slice and dice any data set, including upgrades and downgrades. Monday’s slew of ratings changes is worth examining because it’s an outlier. And for the broader market, it’s a good—albeit small—sign that some analysts are seeing more opportunity, while the rest of the market sees fear.

All Rights ReservedSemiconductor companies are starting to admit how big a hit their sales will take from the coronavirus. But some analysts are saying it is not as bad as their worst fears, at least so far. Chip stocks tumbled last week, along with equity markets, on more reports of the coronavirus spreading outside of China. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, declined by about 10% last week.On Sunday,            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI) lowered its March quarter sales guidance by $50 million to $150 million due to the outbreak. Last month, the company gave an adjusted sales guidance range of $2.195 billion to $2.255 for its first quarter.“What we have seen is lower than expected sell-through and order push outs in both our distribution channel and with direct customers,” Richard Clemmer, NXP Chief Executive Officer, said in the release. “We need to stress that these assumptions are based on less than perfect data, as the situation in China continues to be highly fluid.”NXP shares were up 3.8% to $118.00 at 12:22 p.m. Monday.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated his Outperform rating for NXP on March 2.“Overall, given the chaos caused by the virus it feels (at least to us) that it could have been worse,” he wrote.In similar fashion, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra on Monday upgraded his rating for            Micron Technology      (MU) to Neutral from Underperform, saying memory pricing hasn’t faltered much during this health crisis.The chip maker is a leader in the DRAM and NAND semiconductor markets. DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is used in desktop computers, mobile phones, and servers, while NAND is flash memory used in smartphones and solid-state hard drives.“DRAM/NAND flash pricing positive outlooks remain unchanged despite current demand weakness in China,” he wrote. “We expect memory pricing to remain very resilient throughout this year. Server demand remains strong.”Micron stock was up 3.1% to $54.19 on Monday.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh also recommended chip stocks            Analog Devices      (ADI), NXP and            Microchip      (MCHP) on Sunday, citing their lower exposure to consumer markets.

All Rights ReservedWestern Digital’s      stock is trading higher after a pair of analyst upgrades. They follow a recent selloff in the shares of the disk-drive and NAND memory chip company.Amid concerns about the impact on the tech supply chain from coronavirus, shares of Western Digital (ticker: WDC) had their own private bear market, falling 21% from Feb. 12 through Friday, while shares of rival            Seagate      Technology (STX) fell 15% over the same span.Stifel analyst Patrick Ho has lifted his rating on Western Digital shares to Buy from Hold, with a new price target of $73, up from $63. “While we clearly acknowledge that the current coronavirus situation could impact near-term estimates, we believe our fundamental outlook for 2020 remains intact,” Ho wrote in a research note issued over the weekend. Ho is in the camp that says the virus issue is simply pushing out demand for mobile phones, PCs, and other tech goods—not destroying it. “We believe the entire electronics ecosystem continues to experience levels of supply constraints, which could push out demand by a quarter or more,” he said. “We believe structurally, demand has not changed but the ability to produce products can impact the ability to meet near-term demand.”He added that “current tightness in the flash memory market is likely only to intensify as the supply chain gets further constrained in the near term. This will benefit the industry, as well as Western Digital if the supply tightness intensifies further.”Baird analyst Tristan Gerra lifted his ratings on Monday for Western Digital, Seagate, and            Micron Technology      (MU). He went to Outperform from Underperform on Western Digital, to Outperform from Neutral on Seagate and to Neutral from Underperform on Micron. His prices targets moved up to $75 from $60 on Western Digital, to $60 from $54 on Seagate, and to $55 from $45 on Micron.Gerra wrote that the outlook for both NAND and DRAM memory chip pricing looks positive for 2020 despite current demand weakness in China. Pricing will “remain resilient” throughout the year, and memory demand from server manufacturers remains strong, he says. And he thinks that stimulus plans in China “could drive a second-half demand rebound” for smartphones and PCs.He adds that Western Digital should benefit from improved product mix in hard disk drives and continued strength in data centers. And he thinks Seagate can gain market share, driven by demand for the company’s new 16 TB disk drives. He notes, though that “near term, supply chain disruption and weak demand in China for consumer segments such as PCs and surveillance cameras should negatively impact hard disk drive revenue, utilization rates, and gross margin, partially offset by initial signs of a rebound in the China server market and continued strength in the U.S. data center market.”WD shares bounced back on Monday, rising 5%, to $58.33.

1,"Multiple chip stocks are heading lower Tuesday in the wake of            Apple’s      announcement that its March-quarter revenue will fall short of previous guidance due to the impact of the spreading coronavirus crisis on both contract manufacturing and retail sales in China.Apple (ticker: AAPL) had previously forecast March-quarter revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion but now says it won’t reach that level, and Wall Street estimates are dropping to the $60 billion level or lower. Barclays      analyst Blayne Curtis published a list of component makers Tuesday morning by their revenue exposure to Apple—and most of the names on the list are heading lower. Note, though, that the losses are modest, a reflection of the relatively muted reaction to the announcement on Apple shares. Analysts are cutting their estimates on Apple’s March-quarter results but lifting projections for the June quarter. The widespread view is that the long-term impact on Apple’s business will be minimal.On the other hand, for companies who makes parts for mobile phones, exposure goes beyond Apple and includes both China-based phone makers like Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi and other Android handset makers who rely on Chinese contract manufacturers.Here’s the Barclays list of chip stocks ranked by estimated revenue exposure to Apple:Curtis also ranks chip companies by exposure to Huawei, the leading Chinese mobile-phone manufacturer, and by exposure to non-Huawei Android phone makers like            Samsung Electronics      (005930.Korea):Huawei exposure:Non-Huawei Android phone exposure:In early trading Tuesday, shares of Apple, Micron, Cirrus, Qorvo, Lumentum, and Skyworks were all off more than 2%.

Stifel raised its target for the S&P 500 to 3450 from 3260 on Tuesday.Stocks moved in the right direction on Wednesday. The        S&P 500       rose 0.65% to 3379.45, its 11th record close this year. while the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      gained 0.9% to 29551.42, its seventh record.The market will continue to gain as the global rate of coronavirus cases reaches its peak and ebbs, Barry Bannister, Stifel’s head of institutional equity strategy, said in a research note. Current “financial conditions and liquidity” indicate the S&P 500 could reach 3800 by the end of the year, but a recession remains possible, Bannister said. He set his overall target at 3450 to reflect the risk that a downturn will hold the market back, or drag it lower.Areas to watch, Bannister said, include a potential inversion in the yield curve, a time-tested recession indicator, when yields on 2-year Treasury debt rise above those on 10-year securities. Recession risks that Bannister identified include the coronavirus outbreak, the trade war with China, U.S.-Iran conflict, and the delayed impact of “past policy errors” by the Federal Reserve and over trade. Bannister is also keeping an eye on U.S. unemployment rates in the second quarter, another potential recession signal.In 2020, Bannister says, cyclical stocks will outperform the overall market. “If the recession wall of worry is hurdled, we see greater price leverage in our index of 25 equal-weighted large-capitalization ‘recovery stocks’ within Technology, Financials, Energy, Industrials and Materials,” Bannister wrote.

0,"The fiscal and monetary policy fire hose is blasting with all its might. The Federal Reserve has dropped interest rates to near zero and is purchasing limitless quantities of Treasuries and other securities. Congress is taking advantage of the practically free money, having passed a $2 trillion spending package worth about 9% of U.S. gross domestic product.Those new fiscal and monetary measures and signs of improving liquidity in several markets helped ignite a three-day megarally spanning Tuesday to Thursday this past week. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      rose over 21% in that span, signifying the beginning of a new bull market after just 11 trading days in a bear market. After the index’s eighth losing Friday in nine weeks, the Dow ended the week up 2,462.80 points, or 12.84%, to 21,636.78—its best week since 1938. The        S&P 500      index gained 10.26%, to 2,541.47, and the        Nasdaq Composite      rose 9.05%, to 7502.38.The strict “20% up from a low point” definition of a bull market can be deceptive. Large and fast rallies are frequent characteristics of longer-term bearish periods in the market. The last time the Dow went from its bear-market low to a bull market in just three days was from Oct. 6 to Oct. 8, 1931. Then, as now, trading was extremely volatile, with big daily moves both to the upside and the downside. And that bull market didn’t last long. By November 1931, the Dow was in a bear market again, down more than 20%. It didn’t bottom out until mid-1932, down an additional 60%-plus.Others don’t declare a new bull market until the index surpasses its previous high, and would call last week’s action just a bear-market rally. But semantics aside, there are signs to suggest that for the stock market, the worst may be behind us thanks to the Fed and Congress. Calling their moves “stimulus” might be using the wrong term because the package isn’t designed to lift economic activity, but to preserve as much of what already exists as possible while the nation shuts down. The recession is likely already here, but the probability of the coronavirus crisis setting off a 1930s-style multiyear depression is low.But in a twist, the extraordinary monetary and fiscal aid could become a stimulus should low interest rates and a higher level of federal spending remain in place once the virus’ peak has passed.“If you assume normality returns after the virus’ peak occurs, then if activity begins to normalize in some way and this is left in place, it could become stimulus,” says Colin Moore, global chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.And while the next few weeks or months could still be bumpy, investors should begin combing through the wreckage of March’s selloff to adjust their portfolios for the market’s next phase, call it a bull or still a bear.Where to start? Not with defensive sectors like consumer staples or utilities, which have already done their job during the selloff, handily outperforming the rest of the market on its way down. That leaves the rest of the market with more room to rebound, and with greater relative economic tailwinds on the horizon. “Bear markets always end with a recession,” says Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. “Now you want to be positioning for the recovery, which means start moving away from defensives and toward cyclicals.”That doesn’t mean going all-in on the most coronavirus-sensitive industries, like casinos, cruise lines, or retailers. But some high-quality early-cycle exposure is good to have, especially with stocks available at a steep discount to where they were just a month ago.Wilson recommends a barbell approach, adding some more cyclically geared financials or consumer-discretionary stocks on one end, and high-quality names with solid balance sheets and high profitability on the other. The cyclicals are riskier, but with higher potential upside, while the quality names are surer bets but with lower potential returns—given that many haven’t dropped nearly as much on the way down.Morgan Stanley analysts point to            S&P Global      (ticker: SPGI),            BorgWarner      (BWA), and            Linde      (LIN) as among those with the greatest history of outperformance in the recovery after large selloffs followed by recessions. High-quality growers include some of the megacap tech companies like            Microsoft      (MSFT) or            Amazon.com      (AMZN).Moore is moving to take on some more risk in fixed income, having previously taken down exposure to high-yield corporate bonds in several portfolios. He’s not as keen to get back into CCC-rated and other low-grade credit, but he sees value in the higher-grade areas of high yield and in investment grade, particularly now that some of the market liquidity issues have been sorted out.As for stock selection, Moore is focused on 2021. “How much you believe in the recovery in 2021 will be what drives markets, so stop worrying about the earnings for 2020,” he says. “Because, frankly, by the time the dust settles and volatility is down enough, you could be into the third quarter when you’re beginning to discount 2021 anyway.”The trick for investors is getting there before everyone else does. With monetary and fiscal cover in place, that time is now.

All Rights ReservedIn the days before coronavirus, when markets were hitting new highs, technology stocks were the tip of the spear. Just a few weeks ago, there were four U.S. companies with market valuations above $1 trillion, all of them tech stocks. Those companies—            Microsoft       (ticker: MSFT),            Apple      (AAPL),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and Google parent            Alphabet      (GOOGL)—with their fortress-solid balance sheets, are poised to come out of the downturn just as strong as they went in. But for intrepid tech investors, there are less obvious opportunities to be found amid the current carnage and chaos.To help find the best ideas, Barron’s reached out to a few of our favorite tech-focused stockpickers. Some clear themes run through their recommendations: The work-from-home revolution underlines the power of cloud computing; we all still need to be entertained, even if we’re stuck at home; and we’re still going to need broadband, now more than ever.Here’s what the experts have to say: David Readerman Readerman is proprietor of Endurance Capital Partners, a San Francisco–based tech hedge fund. Readerman has zeroed in on cloud plays. “What’s certainly being reinforced right now,” he says, “is that cloud-based information-technology architecture is providing agility and resiliency for companies to operate dispersed workforces.”Readerman says the jury is out on whether there’s a lasting impact on how we work, but he adds that contingency planning now requires the ability to work remotely for extended periods. Among his cloud software picks are            DocuSign      (DOCU), a provider of digital-signature software, and            Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), the videoconferencing company that has been one of the year’s best stocks. “If there was ever doubt about the migration of the enterprise to cloud platforms, Covid-19 has proved its capabilities,” he says.Readerman concedes that Zoom’s valuation looks extreme—the stock trades at 34 times Wall Street’s sales estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2022—but he says there’s an opportunity for Zoom to monetize its surge in new users. He thinks that Zoom can expand beyond videoconferencing to offer a wider range of tools. “Zoom reminds me of AOL when it was everywhere, with ease of use and the freemium model,” he says.Readerman is bullish, too, on data center operators like            Equinix       (EQIX) and            Digital Realty Trust      (DLR). On the more speculative side, he likes their smaller rivals,            CyrusOne      (CONE) and            CoreSite Realty       (COR), which could be consolidation targets. He says that            Equinix      is seeing a surge in traffic to its servers, another sign of the growth of the cloud-computing trend. “Grocery stores are sold out of toilet paper, and we all need more broadband,” he says. Companies like            Equinix,      he adds, are “the critical on/off ramp for internet-based connectivity and commerce.” Rich Greenfield Greenfield, the co-founder of research boutique LightShed Partners, has covered entertainment and media companies for 25 years. His coverage universe was dealing with disruption—the technological kind—long before coronavirus, but the pandemic is creating a set of more serious challenges, with movie theaters and theme parks closed, sports shuttered, and ad budgets crunched. Greenfield notes that 12 of the top 50 TV advertisers are ailing auto makers; another 11 are quick-serve restaurant chains. The lack of sports content is particularly problematic on the advertising front. The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was canceled, and the National Basketball Association season, Major League Baseball, and the Olympics have all been delayed. There is no clarity on when the event calendar will pick up—and when people will be comfortable in public settings. “How long does it last?” Greenfield asks. “Does the stimulus ward off a recession or depression? It’s hard to tell. No one knows how to forecast this.”But people still crave entertainment, and that’s keeping Greenfield bullish on            Netflix      (NFLX). Unlike most content companies, Netflix sells no ads. And while movie and TV production is shut, Netflix has several months of new content ready to go. “They’re in a really strong position relative to their peers,” he says, pointing to            Walt Disney      (DIS), which has been battered on multiple fronts—its ESPN has no sports to show, its theme parks are closed, and it has no open theaters through which to distribute films. The weak ad market, meanwhile, is problematic for Disney’s broadcast and cable properties.Says Greenfield: “More people are using Netflix than ever before.” He notes that the number of subscribers is accelerating, which isn’t surprising given all of the home-bound people with more hours to fill and no sports to watch. He says Netflix will benefit from people switching to more expensive multiple-user plans and from reduced churn, or cancellations. In coming quarters, he says, Netflix will have “higher subscriptions, higher average revenue per user, and better free cash flow than people think.” Greenfield is also bullish on            Twitter      (TWTR), which this past week warned that revenue for its March quarter would be down year over year, as ad budgets fall. But, he notes, Twitter is seeing record usage. While profits and revenue will take a near-term hit, he points out that Twitter can withstand the crisis, with $6.6 billion in cash. And the company is poised to benefit from a crowded events calendar once the virus threat ebbs. “There aren’t enough weekends on the calendar for all the stuff coming down from September through summer 2021,” Greenfield says, with spring sporting events shifted to the fall, a packed film-release schedule, and the November election. “It’s absurd.” And he thinks it will all drive traffic—and ad dollars—to Twitter.  Paul Meeks Meeks wears multiple hats, as a portfolio manager for Independent Solutions Wealth Management, an asset management firm in Williamsville, N.Y., and a manager of The Wireless Fund, a small tech mutual fund. Meeks say that he has been using the recent rally to raise cash, while dabbling in marquee names and “banking proceeds for a better day.” Meeks says that he’s waiting until “earnings estimates are slashed to the bone” before making substantial new commitments. “I need to see them all confess all their sins, and to take down numbers dramatically.” In the meantime, Meeks has been nibbling on megacaps, specifically Amazon and            Alibaba Group Holding      (BABA), both of which he thinks will benefit from the expanded role that e-commerce will play in the post-coronavirus world. Eventually, he says, when earnings estimates reset, he wants to own his “dream team of semiconductor stocks,” including            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD),            Lam Research      (LRCX),            Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing      (TSM),            Micron Technology      (MU), and            Applied Materials      (AMAT), where he expects to go from basically zero to a big overweight. Meanwhile, Meeks is bullish on            Virtu Financial      (VIRT), a New York–based tech-driven financial trading platform. Meeks sees the company as a play on volatility. He notes that Virtu trades for about 10 times earnings and pays a “fairly certain” dividend, currently yielding 4.3%. “When stocks go up endlessly again, and investors are complacent, they become an average company again,” he says. But, for now, Virtu will benefit as long as we continue to see “whipsaw moves in both directions.” Dan Niles Niles is founder and portfolio manager for the Satori Fund, a tech-focused hedge fund. On Feb. 17, just after Apple pulled its March quarter guidance, Niles tweeted that he had 50% of his portfolio short Apple, seven of the company’s suppliers, and        QQQ,      an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. It was a prescient call. Niles remains generally bearish on the market, but there are stocks he likes and owns, particularly around videogames. While Niles thinks the market has exaggerated the impact of a fifth-generation, or 5G, iPhone launch later this year, he sees opportunity in a less-watched product cycle: new videogame consoles from Microsoft and            Sony      (SNE), expected this fall. “They’re going to launch the first new hardware platforms since 2013, and everyone is stuck at home,” he says. “I like them all,” he says of the videogame stocks, including            Zynga      (ZNGA),            Take-Two Interactive Software      (TTWO), and            Electronic Arts      (EA), along with China’s            NetEase      (NTES) and            Tencent Holdings      (700.Hong Kong).Other Niles bets are Amazon, a beneficiary from the shift to e-commerce, and work-at-home play            RingCentral      (RNG), a cloud-based communications provider. Meanwhile, he’s still ready to short Apple again as the stock rallies. For one thing, he says, “I don’t know who is going to feel rich enough to buy an iPhone.” And he wonders why anyone would pay 19 times current earnings for Apple, when other hardware plays like            Dell Technologies      (DELL) and            HP Inc.      (HPQ) trade for just seven times.  Craig Moffett Moffett, founder of the research boutique MoffettNathanson, is the market’s most influential telecom and cable seer. He predicts deep issues for some of the largest companies he covers, notably            AT&T      (T) and            Comcast      (CMCSA), given their exposure to ad-supported content through their respective WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal segments. AT&T and Comcast are getting a boost from their broadband units, but Moffett sees better ways to play that trend.He’s bullish on            Charter Communications      (CHTR) and            Altice USA       (ATUS), both pure plays on the cable business and, therefore, free of ad-supported content worries. Charter is down 13% over the past month. “The fact that Charter has sold off as much as the broader market makes no sense at all,” Moffett says. “The cable companies are simply digital infrastructure providers. They are agnostic about how you can get your video content. And the broadband business is going to be just fine.” He says that Altice, while a little riskier than Charter, is even cheaper. Both companies are seeing demand for faster—and more expensive—broadband plans, with parents and children spending so many hours at home. Moffett thinks that Altice could rally 40% to 50%, while Charter could rise 30% to 40%. Moffett is also bullish on            T-Mobile US      (TMUS), which is about to be a strong No. 3 player in the U.S. wireless market after it closes a pending deal to buy            Sprint      (S). “They’ll be very well positioned, with line of sight to cost savings and margin expansion, and network advantages that should translate into market-share gains for years and years to come,” he says. And while Moffett still sees some risk to the deal’s completion, he thinks that T-Mobile is attractive with or without Sprint.  Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedBoeing      reclaimed its crown as the largest American industrial firm Thursday, cracking the $100 billion market-capitalization threshold again.To say the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has reshaped the industrial marketplace would be an understatement. The changes in market capitalization of industrial firms over the past six or seven weeks tells an interesting story about how the world has changed. Just $100 billion might not seem all that impressive in 2020.            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT) and            Apple      (AAPL), for instance, are each worth more than $1 trillion. But $100 billion is to industrial companies what $1 trillion is to tech firms. Some of the oldest, most famous American companies aren’t valued like today’s tech giants.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      hits its 52-week high on Feb. 12. Back then, there were seven U.S. industrial companies with market capitalizations north of $100 billion—including            Tesla      (TSLA)—and the top 10 were collectively valued at more than $1.2 trillion.Five of the top 10 industrials have aerospace and defense in their corporate DNA: Boeing (BA),            General Electric      (GE),            Lockheed Martin      (LMT),            United Technologies      (UTX), and            Honeywell      (HON). Prior to the pandemic, aerospace and defense was regarded as the best industrial end market. Things are different now: Defense has held up better, but investors’ confidence in consumer air travel has been shaken. Air traffic, historically, doubles every 15 years. Investors are less certain that will happen again now that about 7,000 planes are grounded because no one is traveling. At the market’s nadir, on Monday, no industrial company was worth $100 billion and the group’s value had fallen 43% to less than $700 billion. Boeing ranked eight out of 10 and Tesla was in the top spot. After the electric-vehicle pioneer, railroads and logistics—represented by            United Parcel Service      (UPS)—were the largest firms. Tesla, of course, is a car company. Auto makers are officially consumer discretionary firms. But they are some of the largest manufacturers in the world. Tesla also makes batteries and solar panels and owns a global EV charging network. Things change quickly in this market. As of Thursday’s closing price, there is only one $100 billion industrial: Boeing. The value of the group is up 28% to about $800 billion. The value of the aerospace and defense components are up more than 40%. The $2 trillion government stimulus package, passed by the Senate recently, has billions for air travel. That has helped calm investors. It has also, very likely, taken the worst outcomes for the aviation sector off the table.Despite the bounce, the industrials with the most commercial aerospace exposure remain down about 33% from the February market peak. The other largest industrials are off about 19%. Things continue to change quickly. The        S&P 500      is off 3.5% and Boeing is down more than 11% in early Friday trading, giving back some of a five-day gain that sent shares up about 90%. Investors can expect more volatility from industrial stocks in coming weeks.

0,"Companies with higher environmental, social, and governance factors have outperformed the broad market since its February peak, contradicting views that the trend is just a bull-market phenomenon.In a new report, companies with better ESG risk profiles beat those with lower ones since the        S&P 500 peaked on Feb. 19, according to a report by Sara Mahaffy, U.S. equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Meanwhile, two-thirds of actively managed sustainable equity funds were beating their benchmark in March, Mahaffy pointed out. They were helped by the fact that they were underweight in energy and financials; held higher-quality stocks as measured by higher returns on equity, invested capital, and assets; and they tend to own popular S&P 500 names that have held up better, such as            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT),            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Visa      (V), and            Apple      (AAPL). Flows into ESG exchange-traded funds stayed positive into March, Mahaffy wrote.“This is not a bubble or a trend,” says Erika Karp, CEO of Cornerstone Capital, an investment advisor with a sustainable focus. “ESG analysis is way more important than we could have imagined.”RBC’s findings were echoed in a report by BofA Global Research strategists led by Savita Subramanian. The report showed that since the Feb. 19 peak, stocks with ESG scores in the top quintile outperformed those that ranked poorly by five to 10 percentage points in the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, stocks with lower ESG scores were seeing bigger cuts to earnings forecasts. In Asia, BofA wrote, the phenomenon of ESG outperformance didn’t hold, partly because China and India outperformed Australia and Japan. That was partly because China, in particular, “has had better Covid-19 timing and containment,” the team pointed out.“ESG is a bear market necessity, not a bull market luxury,” BofA wrote, disputing recent critiques suggesting that in times of stress, investors and companies would allocate all resources to staying afloat, and that an ESG focus was a luxury.Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, says that it was possible that the push for companies to make ESG disclosures could slow down, particularly disclosure of “nitpicky” ESG factors. “But big issues like climate change will continue to resonate with investors,” and company disclosures about environmental practices will continue to proliferate, he says.Bud Sturmak, co-chief investment officer of Perigon Wealth Management, notes that sustainable investing is being “mainstreamed,” with ratings firms, central banks, insurers, and corporate lenders incorporating ESG risks into their assessments. “There is now a clear and direct line from a company’s ESG performance to cost of capital, profitability, and share-price volatility,” he says.Whatever the critiques, “the underpinnings of sustainable investing remain alive and well—despite the collapse in oil prices and the fact that many governments’ green growth agendas could be pushed back in time,” Sustainable Market Strategies wrote. “In fact, current market pricing of several ESG-relevant investment themes suggests that investors are still confident that the future will be a more sustainable one.”  Write to Leslie P.

0,"Apple      shares have retaken the $1 trillion market-value level, as its stock rallies along with the broad market. On Monday, the company’s market value closed the day below $1 trillion level for the first time since September.But with shares up 6.5% Tuesday, to $238.98, Apple’s market value is now at $1.05 trillion. The        S&P 500      was up 6.4% on Tuesday afternoon. Apple is the second-largest U.S. company by market value, trailing only            Microsoft      (MSFT) at $1.13 trillion. There’s little question that Apple (ticker: AAPL) is feeling significant impact from the coronavirus pandemic. More than a month ago, Apple warned that it wouldn’t reach its previous March quarter revenue guidance due to both supply chain and demand issues in China. The picture has since shifted. There are signs of improvement in China, with production normalizing and Apple’s China retail stores reopened. But the rapid global spread of the virus raises questions about near-term demand, in particular, for iPhones. All of Apple’s retail stores outside China are now closed, and U.S. carriers are closing many of their own stores. That said, expectations are still high for the first generation of 5G-capable iPhones, which investors are expecting to arrive later this year.Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar this morning trimmed his price target on Apple shares to $260, from $343, while repeating his Overweight rating. Kumar chopped his financial outlook on the company, reducing his fiscal 2020 earnings-per-share estimate to $12.32 a share from $13.59, while trimming his fiscal 2021 view to $14.63 from $15.71. But he remains a bull on the stock. “We believe Apple’s diversified revenue stream should provide benefits in both the near and long-term, and we see 5G driving a major product cycle refresh across the company’s product line,” he wrote in a research note. “Given the suspected second-half launch, we believe the number of Apple 5G phones could be less impacted than others currently on the market today. Regardless of overall impact, we believe Apple is considered the cream of the crop for mobile phones...Longer-term, we envision the company’s other product sets could have 5G connectivity capabilities, which could drive additional product set refreshes down the line.”Kumar also points to the strength of the company’s balance sheet. “In times like these, we tend to prefer companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to generate solid free cash flow,” he wrote. “In our view, Apple is one of the strongest companies in our realm in this regard, as it has over $100 billion in net cash. Apple has also generated nearly $64 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months...Largely speaking, we believe Apple is well-prepared financially for an uncertain environment.” He also notes that Apple has $60 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization and could use the recent pullback to repurchase shares.

All Rights ReservedThe last time the S&P 500’s total dividends declined from the previous year was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Expect that to happen this year. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, says an overall decline in dividend payments in 2020 “is very feasible” due to the coronavirus pandemic. That warning marks a drastic turnabout from the start of the year, when Silverblatt was expecting dividend increases of about 9% for S&P 500 companies.Among the S&P 500 companies suspending their payouts so far this year:            Delta Air Lines      (ticker: DAL),            Boeing      (BA),            Ford Motor      (F) and            Freeport-McMoRan      (FCX). Dividend cuts were imposed by energy companies            Occidental Petroleum      (OXY) and            Apache      (APA).“More cuts and suspensions are expected, as companies move to limit expenses as cash-flow declines,” Silverblatt said in a note Tuesday.Among those companies that previously put through dividend increases in April are            Exxon Mobil      (XOM),            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ) and            Procter & Gamble      (PG). Investors will be watching these companies, and many others, closely to gauge trends. Dividends are considered an important signal for a company’s priorities.The top five S&P 500 dividend payers in terms of cash outlays are            Microsoft      (MSFT),            AT&T      (T), Exxon Mobil,            Apple      (AAPL), and            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM).Meanwhile, buyback suspensions have been more prevalent and are likely to increase. Among those suspending buybacks are eight large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase and            Bank of America      (BAC), and various other companies, including            Nordstrom      (JWN) and AT&T.First-quarter “buybacks should be significantly down, as the quarter was already half over when the virus hit the U.S,” Silverblatt said. Looking further out, he says, the second quarter and full year are expected to be dismal on buybacks. For context, S&P 500 companies bought back $728.7 billion of shares in 2019, down nearly 10% from the record $806.4 billion in 2018.There is also mounting political pressure to curtail stock buybacks. President Trump has said that any federal bailout money shouldn’t go to buybacks, and Democratic Presidential front-runner Joe Biden has called for a suspension of the practice for 12 months.

All Rights ReservedThe measures announced by the Federal Reserve in recent weeks to combat the coronavirus crisis are unprecedented in size and scope because the crisis itself is unlike any other the world has faced. While they build on the central bank’s response to the 2008-’09 financial crisis, they vastly exceed steps taken more than a decade ago to shore up the faltering U.S. economy.This time around, moreover, there is no debate about the need for government intervention. In 2008—and well beyond—dissenters questioned the wisdom and fairness of bailing out the corporate sector, and especially the nation’s banks.In setting up a dizzying array of alphabet-soup facilities to buy bonds and take other steps that expand upon programs introduced during the financial crisis, the Fed has extended its reach even further into the economy. And it has taken the central bank even farther afield from its traditional policy tool of buying government securities, the avenue through which it would pump funds into the financial system, which then would channel money into the private economy.At the same time, the Fed’s efforts now are coordinated to an even greater extent with fiscal policies to support an economy that slammed to a near-halt. Ironically, in echoes of 2008, Congressional wrangling is holding up a massive stimulus bill in the Senate, just as the measure to authorize the Troubled Assets Relief Program initially failed, with similarly negative consequences for the stock market.Based on Monday morning’s announcement of an array of new measures, the Fed has extended support directly to the corporate bond market and the municipal bond market. It has also agreed to lend directly to small businesses. That’s in addition to expanding its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities in unlimited fashion, compared with the $500 billion and $200 billion originally announced when the Fed slashed its key federal-funds rate target to near-zero on Sunday, March 19.As James Bianco, head of Bianco Research, put it, “At first blush, it looks like they are nationalizing financial markets, except for equities and high-yield” bonds. Alternately, it appears the Fed has reached its Mario Draghi moment, echoing the former head of the European Central Bank in effectively declaring it will do whatever it takes to cushion the blows likely to result from the virtual shutdown of many sectors of the U.S. economy due to the spread of the coronavirus. The economic fallout from the virus crisis is already apparent. Economists at major banks are leapfrogging each other to estimate the extent of the decline in the U.S. economy in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley economists predict that gross domestic product could collapse at a 30.1% annual rate in the period; that compares with an 8.4% downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008 during the financial crisis, and an 11.1% contraction in 1946, with the end of World War II expenditures.The current crisis has been likened to wartime, and rightly so, given the upheaval in ordinary lives and household spending, and the huge disruption to American business. But a strong wartime economy, greased by fiscal stimulus, put Americans to work, even if their spending was curbed by rationing.Layoffs now are mounting from businesses that can’t operate with employees working from home. In but one stark example cited by Torsten Sløk, chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities, bookings at online restaurant-reservation services have fallen 100%, to zero.The fiscal-stimulus bill, now held up in the Senate, would provide an array of assistance totaling more than $2 trillion. According to Cowen’s Washington analyst, Chris Krueger, even this understates the total. The $500 billion “slush fund” to help industry, as he calls it, can be leveraged 10 times by the Fed through the various lending facilities it has announced. That would come to an astounding $7 trillion, or almost 10 times the stimulus provided in 2009 to fight the Great Recession after the financial crisis.Why such an unprecedented program would be necessary after 10-year economic expansion accompanied by a soaring stock market and record-tying low employment of 3.5% is perhaps an obvious question. After all, Corporate America supposedly had huge cash reserves, while U.S. households were flush from their equity holdings and the post-financial-crisis recovery in the value of their home.Yet corporate cash is largely concentrated in a few high-profile companies such as            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Microsoft      (MSFT), and            Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK.A), each of which has more than $100 billion in liquid assets on its balance sheet. Cash-rich companies generally risked becoming targets of activist investors, who would press management to return the cash to shareholders through stock buybacks, Sløk noted.With interest rates at historic lows, in part because of central-bank bond purchases, it was a no-brainer for many corporate-finance officers to borrow cheaply to repurchase stock. Share buybacks reduce share count and thereby increase earnings per share and, in turn, the share price.Many of the Fed’s new programs have been spurred by the resulting loss of financial flexibility in the current crisis. In addition to permitting the purchase of corporate bonds, these programs have revived the central bank’s support of the commercial paper market and money-market funds. At the same time, the Fed has extended its support to the state and local sectors by buying a range of municipal securities and tax-free money funds. Will all this work to stabilize the economy?“Relief for business and consumers may keep the economy afloat through the lockdowns now coming into force in the U.S.,” writes Jonas Golterman of Capital Economics in a client note. “And the Fed’s efforts will also help cushion the blow and shore up the financial system, limiting the risk that the pandemic triggers a full-blown financial crisis.”But only clear signs of success to bring the pandemic under control will bring about stability and recovery in the economy and the financial markets, he concludes.Previous crises have had financial and economic causes, and thus their cures were financial and economic in nature. Never before have monetary and fiscal policy makers had to deal with a public health problem which necessitated bringing the economy to a virtual halt. And so the Fed is acting like never before to provide credit in every corner to mitigate the economic fallout from the coronavirus. That buys crucial time during a period of self-quarantine. But it doesn’t provide a cure. Write to Randall W.

1,"The stock market’s coronavirus-inspired selloff over the past month has coincided with widening bid-ask spreads on most stocks. Combine that with sharply higher trading volumes, and already huge daily swings are amplified. The        S&P 500      has had seven days straight of moves of at least 4%, including three sessions of swings greater than 9%. That is a lot of volatility.A measure of market liquidity—or the lack thereof—designed by a group of analysts at Goldman Sachs illustrates how it has evaporated for U.S. stocks over the past month.“Liquidity is difficult to measure,” the analysts wrote. “We use an illiquidity ratio, which is defined as the 1-month average of the daily absolute value of returns divided by the dollars of trading volumes (capturing the illiquidity premium in U.S. equities). This metric exhibits a high correlation with bid-ask spreads since 2013.”Currently, Goldman’s illiquidity ratio is at the highest level relative to the past three years than it has been since the volatile trading that took place during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.The analysts found that during past liquidity shocks, stocks with higher relative liquidity outperformed those with lower liquidity, in what they call a “flight-to-liquidity.” It also helps explain why small-capitalization stocks have sold off much more than large-cap stocks in recent weeks, because they tend to be less liquid.“Low liquidity stocks have lagged during previous S&P 500 corrections and have lagged by 11 percentage points during the current bear market (-42% vs. -31%),” they wrote. “We expect high-liquidity stocks will continue to outperform until the S&P 500 reaches its near-term trough.”Over the long term, however, buying stocks with less liquidity can be a profitable strategy, as investors can earn a premium for accepting higher liquidity risk.“A strategy of buying illiquid stocks and selling liquid stocks has generated a 4% annualized return since 1976, with a 63% annual hit rate of outperformance,” the analysts wrote. “The factor has historically outperformed during correction rebounds.”Until that rebound arrives, however, the Goldman Sachs analysts identified the stocks with the highest and lowest illiquidity ratios in the        Russell 1000       over the past year. The low-liquidity stocks tend to be much smaller and trade at a meaningful valuation discount than the higher liquidity basket—which is topped by giants            Amazon.com       (ticker: AMZN),            Apple       (AAPL),            Microsoft       (MSFT),            Facebook       (FB), and            Alphabet       (GOOGL).

0,"How a company’s stock reacts to its earnings report first and foremost depends on the quality of the results. But how the numbers come in relative to analysts’ expectations can be even more indicative of the way the stock reacts. And when investors have a strong view on a company’s upcoming trajectory going into an earnings report, any deviation can mean a sharp move in a stock’s price—sometimes seemingly counter to the actual reported results.For example, last Wednesday,            Facebook      (ticker: FB) posted 25% revenue growth and 8% profit growth for its latest quarter—both healthy increases for a company of its size and ahead of Wall Street consensus going into the report. But the social media giant had a high bar to hurdle. Facebook stock had well outperformed the market since it last reported earnings on Oct. 30, rising 19% versus a 7% gain for the        S&P 500      index. Just in the month before reporting, the stock and index rose 7% and 1%, respectively. Facebook also outpaced other technology stocks.That short-term optimism was clearly overblown. Facebook stock dropped over 6% on Thursday.There are 90 S&P 500 components releasing results this week. These are the ones that have climbed the most in the past month through Friday’s close, while the S&P 500 has returned less than 2%:Source: FactSetA couple of the biggest winners going into their earnings reports this week are defense stocks, like            L3Harris Technologies      (ticker: LHX), or suppliers of components to defense companies, like            TransDigm Group      (TDG). They both got a big bump in early January as Middle East tensions spiked, and escalating conflict between the U.S. and Iran looked likely. Management might be asked this week if they see a positive impact on their business going forward.Other stocks jumped due to specific one-time factors.            NortonLifeLock      (NLOK) saw its shares rise recently after it declared a special dividend.            Paycom Software      (PAYC) was added to the S&P 500 index in its latest reshuffling and saw buying from index funds.The stocks that have outperformed sharply over the past month without a clear catalyst—            Motorola Solutions      (MSI) or            FleetCor Technologies      (FLT)—are the ones to watch the most closely when they report this week. Investors are expressing their optimism by buying shares, and could still be disappointed by what is otherwise a strong report.Conversely, stocks that go into their earnings sitting on heavy recent losses might only need a slightly better-than-expected or in-line report to see a positive reaction.Here are this week’s reporters that have dropped the most over the past month:Source: FactSetHow a stock has performed before its earnings report of course can’t alone determine how the market will react to new information.

1,"For Don Wordell and his family, a weekend getaway often means piling into their Cirrus SR22 single-engine airplane. “It opens up your world,” says Wordell, who took up flying about a decade ago. The plane’s whole-body parachute, which carries the plane and its passengers, gives the father of two extra peace of mind, though he takes every precaution to make sure he never has to deploy it. “Whether you’re flying on a beautiful day or in a rainstorm, you stick with your objective and follow a checklist to get you there,” says Wordell, 48. He applies the same philosophy to piloting the $3.1 billion Virtus Ceredex Mid-Cap Value Equity fund (ticker: SAMVX), which he has managed since its 2001 inception. Over that time, the fund has returned an average of 10.8% a year even after factoring in a relatively high 1.38% expense ratio for A shares, which also come with a 5.75% front-end load. Its returns by calendar year—which, admittedly, are just a construct—can be jarring. For instance, in 2010 the fund returned 27.2%, beating 94% of its category peers. The next year, it reported a total return of negative 7.5%, besting only 16% of peers, though in 2012 it rebounded with a 21.4% return and ranked in the group’s top decile. Over the past three years, the fund is up 10.8% annually, better than 93% of its            Morningstar      peers.  Read more: 6 Mid-Cap Stocks With Sustainable Dividends Look Inviting Wordell’s investment checklist is straightforward. “It’s dividends, valuation, and fundamentals,” he says. “All three of those have to come together for a stock to be eligible to be purchased, and if any one of those three criteria is violated, the stock is sold.”That process is consistent across the three funds managed by Ceredex, where Wordell is one of three managers—one for each fund. The funds draw on research from a team of eight sector analysts. “I love the mid-cap space because it’s the information opportunity of small-cap investing, but the liquidity of large,” says Wordell, who started his investment career in 1996 as an analyst at the Orlando, Fla.–based firm. While central Florida isn’t exactly a hub of asset management, Orlando’s massive convention center and nearby theme parks make Ceredex a popular stop for company chiefs in town for conferences and family vacations. Before a company gets to that stage, however, it must fit Wordell’s criteria.“Every stock in the portfolio pays a dividend, not because we’re yield investors but because we like the characteristics of dividend payers,” Wordell says. From a roster of about 1,200 medium-size companies that pay dividends, Wordell and his colleagues look for stocks trading at low valuations, compared with their peers and their own history. They further cull that list to names whose upside potential they think is twice that of downside risk.One of Wordell’s favorite stories is            Energizer Holdings      (ENR), which has seen its shares tumble over concerns that two major acquisitions—Rayovac and a Global Auto Care portfolio that includes Armor All—will be a drain on earnings. Wordell sees an excellent management team building a consumer-staples platform. Plus, the stock, at around $40, has a 3% dividend yield and trades at 12 times fiscal-2020 earnings, which ends in September. “We think the fundamentals will be much better than what the market is discounting now,” says Wordell, who thinks the stock deserves to trade at $70 within two years. Note: Holdings as of 6/28; All returns through 7/23; five- and 10-year returns are annualized.Sources: Morningstar; Virtus Investment PartnersMotorola Solutions      (MSI) is also a misunderstood stock, Wordell says. The company, which split from Motorola in 2011, focuses on mission-critical communications, such as hand-held radios for first responders. Wordell added the holding in 2017, when it traded at 10 times earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization, or Ebitda, as investors assumed that LTE cellular networks would make many of its products obsolete. Wordell thought those fears were naive. Search-and-rescue workers venture into places without cellular coverage, crowded stadiums don’t have reliable signals, and cell coverage is often the first to go in natural disasters. The U.S. government is increasing its spending on first-responder networks that use Motorola Solutions services and devices, Wordell says. Also, the company has “made some very savvy acquisitions” that allow it to do everything from video surveillance to data storage. Although the stock now trades about 16 times 2020 earnings, Wordell still thinks that it’s a bargain.It’s a similar story for managed-care company            Humana      (HUM), which the fund first bought in April 2016. Wordell saw a great company that derives most of its revenue from its Medicare Advantage plans. “You have this huge demographic tailwind for Humana, with 10,000 people a day turning 65 for the next 15 years,” he says. The stock slipped in late 2018 as the 2020 presidential election cycle kicked off, and fell further this spring when Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed ending all private health insurance. So Wordell doubled the fund’s position in Humana, recently its largest holding. The stock has since recovered to around $280, but is still inexpensive to Wordell at 15 times earnings. While he isn’t counting on it, he says that Humana could become a takeover target—similar to            CVS Health      (CVS) taking over Aetna. In the meantime, it’s on track to improve earnings 20% this year, he says, and should continue growing at a double-digit pace for “as far as the eye can see.” For Don Wordell and his family, a weekend getaway often means piling into their Cirrus SR22 single-engine airplane.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Trade negotiations between the U.S. and China quickly went from smooth to rocky over the past week. Markets followed suit: After a slow but steady rise over the last four months, stocks and other risky assets have stumbled on tariff threats and counter-threats from the world’s largest two economies. The        S&P 500      index is down more than 3% this week, while Chinese stocks are off even more. Meanwhile, safe haven assets like gold or the Japanese Yen are up, and volatility has spiked.President Donald Trump was poised to increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods imported to the U.S., from the current 10% to 25%, unless the two sides reached an agreement by 12:01 a.m. E.T. China has promised to retaliate. While the next few days could prove critical, investors can begin preparing now for both possible scenarios—escalation or agreement.Dennis DeBusschere, a senior managing director at Evercore ISI, sees the S&P 500 continuing to fall if a deal isn’t reached quickly, as increased tariffs threaten to dent global economic growth. That should also be accompanied by greater volatility, which has spent most of 2019 at very low levels.In a note to clients Thursday, he recommended an options trade that captures both scenarios: “To take advantage of that situation the EISI Options Team recommends buying a         SPDR S&P 500      ETF May 283 put that would pay off if the trade war escalates and a iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN May 31.5 put that would benefit from lower volatility if an agreement is reached.”Puts increase in value when a stock price declines, while calls appreciate when it rises. Read more: How to Play the New Trade War Turmoil With Stock OptionsWith the heightened risk of a deterioration in trade talks, Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at Wells Fargo, advises positioning similar to what worked in the second quarter of 2018— another period of threatened tariff escalations. During that quarter, U.S.-domestic exposed small cap stocks rose, while Chinese shares sold off on fears of a trade war’s impact on the Chinese economy. He advises buying Jun 41.5 puts on the        iShares China Large-Cap      ETF (FXI), and selling Jun 155 puts on the        iShares Russell 2000 ETF      (IWM). The strategy will pay off as long as U.S. small caps outperform Chinese stocks.On a sector level, U.S. industrials and technology stocks have both the greatest reliance on Chinese manufacturing and customer concentration in China. Semiconductor-related firms are most reliant on China as a customer, with about a third of their revenues there, according to Keith Parker, a strategist at UBS. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor      ETF (SOXX) is off more than 6% this week. Consumer durables and apparel firms, meanwhile, are most reliant on Chinese production. If 25% tariffs are extended to all Chinese goods, the duties could exceed 11% of output for those companies.A team of equity strategists at Barclays identified the 50 U.S. stocks most exposed to negative effects of the U.S.-China trade war, and are therefore most likely to underperform if matters escalate. They include            Hasbro      (HAS) and            Mattel      (MAT), which each count over 80% of their sales as imports from China. Other particularly exposed consumer goods names include            Whirlpool      (WHR),            Under Armour      (UA),            Tapestry      (TPR),            Foot Locker      (FL),            Capri Holdings      (CPRI), and            Nike      (NKE). All have at least 45% of their sales that could be impacted by new tariffs. Other companies on Barclays’ list include            Apple      (AAPL),            Qualcomm      (QCOM),            HP      (HPQ),            Motorola Solutions      (MSI), and          Harris      (HRS).Those may be the stocks to most avoid in a trade war scenario, but the damage will be more widespread, according to Alain Bokobza, head of global asset allocation at Societe Generale.“In the case of an escalation in the U.S./China trade war, there won’t be any winner in equity investing as lower growth expectations—and not a recession in the immediate aftermath of the 25% tariffs—will be discounted in asset prices,” he wrote in a report on Wednesday. Recent Chinese monetary easing and fiscal stimulus should provide some support for Chinese equities, but they remain the most exposed to U.S. tariff increases. Bokobza estimates that 25% tariffs on all Chinese goods sent to the U.S. would shave an entire percentage point from Chinese GDP growth, which recently came in at about a 6% annualized rate. The        Shanghai Composite Index      has dropped more than 7% this week in anticipation.Of course, another approach may be to sit tight for now and see how things play out. Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, suggests doing just that. “Wild swings caused by criss-crossing headlines makes doing nothing the right choice for most investors,” he said on Thursday. For investors with excess cash, the past week may have made some stocks more attractive.“Many investors have been waiting for a pull back to deploy capital that was otherwise late to the 2019 rally—now you have your chance,” Cox said. “No one really knows how the trade situation will turn out, but everyone should be able to figure out that if you liked            Microsoft      MSFT at $130, you should love it at $125.” Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.comTrade negotiations between the U.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Many of the 500 stocks in the index were down Thursday morning, dragging the index down as low as 1.5%. But not every stock was losing. Here are some of Thursday morning’s best performers, and as you can see, most had their own idiosyncratic reasons for rising.Tapestry      stock (ticker: TPR) was leading the pack Thursday morning. Its shares shot up 9% after releasing an upbeat quarterly earnings report. Nektar Therapeutics      (NKTR) reported a smaller loss than Wall Street expected after the closing bell Wednesday, and shares were up 6.2% to $35.01 Thursday morning.Perrigo       (PRGO) announced it had reached a deal to buy privately held oral care company Ranir Global Holdings for $750 million in cash, or $685 million including cash tax benefits. Perrigo stock was up 4% to $51.18 Mylan       stock (MYL) was up 3.3% to $22.61. But don’t call it a comeback. Its shares fell 23.8%, or $6.73, on Tuesday after the drugmaker reported downbeat first quarter revenue. Fox Corp.      (FOX) was up 3.23% to $38.01.

0,"Two lesser-known tech companies are surging today, and their bright results should give heart to investors in many industries, not just information technology.One of them is wireless-tag technology firm Impinj (PI), up $4.35, or 32%, at $17.93, after the company yesterday afternoon reported Q1 revenue that topped analysts’ expectations and forecast this quarter’s revenue higher, after three disappointing quarters in a row.A related company is Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), maker of wireless tracking systems that, in fact, use some of Impinj’s technology. Its shares are surging, up $14.45, or 11%, at $151.93, after the company this morning reported Q1 revenue and profit that easily surpassed expectations, forecast this quarter much higher, and raised its outlook for this year’s sales growth.Whats important to know about the duo is that their technologies are used to identify and track goods across a range of industries and practices, from retail to health care.For example, Zebra’s barcode labels are used on every package that Amazon.com (AMZN) ships, and its handheld computers are used when you sign with FedEx (FDX) or UPS (UPS) for a package. Impinj’s tags can go on warehouse palettes and individual retail goods.The two companies are not a proxy, by any means, for global commerce, but their success can be considered important indicators that companies are investing in tools for their sale of goods, which suggests a generally bright outlook by those customers as far as their own sales.Impinj is harder to gauge as an indicator, because its sales have been less consistent, as indicated above. But with sales approaching a billion dollars per quarter at Zebra, its significance as an indicator of commerce should be taken seriously.Zebra’s chief executive, Anders Gustafsson, was kind enough to take a few minutes to talk with me by phone this afternoon.Saying he was “certainly very pleased with the results,” Gustafsson told me that all of the companys product categories “did very well,” including not only barcode-scanner printers and the supplies to generate those labels, but also the tech infrastructure to tag items and then read those tags, such as WiFi network systems, and also handheld mobile computers used by store associates in retail to look up a product while on the store floor.Moreover, Gustafsson said the macro-economic climate that he observed is “overall quite favorable.” Asked if any of the headlines about ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China should be of concern, the CEO said Zebra saw nothing at all remiss. “We havent seen any impact,” he said. “Im not sure if those are Black Swans or White Swans, but Im not aware of anything of consequence that came up for us.”As for Zebra itself, this year marks a renewed focus on revenue and profit, said Gustafsson, after the company spent much of 2017 focusing on its integration of all the infrastructure technology that once belonged to Motorola Solutions (MSI), which Zebra bought from Motorola in late 2014 for $3.5 billion.Gustafsson hopes as the integration work recedes into the background, investors will pay more attention to the little known company thats behind all those Amazon packages.“We have joked that we have been around for a long time, but we have been hiding in plain sight,” he said.

1," MKM Partners We cover 11 communications-equipment companies with September quarters.We foresee five with potential downside to consensus estimates (            Acacia Communications      (ticker: ACIA),            F5 Networks      (FFIV),            Juniper Networks      (JNPR),            Motorola Solutions      (MSI),          Nokia      (NOK)), four that are likely to be in line (            Adtran      (ADTN),            Infinera      (INFN), Oclaro (OCLR),            Viavi Solutions      (VIAV)) and only two that should beat (            Arista Networks      (ANET),            Lumentum Holdings      (LITE)).Arista (rated at Neutral, $150 fair-value estimate) fundamentals are great but estimate inflation and valuation are concerns. We think Arista is likely to solidly exceed our/consensus revenue/gross margin/earnings-per-share estimates of $413 million/62.7%/$1.11 and $418 million/63.3%/$1.19, respectively, when it reports on Nov. 2. According to our checks, the company is doing very well in 100G Ethernet Switching with Cloud Titans, and other larger Cloud Service Providers and Enterprises. The company has a demonstrated track record of beating revenue and margins estimates, and then guiding fairly conservatively, especially when it comes to margins. We expect the fourth-quarter guidance to be in line with consensus at $447 million/63.4%/$1.27. The consensus fourth-quarter estimates are above our published estimates at $426 million/63.2%/$1.18. We remain very positive on Arista’s fundamentals, but have a Neutral rating because of valuation. Our competitors have been introducing higher and higher estimates in order to justify higher and higher price targets. The stock is currently trading at 32 times 2018 consensus EPS excluding cash, which we find to be a very rich multiple, even for a company as strong as Arista.Lumentum (rated at Buy, $66 price target) should guide better than consensus due to 3-D Sensing. We expect Lumentum to report fiscal first quarter (ended September) in line with our/consensus revenue EPS estimates at $256 million/55 cents and $255 million/53 cents, respectively. Roughly $45 million of the quarter’s revenue should come from vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for 3-D Sensing, while the rest of the business is likely to be down a few percentage points sequentially due to demand from China finding the bottom in the third calendar quarter. We think there should be meaningful upside in the second fiscal quarter (ending December) guidance versus our/consensus at $343 million/96 cents and $347 million/$1.00, respectively, driven by 3-D. There looks to be about $125 million of 3-D revenue baked into the fiscal-second-quarter estimates, but it appears the company should actually be able to deliver $150 million-plus of 3-D sales in the December quarter. -- Michael Genovese The opinions contained in Investors’ Soapbox in no way represent those of Barrons.com or Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Dell Technologies      and its majority-owned subsidiary            VMware      have both withdrawn their financial guidance, citing uncertainties about their businesses created by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Both companies made their announcements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Dell (ticker: DELL) said in its filing that it is seeing “heightened interest in work from home solutions and continuing execution in its global supply chain, and remains confident in its liquidity position,” but that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operations for the current fiscal year.” Dell had previously projected revenue for its February 2021 fiscal year of $92 billion to $95 billion, with profits of $5.90 to $6 a share. At the time, Dell said the outlook didn’t reflect any potential impact from the virus.Likewise, VMware (VMW) said in its own SEC filing that it is “unable to predict the extent to which the global Covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact its business operations, financial performance and results of operation,” and therefore it is withdrawing its previous guidance for both the May quarter and the February 2021 fiscal year. The company’s previous guidance had been for full-year revenue of $12.05 billion, with May-quarter revenues of $2.73 billion.On Thursday, PC-related stocks got a boost from some bullish comments after the close on Wednesday from memory chip company            Micron Technology      (MU), which said that it was seeing a boost in demand from strong PC sales as more people upgrade their systems to handle extended periods of working and studying from home. Dell’s announcement removes some of the shine from yesterday’s optimism.Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong points out in a research note Friday that while many semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have withdrawn guidance in recent weeks, many hardware companies have not, such as            HP Inc.      (HPQ),            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Lenovo Group      (0992.Hong Kong), and            Pure Storage      (PSTG). His conclusion is that the announcement “was not entirely unexpected given market conditions.” But Ong still likes Dell shares, asserting that the company has “several underappreciated offsets,” including market share gains, downside protection given a low valuation, and deleveraging potential. He keeps his Buy rating on the stock.Dell stock is down 7.2%, to $39.48, in recent trading, while VMware is down 8.2%, to $114.48. Dell rival HP Inc. is off 6.9%, to $16.72. Micron is down 3.3%, to $43.30. The        S&P 500      is down 3%. Write to Eric J.

The three major U.S. stock-market indexes climbed back to near the break-even mark despite news that Chinese officials reported a dramatic increase in the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus. Near midday, the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was down 52 points, or 0.2%. The        S&P 500      and the        Nasdaq Composite      were a touch within positive territory. That marks a recovery from the levels seen in premarket trading, when futures on the Dow and S&P 500 were both down 0.7%. The Nasdaq had lost 0.9%. Midday Movers Applied Materials      (ticker: AMAT) rose 5.4% after it beat analysts’ second-quarter earnings expectations and provided guidance that soothed worries about the coronavirus’s impact on its business.Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) gained 4.9%. The payment-processor posted adjusted earnings per share that exceeded even the highest forecast on Wall Street. Equifax      (EFX) was up 4.4%. The credit-rating and data company said sales and earnings per share came in ahead of expectations. NetApp      (NTAP) fell 9.7%. The company cut its full-year revenue guidance and announced the resignation of its CFO. Kraft Heinz      (KHC) dropped 8.7% after it posted below-expectations fourth-quarter sales as price increases in the U.S. led consumers to cut back on purchases.

0,"The Dogs of the Dow beat stock market averages during the decade just ended. What’s more, Barron’s found that “small dogs” offer investors superior dividend yields without sacrificing too much return. How do fast dogs—the stocks with the fastest dividend growth—perform? As it turns out, pretty well. That’s a good boy. We’re a little obsessed with dogs. There is good reason though. The Dogs of the Dow is a time-tested strategy that buys the 10 highest dividend yielding stocks in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      each year. It’s a simple, repeatable strategy and it has worked. A strategy like that is the Holy Grail for investors. The success of the Dow Dogs is also what led Barron’s to dive into other simple, repeatable—and potentially winning—investment strategies. The Small Dogs are the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Russell 2000 small capitalization index with market values over $1 billion. Small-cap stocks are typically more volatile than larger companies. We showed investors cut some of the risk of owing small stocks while receiving much higher than average dividend yields. Now for the greyhounds. The Fast Dogs strategy looks at companies growing dividend payouts at the fastest rate. The        S&P 500      was our sample set. Fast Dogs just nosed out the        S&P 500      over the past three years. Outperforming in 2017, underperforming in 2018 and, essentially, matching the market in 2019. A longer historic look would be helpful, but dividend growth data is harder to come by than just dividend yields. Barron’s suspects two fundamental reasons Fast Dogs might work over the long run. First, dividend growth demonstrates to investors the future looks bright. Higher payouts are a powerful signal to investors. What’s more, investors like dividends and more money attracts more investors. The Fast Dogs for 2020 are:            Pioneer Natural Resources      (ticker: PXD),            TechnipFMC      (FTI),            Thermo Fisher Scientific      (TMO),            Newmont      (NEM),            Cimarex Energy      (XEC),            NetApp      (NTAP),            Juniper Networks      (JNPR),            Cognizant Technology Solutions      (CTSH),            Lam Research      (LRCX) and            Progressive      (PGR). That’s a nice mix of stocks across several sectors. Deciding what stocks to buy can be hard. Learning to construct a portfolio of stocks can be hard too. But looking at different factors, such as dividend growth, can help investors screen in, or screen out, various stocks and strategies. Finding a unique strategy is entertaining—and rewarding too.

0,"Traditional dividend havens such as utilities and real estate investment trusts are expected to continue that role, with yields in the 3% range this year. Those looking for more robust dividend growth should consider sectors such as health care and technology. The health and tech sectors in the S&P 500 index are expected to notch the best dividend growth this year on a per share basis, 10% for health care and 9% for tech, according to consensus estimates. Those two sectors are expected to increase their earnings this year by roughly 10%, compared with mid-single digits for utilities and REITs.IHS Markit,      a financial-data firm, expects U.S. dividends paid out to total a record $663 billion this year, up 7.2% from 2019’s levels—but below the 7.9% gain the previous year. That 2020 estimate, which excludes special dividends, covers the entire U.S. stock market, including the S&P 500.These are consensus estimates. *Estimated growth compared to previous year.Sources: Bloomberg, FactSet,Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchThe slower dividend growth “is mainly attributed to a slowdown in earnings growth when compared with 2018 earnings growth, which was boosted by tax cuts,” IHS Markit says in its 2020 forecast.  Still, there should be plenty of dividend growth this year across various sectors, starting with health care. Dividends usually grow in line with earnings, and the health-care sector, from large pharmaceutical firms to a major prescription-drug distributor, offers plenty of strength. “The amount of money spent on prescription drugs has nearly doubled over the past three decades as pharmaceuticals sales and profit margins have ballooned,” the forecast says.The consensus earnings estimate for the            Health Care Select Sector SPDR       (ticker: XLV), a good proxy for larger health-care companies, is $6.31 a share, up 8% from $5.82 in 2019.In its recent assessment of dividend trends, IHS Markit noted that the health-care sector “has shown a very aggressive capital deployment stance in fiscal-year 2019 with mergers and acquisitions being the top priority followed by rising cash dividends.”IHS Markit expects the sector to boost its dividends by 9.3%, helped by sustainable free cash flow and lower debt levels.Goldman Sachs      shares IHS Markit’s optimistic outlook for health-care dividend stocks. For analytical purposes, Goldman divides the broad market into various baskets of stocks, one of which focuses on dividend growth. That particular basket, Goldman Sachs wrote in a note dated Jan. 3, “offers longer-term investors a premium yield while positioning for a value rotation.” Growth stocks have outperformed value names for many years, though value stocks did better in the last four months of 2019. Goldman Sachs observed in the research note that “the outlook for growth and value remains muddy” as stand-alone investments, and that “we recommend strategies that combine growth and value.” Goldman’s dividend-growth basket of stocks was recently yielding 3.6%, compared with 2.1% for the S&P 500, and it traded at a substantial discount to the broader market. These stocks offer 10% dividend growth through next year, compared with 5% for the broader market, Goldman Sachs says. The health-care stocks in the basket are            AbbVie      (ABBV), which recently yielded 5.3%;            Gilead Sciences      (GILD), 3.9%;            Pfizer      (PFE), 3.9%;            Cardinal Health       (CAH), 3.9%;            Amgen      (AMGN), 2.7%;            Bristol-Myers Squibb      (BMY), 2.8%; and            Eli Lilly      (LLY), 2.2%.  Meanwhile, the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to increase their dividends by an average of 9% on a per-share basis, based on consensus estimates. IHS Markit notes that “many of the leading tech payers have relatively large cash balances and low debt profiles, reinforcing the sector’s status as top payer.” That includes            Microsoft      (MSFT), which has regularly increased its dividend at a double-digit pace, and            Apple      (AAPL), whose net cash at the end of September totaled $98 billion. Microsoft was recently yielding 1.3%, and Apple was at 1%—both well below the S&P 500’s average of about 2%.The yields of Microsoft and Apple are also punier than the tech stocks in the Goldman Sachs dividend-growth basket. But in terms of total dividend payouts expected this year, Microsoft and Apple are expected to rank in the top five of U.S. companies, according to IHS Markit.The tech names in Goldman’s dividend-growth basket include            Texas Instruments      (TXN), which recently yielded 2.8%;            IBM       (IBM), 4.8%;            Broadcom      (AVGO), 4.2%;            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), 3%; and            NetApp      (NTAP), 3.1%.Of course, health care and tech aren’t the only sectors that offer dividend growth. Based on consensus estimates, consumer-discretionary and energy companies in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends this year by 8% on average. Consider, though, that the            Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR       exchange-traded fund (XLY), a proxy for companies in that sector, yields about 1.3%—not all that enticing. And energy stocks have lagged behind the broader market, their attractive yields notwithstanding. The            Energy Select Sector SPDR      ETF (XLE) was recently yielding about 3.7%.Utilities in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends on a per share basis by an average of 7%, a respectable gain if it occurs. However, many of these stocks have been bid up, as investors seek yield in a low-rate environment, essentially treating them as a bond proxy. The            Utilities Select Sector SPDR      ETF (XLU), for example, trades at about 19.7 forward earnings estimates, some 15% above its five-year average of 17.2 times, according to FactSet.Income investors could also turn to the financial, materials, and industrial sectors of the S&P 500 for yield growth. Such stocks are expected to boost their dividends by 6% this year on a per share basis, according to consensus estimates. Take financials, for instance. They are expected to yield 2.2% on average, and many individual banks sport even higher yields.            JPMorgan Chase’s      (JPM) was recently at 2.6%, the same as            Citigroup’s      (C).            Wells Fargo      (WFC) was at 3.8%, compared with a 2.1% yield for            Bank of America      (BAC).Although dividend growth should slow this year, there should still be plenty of yield available in various sectors. But it’s important to understand the fundamentals of a company, even if its yield is alluring. • Write to Lawrence C.

1,"NetApp      stock was trading modestly higher Wednesday afternoon after reported on mixed results for its fiscal second quarter.For the quarter ended October 25, the data storage systems and services company posted revenue of $1.37 billion, down from $1.52 billion in the year-earlier quarter, and a hair below consensus at $1.38 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.09 a share beat the Street estimate of 94 cents.In an interview with Barron’s Wednesday afternoon, CEO George Kurian said the enterprise spending environment remains cautious, but is no better or worse than the prior quarter. Kurian also said the company continues to execute on a plan announced last quarter to grow its sales team by 200 people by the end of the fiscal first quarter of next year—and that the added sales capacity should allow the company to report top-line growth on a full-year basis in fiscal year 2021. For the fiscal third quarter, NetApp (ticker: NTAP) expects revenue of $1.39 billion to $1.54 billion, consistent with the Street consensus at $1.47 billion, with adjusted earnings of $1.14 to $1.22 a share, also in line with the Street forecast of $1.18 a share.The company said it returned $611 million to holders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.“We are delivering real business value to customers’ hybrid multi-cloud environments, increasing our strategic relevance, and enabling us to reach new buyers, address new workloads, and expand our presence with existing customers,” Kurian said in a statement.NetApp stock in late trading was up 1.1% to $60.75.

The results came as a nice surprise in an IT spending environment—especially for storage—that lately has been showing signs of being vulnerable to weakening global economic growth. See, for instance, the recent cautionary comments from            NetApp      (ticker: NTAP) and Pure Storage (PSTG).For the quarter, Nutanix (NTNX) posted revenue of $299.9 million, down about 1% from a year earlier. The company blamed the drop on a decline in “pass-through hardware” revenue, where there is little value add from the company, to $13 million from $35.9 million. That drop reflects a recent shift to a subscription-based software model. On a non-GAAP basis, the company lost 57 cents a share, narrower than Wall Street’s consensus forecast for a loss of 64 cents a share.For the current first quarter, Nutanix sees $290 million to $300 million in software and support revenue, up from $286.9 million in the July quarter, with an adjusted EPS loss of 75 cents a share, wider than consensus at 57 cents. The company sees first-quarter software and support billings of $360 million to $370 million, up from $358.7 million in the latest quarter.“We delivered a solid fourth quarter and believe our performance reflects our execution improvements and the meaningful progress we have made transitioning our business to a subscription model,” CEO Dheeraj Pandey said in a statement. “We are encouraged by our record gross margins, strengthening pipeline, progress in sales hiring, and recent large customer wins. We have a strong set of tenured sales leaders in place and continue to lead the industry as an innovator with technology at the forefront of hybrid cloud transformation.”Nutanix shares jumped 18.5% in late trading, to $23.22.Nutanix shares have had a rough year. Even after today’s late-trading spike, they’re down about 65% from their 52-week peak. Two years ago, the company announced plans to shift their business model from a hardware-based approach to a subscription-based software strategy. It’s difficult for software makers to go from perpetual licenses to subscription-based services; going from hardware to software is tougher still. Wednesday’s results suggest the company is making progress. CEO Dheeraj Pandey noted in an interview that 71% of Nutanix’s revenue was from subscriptions in the quarter, a higher level than the company had expected.“Going from hardware to software subscriptions in two years in a rarity,” he said. “It requires gumption and courage. But we thought we had to do it.”Pandey said the company is “waiting and watching” for any impact on its business from a slowing global economy but that Nutanix is not seeing many issues yet, aside from “some local things in Europe” and slowing business from the U.S. government.

1,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (ticker: HPE) shares rose after hours Thursday as the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year outlook.For the fiscal third quarter ended July 31, the enterprise software and hardware company reported revenue of $7.22 billion, down 7% from a year ago, and about in line with Street estimates at $7.26 billion. But non-GAAP earnings of 45 cents a share were ahead of the company’s previous guidance range of 40 to 44 cents a share, and ahead of the Street consensus at 44 cents. The company also said it now expects to close its acquisition of the supercomputing pioneer Cray by the end of the October 2019 fiscal year, earlier than originally planned.“In Q3, we improved both gross and operating margins, delivered strong non-GAAP earnings, and generated a record level of year-to-date free cash flow,” CEO Antonio Neri said in a statement. “Our strong operational performance reflects continued disciplined execution as we deliberately shift and enhance our portfolio to provide customers with higher-value, software-defined offerings, delivered as a service.”For the full year, the company now sees non-GAAP earnings of $1.72 to $1.76 a share, up from previous guidance of $1.62 to $1.72. For the fourth quarter, the company is projecting non-GAAP profits of 43 to 47 cents a share. The Wall Street consensus is 44 cents.Coming amid a series of cautious comments on the outlook for IT spending from companies like            Cisco      (CSCO),            Intel      (INTC) and            NetApp (NTAP),      the solid guidance from Hewlett Packard Enterprise is being well received by investors.In late trading, Hewlett Packard stock was up 82 cents, or 6.3% to $13.75.HP Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri said in an interview Tuesday night that the company “executed with discipline to expand profitability, with a record level of free cash flow,” despite the 7% drop at the top line. Neri said HPE has been intentionally backing away from some less appealing businesses, giving up on some vertical markets and geographies in its IT services segment, for instance.Neri notes that the company has been using the strong cash flow to fulfill the promise he made in the first quarter of 2018 to return $7 billion in capital to holders—he says the company returned $4.5 billion in fiscal 2018 in the form of dividends and stock repurchases and expects to complete the $7 billion program this year.Neri said macro uncertainty is creating some elongated sales cycles for large deals and an “uneven market,” but that the fiscal fourth-quarter revenue trajectory is “no different than seasonal trends.” Neri said HPE “absolutely will return to growth at the topline,” with a deliberate mix shift in the works, with a focus on areas like high performance computing, hybrid cloud, and the company’s Nimble storage business—although he wouldn’t say when they might start growing again.

0,"Shares of            Pure Storage      (ticker: PSTG) edged higher in late trading Wednesday after the enterprise storage company reported better-than-expected earnings results for its fiscal second quarter. Its revenue guidance disappointed, however, and it announced the departure of CFO Tim Riitters. For the second quarter ended July 31, the producer of flash memory-based storage arrays posted revenue of $393.3 million, up 28% year-over-year, slightly ahead of the Street consensus and within the company’s previous guidance range of $389 million to $401 million. Pure posted non-GAAP earnings of a penny share, beating the consensus forecast of a loss of 4 cents. Pure Storage CEO Charles Giancarlo said in an interview that the second quarter was marked by a dramatic drop in the price of NAND flash memory, the dominant component in the company’s storage arrays. While he says pricing has stabilized, Giancarlo notes that results will be affected the rest of the year by the reduced NAND pricing as it flows through to Pure’s customers. In short, Pure’s customers can now buy the same amount of storage at lower prices.For the third quarter, Pure Storage is projecting revenue of $434 million to $446 million, falling short of the previous Street view of $466.3 million. And for the January 2020 fiscal year, Pure cut its revenue outlook to between $1.645 billion and $1.715 billion, from a previous range of $1.7 billion to $1.77 billion.The company didn’t see any impact on demand in the latest quarter from macroeconomic concerns, Giancarlo says. But to be conservative, the company’s guidance does reflect a potential slowdown, he notes. “What tends to limit our growth is more how many sellers we have in the field and how many accounts they can call on, less macro factors and more on the competitive environment and execution,” he says.As for China, Giancarlo notes that it is a nonissue for Pure, which doesn’t sell into the Chinese market and buys few components sourced from China.The Pure CEO notes that despite the reduced revenue forecast, the company is still projecting 23.5% growth at the midpoint of the guidance range. Thats quite a contrast to the forecast by rival NetApp (NTAP) for a 5% to 10% decline in revenue in fiscal 2020.Pure also said its board has authorized a $150 million stock buyback program.In late trading, Pure Storage stock was recently up 1.4% to $14.07.

1,"This week, investors will get a fresh look at the state of enterprise-technology spending, as            HP,VMware,Salesforce.com,      and            Pure Storage      all report July-quarter earnings, and            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      and            Dell Technologies      are not far behind. There is growing concern that the numbers will not tell a happy story.On Tuesday, Citi analyst Jim Suva cut his estimates on HP (ticker: (HPQ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and Dell (DELL), citing “a more difficult macro backdrop” for enterprise hardware spending. He thinks a widely anticipated second-half recovery in IT spending will be “more muted than initially expected.”For the personal-computer companies—in particular HP and Dell—he actually sees some near-term upside as “demand pull” ahead of new China tariffs provides strong July-quarter PC sales for both companies. That will be aided by easing of recent tight supplies of            Intel      (INTC) microprocessors and the continued migration of corporate users to the Windows 10 operating system software, as            Microsoft      (MSFT) prepares to drop support for Windows 7 early in 2020. But Suva argues that PC demand will wane in coming quarters, as the refresh ahead of the Windows 7 support expiration fades and macro conditions remain difficult.For HP in particular, Suva cut his rating to Buy from Neutral, asserting that positive near-term data points in PCs will be offset by mixed data in printers, with “limited positive catalysts ahead.” Suva notes that Canon, an important partner for HP in the printer business, made cautious comments recently on the laser-printer segment. Suva also thinks economic weakness could pressure commercial purchases in PCs and printers as we move into calendar 2020. The analyst notes that HP is trading at just 8.5 times the next 12 months’ earnings, well below its five-year median range at 10.8 times, and that a shift to more contractual services and 3-D printing are strong opportunities. But he adds that “upside to estimates and multiples remain more limited and hence we move to the sidelines.”Meanwhile, Suva writes that he is “opening a short-term negative catalyst watch” for HP Enterprise, but not downgrading, given its reasonable valuation. He now expects more-muted second-half spending than the Street currently anticipates, citing recently mixed comments on enterprise spending from companies like Intel,            Western Digital      (WDC),            Cisco Systems      (CSCO),            Arista Networks      (ANET), and NetApp (NTAP). “Our short term negative catalyst watch is based on our view of these concerns and consensus expectations too high,” he writes. “Mid to long term we see continued shift to cloud pressuring revenues for tech hardware spending.”Suva kept a Buy rating on Dell, which he contends is “better positioned than its peers...to continue to outgrow the overall market.” Suva also notes that he expected Dell to pay down debt, setting the stage for multiple expansion as the company de-levers. Suva set new price targets on all three stocks. For HP, he goes to $21, from $25; for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, $14, from $17; and for Dell, $65, from $85.On Tuesday HP is down 19 cents, or 1%, to $19.02. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is off 16 cents, or 1.2%, to $12.95. Dell is down 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $48.93. Write to Eric J.

1,"Tech stock earnings season continues this week, as            Cisco Systems      (ticker: CSCO) reports earnings Wednesday for its July quarter. And there are reasons for optimism about the networking equipment giant’s shares.J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee pointed out in a research note Monday that the stock is trading about 10% below its 52-week high, pressured by investor concerns about the U.S.-China trade spat, and a nasty earnings disappointment from            NetApp (NTAP)      that hinted at softening Enterprise IT spending. But Chatterjee repeated his Overweight rating and $62 price target on the stock, and offered three reasons he thinks the bearish tone on the stock is overdone:For those reasons, Cisco can show top-line acceleration, with mid-single-digit revenue growth going forward, Chatterjee writes. “We believe the recent weakness in CSCO shares offer an attractive entry point,” he writes. The stock trades at 15.4 times earnings on a next 12 months basis, below the market multiple at 16.7 times, despite a “superior medium-term top-line and earnings growth outlook.”For Cisco’s fiscal fourth quarter ended July 31, Street consensus calls for revenue of $13.39 billion, up 6%, with earnings of 82 cents a share. Cisco’s guidance for the quarter called for revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, with non-GAAP profits of 80 to 82 cents a share.On Monday morning, Cisco stock fell 21 cents, or 0.4%, to $52.22.

0,"International Business Machines      stock was rising on Thursday, helped in part by a bullish note from Morgan Stanley, which argues that the Street is underestimating the benefits of the company’s Red Hat acquisition.  The back story. IBM shares (ticker: IBM) have climbed 32.5% year to date, outpacing the        S&P 500’s      19% gain and just edging ahead of the        Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s      (XLK) 32% rise. The company completed the Red Hat deal, the largest acquisition in its history, in July and reported better-than-expected earnings last month.  What’s new. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty resumed coverage of IBM shares with an Overweight rating and $170 price target. She wrote that normalized growth accelerated in the most recent quarter, and with Red Hat now part of IBM, that should drive sustainable annual growth of 2%—a rate that the stock’s current valuation doesn’t seem to reflect.  Looking ahead. “IBM is in the later innings of a transformation meant to return the company to growth and margin expansion, both of which kicked in over the past year and should accelerate post the closing of the Red Hat acquisition,” Huberty said. Because the Red Hat deal has stolen the spotlight, she thinks investors are overlooking “meaningful acceleration” in IBM’s core sales—all the more impressive given that the growth at peers has decelerated. Her base case calls for about 15% upside to Wednesday’s closing price, not including any revenue synergies from Red Hat. Such synergies could lead to even more upside, and in a bull case scenario she thinks the shares could reach $197. Moreover, IBM is already trading at a discount to            Cisco System       (CSCO),            NetApp       (NTAP) and            Oracle       (ORCL), peers that are also in the midst of transforming into a more cloud-based, software-heavy model.

0," This article first appeared on SumZero, the world’s largest research community of buyside investment professionals. In some cases, Barron’s edits the research for brevity; professional investors can access the full version of this thesis and tens of thousands of others at SumZero.com.  Disclaimer: The author of this idea had a position in this security at the time of posting and may trade in and out of this position without informing the SumZero community.  Target price: $50.00   Initial price (02/25/20): $27.37   Recent price: $22.06   Timeframe: 1-2 Years As more enterprises migrate their operations onto the cloud and the complexity of business software systems increases, having a robust and adaptive vulnerability management (VM) procedure becomes increasingly vital to successful operational risk management. The total addressable market for security and VM is expected to hit $14 billion by 2026 with highly predictable revenue due to the subscription business model. As both large and small companies continue to bolster their cybersecurity, the VM industry provides a secular growth tailwind to Tenable and its peers.  Investment Thesis Co-founded in 2002 by current CTO Renaud Deraison, Tenable quickly became an industry favorite with its flagship VM product Nessus. Tenable is the fastest growing company in the VM space, with non-GAAP revenue projected to grow more than 20% for the next two years, reaching more than $600 million by 2022. The Nessus platform has had very positive reviews from its customer base, and this positive brand momentum should continue to help Tenable capture the largest market share of this growing industry. Tenable management has continued to invest more heavily than its peers in selling, general, and administrative expenses; research and development; and mergers and acquisitions. These additional costs have caused the company to lag its peers in achieving profitability, and that has hurt the stock. Tenable shares now trade significantly lower than the $33.00 level at which they made their public market debut in July 2018. But given the company’s early investments aimed at capturing market share and its recent accelerated timeline for becoming free cash flow positive, the current valuation provides an entry point with attractive risk/reward.  What Do Customers Think? The VM industry is currently dominated by three major players: Tenable,            Rapid7,      and Qualys. On the surface, products from all three companies seem to perform the same tasks. Customers looking to purchase a VM platform likely will rely on peer reviews as a starting point in their due-diligence process. An analysis of data from third-party review websites and reports shows that Tenable is the clear leader in all areas of competition, from the installation process to scope of functionality. According to trusted reviews on Gartner.com, Tenable boasts the highest recommendation rating (92%) in its space and has received the most reviews by a significant margin. User reviews focus on positives such as easy installation, excellent support, and great user experience. As the VM industry continues to grow, it’s vital for companies to maintain their online advertising and branding momentum. A Google search of “Vulnerability Management” returns Rapid7 as the leading firm in terms of SEO, while Tenable comes in at a decent No. 5. However, that result is offset by the leading interest levels for Tenable shown on Google Trends. Given the positive customer reviews and upward trending interest over the past five years, Tenable is positioned well to capture a large market share within this still-growing industry.  Can Management Execute? Amit Yoran, CEO of Tenable, has about two decades of cybersecurity experience and an impressive track record. He founded NetWitness, which was acquired by RSA, and was CEO of Riptech, which was acquired by            Symantec.      He also did a stint as national cybersecurity director for the Department of Homeland Security. He is a clear innovator who can execute on his vision and will be a long-term driver in Tenable’s growth. Renaud Deraison, CTO and co-founder of Tenable, also has a long track record of success in the industry. He invented Tenable’s Nessus software and has continued to oversee its implementation and further development. He has won several industry awards and is a respected figure within the industry. Tenable’s management team seem to possess the experience necessary to continue pushing the company toward further innovation and expansion of product offerings through organic channels and acquisitions.  Potential Buyout Given the long-term growth potential of both the VM space and Tenable, it wouldn’t be surprising if a buyout offer comes from a bigger player looking to get into the space. Tenable is laser focused on gaining market share in the higher-end enterprise market, which would represent an excellent recurring revenue stream if executed effectively. In the most recent quarter, it added more than 400 high-end enterprise customers. Once it achieves a sizable customer base, it will become an attractive target.  Company Financials Tenable has done well at growing revenue over the last couple of years. Year-over-year revenue growth was 50% in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 30% in 2019. The company forecasts 20%-30% growth in 2020. The company is also working to improve its operating margin and bottom line. Tenable has offered guidance for a 2020 non-GAAP operating loss of $33 million to $38 million. That would be an improvement from the non-GAAP operating loss of $43 million in 2019. Its net loss for 2020 is projected to be between $36 million and $41 million, similar to the $40 million loss in 2019. With more than $200 million in cash, Tenable is in a favorable leverage position, and net debt is $166 million. Management also expects the company to achieve positive free cash flow for all of 2020, which is an accelerated timeline. Overall, Tenable has a solid balance sheet as well as good top-line growth and improving margins and net Income. This positions the company well to continue capturing market share and expand its offerings  Summary  Overall, Tenable’s current discount to peers provides an interesting opportunity for a catch-up trade, especially considering the strong fundamental backdrop for the company to become the leader in the VM space.  For the full report, including charts and a valuation discussion, please go to SumZero.com.   This article has been corrected to note that Renaud Deraison is the CTO of Tenable, that its non-GAAP revenue is projected to reach more than $600 million by 2022, and that its 2019 non-GAAP operating loss was $43 million.

1,"Just weeks after agreeing to acquire Credit Karma for $7 billion,            Intuit      is considering buying another fintech firm, two people familiar with the matter said. Intuit (ticker: INTU) is “looking hard” at Finicity, which is up for sale, these people said. Other possible targets include Credit Sesame and NerdWallet. Finicity is expected to sell for $1 billion to $2 billion, while Credit Sesame could go for $500 million to $750 million. It’s unclear what NerdWallet might fetch. Intuit, the tax-software company known for QuickBooks and TurboTax, confirmed Feb. 24 that it was acquiring Credit Karma for $7.1 billion. The merger combines two companies that aim to solve the personal finance problems of consumers, a statement said. “We do not comment on speculations or rumors,” an Intuit spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions. Coronavirus-related volatility continued to weigh on the broad market Monday; Intuit’s shares dropped 4.3%, or $11.45, to $263.73 in morning trading. Market volatility has slowed down many transactions, with some expecting a drop in M&A valuations. This could mean a buying opportunity. “There is a lot of money on the sidelines and I would expect companies to take advantage,” a banker said. Finicity is a data aggregator; its Application Programming Interface, better known as API, is a software intermediary that lets two applications talk to each other. The Murray, Utah-based firm provides a suite of APIs that helps companies like            Experian      or Ellie Mae to authenticate and enroll customers. Finicity has raised some $80 million in funding, Crunchbase said. Investors include Experian Ventures, PitchBook said. The company is similar to Plaid, which            Visa      agreed to buy in January for $5.3 billion. Plaid’s APIs help users connect their bank accounts to finance apps and transfer money. The deal has led many to wonder which fintech would get sold next. Credit Sesame, which had been expected to go public later this year or in 2021, is a smaller version of Credit Karma. Launched in 2010, the Mountain View, Calif., company has been profitable since 2017, the company said. Like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame offers consumers unlimited free access to credit scores, as well as identity theft protection and savings recommendations. Credit Sesame has raised $120.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. That includes a $43 million round in August. Investors include Menlo Ventures, Inventus Capital, Globespan Capital, IA Capital Groups,            Symantec,      Capital One Ventures, and Stanford University.Some, however, doubted Credit Karma’s interest. “Credit Sesame is just like Credit Karma,” one private equity executive said. “Why would they want two?”Founded in 2009, NerdWallet aims to help users make better personal financial decisions. This includes picking a credit card, a personal loan or a mortgage. The San Francisco company has raised $105 million in funding through four rounds, Crunchbase said. Investors include IVP, Core Innovation Capital and Camelot Financial Capital Management. “It’s our company policy not to comment on speculation or rumors related to our business, our solutions or our markets,” Andy Capener, a Finicity spokesman, said in an emailed response to questions. Credit Sesame and NerdWallet could not be reached for comment.

0,"How a company’s stock reacts to its earnings report first and foremost depends on the quality of the results. But how the numbers come in relative to analysts’ expectations can be even more indicative of the way the stock reacts. And when investors have a strong view on a company’s upcoming trajectory going into an earnings report, any deviation can mean a sharp move in a stock’s price—sometimes seemingly counter to the actual reported results.For example, last Wednesday,            Facebook      (ticker: FB) posted 25% revenue growth and 8% profit growth for its latest quarter—both healthy increases for a company of its size and ahead of Wall Street consensus going into the report. But the social media giant had a high bar to hurdle. Facebook stock had well outperformed the market since it last reported earnings on Oct. 30, rising 19% versus a 7% gain for the        S&P 500      index. Just in the month before reporting, the stock and index rose 7% and 1%, respectively. Facebook also outpaced other technology stocks.That short-term optimism was clearly overblown. Facebook stock dropped over 6% on Thursday.There are 90 S&P 500 components releasing results this week. These are the ones that have climbed the most in the past month through Friday’s close, while the S&P 500 has returned less than 2%:Source: FactSetA couple of the biggest winners going into their earnings reports this week are defense stocks, like            L3Harris Technologies      (ticker: LHX), or suppliers of components to defense companies, like            TransDigm Group      (TDG). They both got a big bump in early January as Middle East tensions spiked, and escalating conflict between the U.S. and Iran looked likely. Management might be asked this week if they see a positive impact on their business going forward.Other stocks jumped due to specific one-time factors.            NortonLifeLock      (NLOK) saw its shares rise recently after it declared a special dividend.            Paycom Software      (PAYC) was added to the S&P 500 index in its latest reshuffling and saw buying from index funds.The stocks that have outperformed sharply over the past month without a clear catalyst—            Motorola Solutions      (MSI) or            FleetCor Technologies      (FLT)—are the ones to watch the most closely when they report this week. Investors are expressing their optimism by buying shares, and could still be disappointed by what is otherwise a strong report.Conversely, stocks that go into their earnings sitting on heavy recent losses might only need a slightly better-than-expected or in-line report to see a positive reaction.Here are this week’s reporters that have dropped the most over the past month:Source: FactSetHow a stock has performed before its earnings report of course can’t alone determine how the market will react to new information.

1,"No news wasn’t good news on Monday. Stocks finished at or near their lows for the day as investors awaited more news on the U.S.-China trade negotiations. Some of the doubts carried over into Tuesday, sending overseas stocks and dragging down futures on the main U.S. stock indexes. Hong Kong’s        Hang Seng Index,      for instance, was down 0.2%. Europe’s        FTSE 100 Index      fell 1.2%, while futures on the        Dow Jones Industrial Average,        S&P 500       and        Nasdaq Composite      were all off by about 0.4%. Several stocks were on the move following the release of quarterly earnings as the recent flurry of profit reports winds down.The online pet-supply retailer            Chewy      (ticker: CHWY) and the online wardrobe company            Stitch Fix      (SFIX) both reported higher sales than Wall Street expected, The stocks, however, are moving in opposite directions. Chewy shares are down about 4% in premarket trading. Traders may be worried about the looming expiration of a ban, or lockup, on sales of stock by insiders, founders and venture capital backers. Stitch shares, on the other hand, are soaring, up 11.1%, in premarket trading after management reported strong quarterly results. R&D facilitator            Agilent Technologies      (A) shares were up about 3.2% after news reports indicated activist fund Pershing Square took a stake in the company. NortonLifeLock      (NLOK) shares are up as well, by about 3.4%. The Wall Street Journal reported the software provider might combine with antivirus firm McAfee. Sanofi      (SNY) share gained about 4.1%. Management laid out the pharmaceutical company’s growth plans in a press release ahead of an investor event scheduled for Tuesday. In the release, Sanofi said it would stop development on some diabetes and cardiovascular drugs. Finally, former            General Electric      (GE) insurance subsidiary            Genworth Financial      (GNW) shares were up 8.9%.

1,"Zscaler      stock is sharply higher Monday after the Web security software received an analyst upgrade. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Bartus raised his rating on the company to Buy from Neutral, with a new price target of $68, up from $65. Bartus writes in a research note that the sharp pullback in the shares since the summer has provided an attractive opportunity to buy the stock. Zscaler stock spiked to close to $90 in July amid an investor-buying frenzy in cloud-based software companies, than sharply reversed course as concerns grew about valuation, recently falling below the $50 level. Bartus contends the company is “poised for sustainable high growth and outperformance,” driven by trends like software-defined networking, adoption of cloud applications, and consolidation of security functions into fewer applications.“Zscaler is the leading cloud-based security platform that helps customers consolidate and outsource the management of cumbersome security appliances—a major trend we expect to persist for the next few years,” he writes. Bartus thinks the company has a path to $2 billion in revenue by 2025, asserting that the company can pass            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) and Symantec’s legacy business that was sold toBroadcom      (AVGO) in the market for secure web gateways.“We believe Zscaler’s approach is future-proof and at a valuable intersection of many industry tailwinds,” he writes.Zscaler stock is up 8.4% to $50.23 in Monday trading.

On Tuesday, he raised his rating for the chip maker to Overweight from Equal-weight and increased his stock price target to $367 from $298.It has been an eventful year for Broadcom. Last month the chip maker received an order from the European Union to stop some allegedly anticompetitive practices in its contracts. In August, Broadcom announced it will buy the enterprise security business of            Symantec.Broadcom “is priced for risks associated with the Symantec deal; we see possible value creation as it extends into software and builds on a current strong position in semis,” he wrote. “We highlight a risk/reward significantly more compelling than our broader semis coverage.”Broadcom shares were up 3.2% to $321.10 on Tuesday.Hettenbach said the company will be able to generate strong cash flows from its chip business, which will enable further investments in the software industry. The analyst said Broadcom is his new top idea in his coverage.Other Wall Street analysts are generally positive on Broadcom.

1,"After            Broadcom’s      attempt to buy security software company Symantec reportedly collapsed last month, the two companies may reach a deal after all—albeit not a full acquisition.  The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the two companies are close to an arrangement that would allow the chip maker Broadcom to buy          Symantec’s      enterprise business, potentially valuing the unit around $10 billion.Neither company immediately responded to a request for comment.Symantec stock soared up 11% to $22.73 a share on Thursday. Broadcom stock was down for much of the morning, but edged up 0.3% to $270.89 around noon on Thursday. Symantec is set to report fiscal first-quarter earnings after the market closes.Symantec stock tanked last month on reports that its possible acquisition by Broadcom fell through. Broadcom has been looking to expand into enterprise software. Last year, it bought the enterprise software company CA Technologies for close to $19 billion.And though the reported deal wouldn’t be a purchase of all of Symantec this time around, PiperJaffray’s Harsh Kumar noted Broadcom might be better off for it.“We feel Broadcom management feels now is the time to add leverage to its existing software base,” he wrote. “In our view, the ‘core’ infrastructure software business now exists, and management can push/ leverage the ‘all you can eat’ subscription-based model by adding more products to its current software offering.” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey’s William Stein touted Broadcom’s acquisition history, comparing the stock’s early dip this morning to when its deal for CA Technologies was announced last year. The stock recovered, and CA became one of its better-performing parts in 2019, he noted.“Management and others may highlight a sophisticated strategic fit (focusing on revenue synergies),” he wrote. “Further, we think that if AVGO’s interest is solely in the Enterprise segment, it does seem realistic to us that AVGO could cross-sell CA’s mainframe systems management software with SYMC’s cybersecurity software.” Write to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.comAfter Broadcom’s attempt to buy security software company Symantec reportedly collapsed last month, the two companies may reach a deal after all—albeit not a full acquisition.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Revenue and profit estimates for the semiconductor industry continue to ratchet lower, amid a range of both supply-chain and demand issues. And the same process is under way for the chip equipment makers that serve them. But for both sectors, there are values to find if you know where to look.This morning, UBS chip analyst Timothy Arcuri reset estimates for his entire coverage universe, which includes all of the major chip and equipment companies. For most of the companies he covers, he reduced revenue forecasts for both 2020 and 2021, and he brought price targets down for most of the stocks he covers as well. He also shifted some ratings around. In a few cases, he’s feeling more bullish.Arcuri notes that revenue for the semiconductor industry fell 35% in two quarters during the 2008-09 downturn, and took three quarters to fully recover. But he adds that comparisons are easier this time, coming off a weak 2019, especially for memory chips. He writes that his new base case is for a 20% drop in semiconductor revenues through the September quarter with a gradual recovery to parity by June 2021. Calendar 2020 revenues, he says, will be off 15%-20% from pre-virus estimates. He adds that “computer” related stocks—            Intel       (ticker: INTC) and            Nvidia       (NVDA), for instance—should be more defensive, and that supply constraints should help on memory. (He likes            Micron.      ) But he sees risks for smartphone-related stocks, and weakness in the automotive chip sector.For the equipment sector, he says, revenue will follow semis lower, but he’s more bullish on the group than he is on chips. He says that “supply constraints should keep order books full making the snap-back faster than for semis,” and he adds that there are “few if any weak balance sheets among top chip spenders.” Arcuri also notes that Chinese customers “remain full speed ahead and may even accelerate timeliness.”Arcuri on Friday lifted his ratings on            Lam Research      (LRCX) to Buy from Sell and on            KLA       (KLAC) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) to Neutral from Sell. He also upgrades            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Neutral from Sell.His bullish stance on Lam reflects the company’s out-sized exposure to the memory sector. He writes that Applied has growing exposure to memory, though he is concerned about the company’s display business, and he sees risk in its large exposure to the contract chip manufacturer            Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM). He says KLA should get a boost from supply constraint issues in the equipment sector, though he thinks the story in the foundry and logic end markets—where KLA has significant exposure—isn’t as compelling as it is for memory.On Texas Instruments, Arcuri says that he still has concerns about their big exposure to the automotive and industrial vertical markets, but that the issue is already reflected in the stock price. “Virtually all of the company’s revenue growth over the past 4 years has come from this vertical so this remains a concern as we look forward but the sell side has also been aggressively cutting global production estimates over the past few weeks and highly visible production shut-downs in Europe make it hard to argue that investors have not contemplated this as a risk,” he writes.In Friday trading, amid a sharp market slide, chip and equipment stocks are trading lower across the board, with Lam, Arcuri’s favorite, down 6.4%, to $243.42.

0,"Semiconductor shares were leading the market higher on a strong rebound day for the broader market Tuesday, as analysts and investors sort through the rubble of the downturn looking for likely winners coming out it. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised his rating Tuesday morning on            Nvidia       shares (ticker: NVDA) to Buy from Hold, setting a price target of $270. “We acknowledge it’s risky to upgrade a stock given this vicious pandemic and the subsequent economic fallout,” he writes in a research note. “However, during this uncertain time, we believe investors will flock to companies with superior balance sheets and robust free cash flow. Nvidia fits the bill.”Gill expects a pickup in demand for Nvidia graphics processors used for medical research applications in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. “GPUs can accelerate the analysis of whole genomes, which consist of 3 billion base pairs in human chromosomes, from days to less than one hour,” he writes. Gill also notes that with the stock down 35% from its peak as of Monday’s close, the stock trades at a multiyear P/E low.Goldman Sachs chip analyst Toshiya Hari chopped estimates across the board on Tuesday for both chip companies and semiconductor-equipment stocks—but he has a few stocks to recommend. Hari’s estimate cuts are driven by recent downward revisions in the outlook for key markets served by the chip industry. Goldman Sachs sees smartphone shipments this year down 1.4% from 2019, personal computer shipments off 10% and automotive sales down 3.5%. Hari writes that he has taken an approach of cutting estimates based on how various groups have fared in past recessions. “While we take no view on the development of Covid-19 and the impact it could have on end demand, and in turn, the semiconductor industry, we believe it is prudent to assume a peak-to-trough correction that is consistent with past downturns.”In reviewing the group, Hari shuffled some ratings, lifting his stance on            Xilinx       (XLNX) to Buy from Neutral and            Intel      (INTC) to Neutral from Sell. But he cut            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Sell from Neutral, and            Cabot Microelectronics      (CCMP) to Neutral from Buy. He also removed            Applied Materials      (AMAT) from Goldman’s conviction list, while keeping his Buy rating on the equipment company.Xilinx makes field-programmable gate arrays, parts used in communications, data center, aerospace and other applications. While Hari says Xilinx isn’t immune to a downturn, he contends that the underperformance of Xilinx shares over the past 3, 6 and 12 months reduces the stock’s risk. He thinks fundamentals in the communications sector are “at or near trough,” and writes that data center remains “a secular growth business.” Hari contends that other key sectors for Xilinx—aerospace and defense—in addition to test and instruments are less economically sensitive than other chip end markets. The analyst also notes that Xilinx, as a chip maker that doesn’t operate its own factories, “has historically demonstrated relative gross margin stability during economic downturns” and that “relative valuation multiples are near-trough” levels. Hari concludes that any signs of improving earnings should drive an outsize gain in Xilinx shares. For Texas Instruments, Hari cut his price target to $88 from $123. He notes that the stock is often perceived as a haven, but that weakness in many of its key end markets as well as “above-peer operating leverage,” given it operates its own factories, “should pressure margins over the next few quarters and drive negative earnings-per-share revisions in excess of those for its peers.”As for Intel, Hari writes that there are “multiple near-term positive developments that could largely offset the headwinds,” including resilience in the server market and potentially in personal computers as more people work and study from home. But he says that because of increased competition, growing capital intensity and pressure on margins, he would avoid overweighting the stock.The downgrade of Cabot Micro, Hari says, reflects a special situation. The company’s core electronics materials business, which makes slurries used in chip-making, “is a high-growth, high margin business with a deep/wide competitive moat, and one that we continue to view positively long term.” But the company also makes drag reducing agents, or DRAs, used by oil pipelines. And he sees Cabot feeling the impact on that business as oil pipeline operators in the Permian Basin reduce their use of DRAs. Hari notes that Cabot is down 78% from its highs in February, but that “uncertainty surrounding the DRA business” will likely “weigh on multiples for the foreseeable future.”Near midday Tuesday, Nvidia was up 18%, Intel up 7.5% and Xilinx gained 6.2%. Texas Instruments rallied 5.4%, Cabot climbed 4% and Applied Materials jumped 12.6%. The        PHLX Semiconductor Stock Index      (SOX) rallied 10% and the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      had climbed 8.6%. Write to Eric J.

1,"Investors have been grasping for some sort of framework by which to compare the market rout stoked by the coronavirus outbreak. On Monday, the 11th anniversary of the bull market, they got it: 2008. While it may not be a perfect comparison, strategists are now pointing to the deep downturn during 2008 for clues as to where the markets today will go—and warning value stocks may not be the place for a tactical shift. Instead, many prefer companies with strong balance sheets. Markets globally tumbled Monday, with coronavirus concerns exacerbated by Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war. The S&P 500 opened down 7%, briefly halting trade.As confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China tripled in the past week and the U.S. began grappling with how to deal with the outbreak, strategists started preparing for their worst-case scenarios to become the baseline, even as a lot remained unknown.For the most part, strategists aren’t looking to jump in yet for bargains. “We’re looking for 2008 levels of market fear to tell us the bottoming process has begun and we expect that window will be shorter than the financial crisis,” writes Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. In a note to clients, Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote that 2008 was a financial shock that hit demand whereas the coronavirus shock is one that is hitting both demand and supply and that means it is likely to play out differently. As a result, he expects a sharp economic hit that will play out more like a recession than a depression.• While the 2008 crisis created a deep recession and a slow recovery as both households and financial firms had to heal their balance sheets, the virus is likely to spark sharp drops in output in the affected economies over the next quarter but, as long as virus fades, activity should bounce back as supply constraints are eased. In other words, Shearing writes, expect a short, sharp shock.• Typically, fiscal and monetary stimulus work by boosting demand. But today, the problem lies with both supply and demand. Loans and subsidies to the hardest-hit companies—targeted, temporary and large fiscal support—could offset the shock and central bankers could ease credit troubles with cheap financing to banks to the worst-hit companies. But the speed of the recovery is predicated largely on how the virus spreads and life returns to normal, he notes.• Asset-price collapses have historically triggered severe depressions in the past. In 2008, high levels of leverage in the banking system and other vulnerabilities in the global financial system, such as a dependence on wholesale finance and short-term credit lines, magnified the situation, Shearing notes. The good news: Though debt levels are high, they are concentrated in the government rather than households and thus less risky and banks are better-capitalized. The pockets of vulnerabilities are not big enough to trigger a global crisis, Shearing says. • The biggest risk beyond the immediate coronavirus is likely what the Japanification of more of the developed economies means, where more countries get stuck in a rut of anemic growth and perpetually low interest rates. Interest-rate cuts made to combat this crisis could push more investors to reach for yield, eventually causing bubbles to inflate, thus sowing the seeds of the next major crisis, he warns.Shearing’s outlook is the kind that has investors rushing to find some safety. But most low-volatility stocks are trading at premiums that are making them unattractive to some. And while value stocks sometimes do well out of market routs, strategists aren’t so sure this time. Better positioned may be strong balance-sheet companies. In a note to clients, Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, co-head of portfolio strategy at Bernstein Research, gives two reasons it is hard to make a case for a tactical shift to value: The biggest value sectors are banks and energy—both of which face severe challenges as interest rates tumble, credit risks rise and oil prices plummet. Fraser-Jenkins says large-cap energy stocks could become a core part of an income strategy—but in the medium term rather than the short term. While many investors flock to low-volatility stock because they tend to do well as earnings growth turns negative, Fraser-Jenkins cautions that these stocks tend to reverse quickly as earnings growth bottoms. Plus, in the U.S., low-volatility stocks are expensive and highly linked to short-term bond-yield moves. With the quality of corporate credit at its lowest point in two decades and balance-sheet quality not priced into the stock market the way other quality measures are, Fraser-Jenkins favors stocks of companies with good balance-sheet quality. Plus, companies with strong balance sheets in the U.S. and Europe aren’t expensive, with relative valuations around the middle of their post-1997 historic range—a “relatively inexpensive entry point” for investors seeking protection from the market rout.Electronic Arts      (ticker: EA),            Alphabet      (GOOG),            Procter & Gamble      (PG),            Walmart      (WMT),            Biogen      (BIIB),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Visa      (V), and            Accenture      (ACN) are among the U.S. companies Bernstein listed as having a sector neutral low leverage and high credit ratings, as well as an Outperform rating.The lesson: Not everything that was “safe” last time will be this time around.

1,"There is likely more pain ahead for the semiconductor sector, but Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon says investors should get ready to buy some names on the dip.Chip stocks have tumbled this past week, along with equity markets, as the coronavirus spreads outside of China. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, has declined by about 10% this week, compared with the 9% drop for the S&P 500. “Worries over COVID-19 have recently pressured semis … as of now most semi companies have not baked in much, if any, virus downside,” Rasgon wrote in a note Thursday. “Given this, investors should likely be girding for semiconductor revisions in the near future as they may need to join the supply chain in lowering numbers.”The analyst noted China represents about 35% of sales for the chip industry, adding the smartphone, PC and auto markets are exposed to virus risk both on the supply and demand sides. But Rasgon thinks the business weakness for semiconductors won’t last.“Presumably the situation (however long it lasts) will prove ultimately temporary,” he wrote. “Overall demand levels won’t (in the long term) be permanently impaired. Hence we could see downside (eventually) provide selective buying opportunities.”Rasgon said he has Outperform ratings on            Broadcom      (AVGO),            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI), and            Nvidia      (NVDA).

0,"11:20 a.m.: U.S. stock indexes are solidly in the green as bargain hunters swoop in after two days of steep losses. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      has gained 1.5%, or 412 points, while the        S&P 500       added a similar amount. The        Nasdaq Composite      jumped 1.8%.The Wednesday gains come after all three indexes posted their largest two-day point losses ever to start the week. The selloff was spurred by fears over the sudden uptick in cases of the new form of coronavirus revealed over the weekend. Referred to as Covid-19, it appears to be spreading faster and in more countries beyond China, where it emerged last month. On Tuesday, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that they expect the virus to infect more people in the U.S.The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq each fell more than 6% through Monday and Tuesday, wiping out their 2020 gains and more. The number of new cases in China fell on Wednesday, but more continued to be reported elsewhere, including in Italy, South Korea, and Iran. Still, at least some investors were ready to go shopping for stocks available at a sharp discount to prices seen last week.In a mirror image to the prior two days, the buying was broad on Wednesday. All 11 S&P 500 sectors were in the green and 28 of the Dow’s 30 stocks were up.Technology stocks led the market higher, particularly semiconductor companies such as            Nvidia      (ticker: NVDA), which was up 4.7%. The group as a whole was up 2.4%. Gold was down 0.7%, after a strong start to the week, and U.S. Treasury prices fell slightly after yields on some notes hit record lows on Tuesday. Even oil got a bit of a bounce, up 0.3%. We’re still far from erasing the start of the week’s turbulence, but it shows some investors are ready to take on a bit more risk again.Beyond the human cost of the virus’s spread, investors and analysts worry about the economic impact of authorities’ measures to control the disease. Supply-chain disruptions due to closed factories and falling demand for travel and other forms of consumption threaten to tip a fragile global economy into recession if they last for several months. Major companies including            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Mastercard      (MA), and            United Airlines Holdings      (UAL) have each warned that they’ll be unable to meet prior financial guidance due to Covid-19.There is plenty to keep markets volatile in coming days as investors watch daily updates on virus cases in China, Italy, South Korea, Iran, and elsewhere.

1,"Hedge funds remained overweight growth stocks in the fourth quarter, helping to boost their aggregate performance as the market rocketed higher. Some of the names most popular with retail investors are among hedge funds’ favorites too, including            Amazon.com,Microsoft,      and            Netflix.Uber Technologies      was the stock bought by the most number of hedge funds last quarter, according to data from Goldman Sachs.Hedge funds’ growth tilt boosted their returns in recent months, while the fast-growing stocks led the market higher. The most popular hedge fund positions are now Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN),            Facebook      (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL). Other well known stocks are high on the list, as well, including            Salesforce.com      (CRM) at sixth, Netflix (NFLX) at 10th,            Apple      (AAPL) at 12th, and Tesla (TSLA) at 43rd.Within 45 days of the end of each quarter, hedge funds must report their portfolio holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regulatory form known as a 13F. Goldman Sachs analysts have reviewed the holdings of 859 hedge funds that managed $2.3 trillion at the start of this year. Top value holdings for hedge funds in the fourth quarter included            Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK.B) and several big banks:            Citigroup      (C),            Bank of America      (BAC), and            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM). Overall, though, hedge funds are holding pricey stocks. “Our Hedge Fund VIP basket currently carries a 33% price-to-earnings premium to the broad S&P 500 (25x vs. 19x), the largest on record,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in their report. The 50 stocks—which the Goldman Sachs analysts call the Very Important Positions basket—returned 24% from the start of the fourth quarter until last week, while the        S&P 500      index rose 14%.Source: Goldman SachsThe most concentrated ownership by hedge funds in S&P 500 stocks is in            Incyte      (INCY) and            Expedia Group      (EXPE), each with at least 20% of their market value owned by hedge funds. Meanwhile,            First Republic Bank      (FRC) and Dow (            DOW      ) have been all but ignored by hedge funds, On a sector level, managers slightly increased their positioning in information-technology stocks, which remained their greatest portfolio weight on aggregate. Tech stocks made up 19.9% of aggregate assets, though that’s below the Russell 3000’s 22.0% tech sector weight.Compared with the wide-ranging        Russell 3000      index, hedge funds are most overweight consumer discretionary, which represents 15.3% of their combined holdings, almost 5 percentage points more than the index. Health care is the next greatest relative overweight, while financials and consumer staples are the most out-of-favor sectors.Hedge funds increased their tilt toward consumer discretionary the most in the fourth quarter, while reducing financials and energy—which became a hedge fund underweight to the Russell 3000 for the first time since 2007.The favorite new buy of hedge funds in the fourth quarter was Uber Technologies (UBER). That appears to have been a good call: The ride-hailing firm’s stock struggled after its initial public offering earlier last year, but it’s rebounded sharply in 2020. It had been among the most exited positions by hedge funds in the third quarter.Other big new buys include Tiffany (TIF), Expedia,            Home Depot      (HD),            Exxon Mobil      (XOM), and            Nvidia      (NVDA). The list of reduced positions last quarter is topped by            Signature Bank      (SBNY),            PG&E      (PCG), and Fox (FOXA).Following the smart money has been a winning strategy over the past 18 years, according to Goldman. Since 2002, the stocks that saw the largest number of new hedge-fund investors in a quarter outperformed other stocks in their sector by an average of 0.52 percentage point in the following quarter.The Goldman team found the reverse holds true, as well: Stocks with the largest decline in the number of hedge-fund owners in a quarter have underperformed their sector peers by 0.60 percentage point over the next quarter.Here are the top 10 new adds and most exited positions by hedge funds in the third quarter:Source: Goldman SachsSource: Goldman Sachs Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.comHedge funds remained overweight growth stocks in the fourth quarter, helping to boost their aggregate performance as the market rocketed higher.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

On Monday,        iShares PHLX Semiconductor       exchange-traded fund (ticker: SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor sector index, fell nearly 5% after reports of further coronavirus infections outside of China, including in South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Earlier this month, Nvidia reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter and gave guidance for its current quarter ahead of Wall Street expectations. But Wong says the chip maker may be underestimating the risk of the virus outbreak. Consequently, he lowered his rating for Nvidia shares (NVDA) on Monday to Reduce from Neutral. “In our view, the risks to the global semiconductor industry posed by the COVID-19 outbreak have grown over the last few weeks,” he wrote. “We consider NVIDIA’s gaming GPUs and Nintendo Switch based chips to be consumer discretionary items. We think the economic dislocations resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak pose risk to demand in most electronic end markets.”The analyst cited how Nvidia’s gaming chip business accounts for more than half of the company’s revenue. He also noted the chip maker faces increased competition from            Advanced Micro Devices       (AMD) this year in the graphics chip market. Wong lowered his price target for the shares to $230 from $235. Nvidia stock was down 4.2% to $261.74 on Tuesday morning, while the S&P 500 was down 0.9%. The company declined to comment on the analyst report.Other Wall Street analysts are generally positive on Nvidia.

0,"Semiconductor stocks have soared over the past year in anticipation of a rebound for the sector. But Instinet analyst David Wong says the market may be misjudging the potential negative effects from the coronavirus outbreak on the chip industry. On Monday, equity markets fell after reports of further coronavirus infections outside of China, including in South Korea, Italy, and Iran.“While there has been a lot of attention on the supply chain disruptions associated with COVID-19, we think that many investors, and companies, may have underestimated the risk of the current issues impacting end market demand,” Wong wrote in a note to clients Sunday. “We remain cautious on the chip industry overall and selective in our chip and chip equipment stock picks.”The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor sector index, had risen more than 30% over the past year. On Monday, the ETF fell about 4%.The analyst noted how Analog Devices warned last week that the virus outbreak was affecting demand from its China-based industrial and automotive customers, while also slowing the rollout of 5G in China.Shares of chip makers            Micron Technology      (MU),            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) all declined more than 4% Monday.

The analyst had downgraded the stock last February.“With the stock almost exactly back to prior peak levels, it is obvious that not growing more constructive, sooner, was an error,” he wrote. “Overall though, we believe, potential forthcoming product cycles, resumption of hyperscale cloud computing spending, and potential near-term catalysts, the stock has potential to continue upward from here, even after the solid run.”The analyst is optimistic over Nvidia’s next generation of graphics technology, code-named Ampere, which he believes should do better than the current Turing-based models. He said the stock’s valuation is “rich,” but below prior peaks. Rasgon raised his price target for the shares to $360 from $300.

Apple (ticker: AAPL) also said demand for its product inside of China is being affected as well. Hong Kong’s        Hang Seng Index      fell 1.5%, leaving it down about 1% for the week after rising Monday. U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for the President’s Day holiday.

Stock in food company            Conagra Brands      (CAG) lost about 4%. The drop isn’t because of the virus. The company, however, like Apple, provided a disappointing update to investors Monday. “Consumption softness in the quarter first emerged in the food service industry, with holiday restaurant traffic weaker than last year.” said CEO Sean Connolly in the company’s news release. Conagra now expects to earn about $2.04 a share for the 2020 fiscal year ending in May. Analysts’ financial models predicted $2.10 in per-share earnings. It isn’t all bad news Tuesday morning.

1,"Nvidia      stock jumped in late trading Thursday after the graphic chip company posted better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter. For the quarter ended January 26, Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) reported revenue of $3.11 billion, up 41% from a year ago, and ahead of the company’s guidance of $2.95 billion give or take 2%. Non-GAAP earnings of $1.89 a share were well ahead of the Street estimates at $1.67 a share.For the first quarter, Nvidia sees revenue of $3 billion, ahead of the previous Wall Street analyst consensus at $2.85 billion. The company says it has reduced its guidance for the quarter by about $100 million to reflect the potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak.The company said the outlook doesn’t reflect the pending acquisition of            Mellanox Technologies.      Nvidia said discussions about the deal with China’s regulators are continuing and the company still expects to close the deal in early 2020. In remarks prepared for the company’s quarterly conference call with investors, CFO Colette Kress disclosed that revenue was up 56% in the gaming sector, 43% in data center, and 13% in professional visualization. The graphics process business was up 40% year over year and 8% sequentially. She said the company’s Tegra processor business which includes automotive, gaming, and AI applications, was up 47% year over year, but off 26% sequentially.She said the company will resume its stock repurchase program after completion of the Mellanox transaction.Nvidia stock in late trading was up 6.1% to $287.35.

0,"Nvidia      stock has spiked 15% year to date as expectations grow for a fundamental recovery at the graphics-chip leader. Progress will be a little clearer Thursday, when the company posts its latest financial results. One wild card for the rally is whether the company’s April quarter guidance will be tempered by the potential impact of coronavirus on the technology supply chain.For the quarter ended in January, the final three months of its fiscal year, Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) has projected revenue of $2.95 billion, plus or minus 2%, while the consensus among Wall Street analysts is for $2.97 billion. The company doesn’t provide earnings forecasts, but the Street consensus for profits stands at $1.67 a share. For the current quarter, analysts expect $2.85 billion in revenue and profits of $1.52 a share. The consensus view for the January 2021 fiscal year is for $12.84 billion in revenue and profits of $7.26 a share.Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore wrote in a research note Tuesday that he would not be surprised if the company produced a beat-and-raise quarter. Seymore says the PC and gaming sectors might be a little better than previous expectations and that “datacenter should be an area of strength.”The analyst wrote that he remains impressed with the company’s ability to address an array of rapidly growing sectors, including artificial intelligence, datacenters, gaming, and autonomous driving. On Tuesday, he increased his target price on the stock to $220, from $190, leaving it well below the current level. On Wednesday, the shares were up 1.3% to $271.36, fractionally below the 52-week high.Seymour kept his Hold rating on the stock. After a 77% run for the stock last year and further gains this year, Seymore wrote, “we believe much of this goodness is already priced in the shares.”Citi analyst Atif Malik likewise sees upside to both the January quarter report and April quarter guidance, driven in part by improved demand from the large cloud-computing companies. He thinks the gaming sector will be down seasonally, with some added risk due to production delays in China for the Nintendo Switch gaming platform. Malik kept his Buy rating on Nvidia but left his target price at $245, well below the current level.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a Positive rating on Nvidia shares, also expects a strong quarter, driven by the datacenter sector. But he cautioned in a report Wednesday that guidance for the first quarter is harder to predict, “and depends on management’s level of conservatism around the coronavirus.” Rolland raised his target on the stock to $310 from $285.

1,"AT&T is the latest major company to cancel planned participation in the coming Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona on concerns about the continuing spread of novel coronavirus. AT&T’s (ticker: T) decision Tuesday came on the heels of Cisco Systems and            Intel’s      announcements to back out of the world’s biggest smartphone conference. “We value our participation in important industry groups like GSMA and deeply respect the steps they have already taken to protect attendees,” the telecom said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the most responsible decision is to withdraw our participation from the event to safeguard our employees and customers.” Cisco (ticker: CSCO) said in a statement Tuesday: “Our company sincerely appreciates everything that Mobile World Congress has done to protect its attendees, and we look forward to participating in future events. We continue to keep those directly impacted by this situation in our thoughts and prayers.”Intel (INTC) said its employees and partners’ well-being “is our top priority, and we have withdrawn from this year’s Mobile World Congress out of an abundance of caution.”The number of companies that have backed out of the world’s biggest smartphone conference, scheduled to start later this month, is growing by the day. Here’s the current list of the companies that have canceled their participation, as of Monday night:The China-based tech companies ZTE and TCL have canceled planned news conferences, but still plan to participate in the event.As of Sunday, there were no plans to cancel the conference, which most years attracts more than 100,000 attendees from around the world. The GSMA, a trade association which sponsors the event, seems determined to carry on, despite the growing number of defections. “The GSMA knows that the coronavirus has created disruption, in particular for exhibitors and attendees from around the world, including the 5-6,000 (5-6%) who have historically attended from China,” the group said in a blog post. “Our sympathy goes to all those affected...Today, the GSMA is moving ahead as planned and will host MWC Barcelona 24-27 February 2020. While the GSMA confirm some large exhibitors have decided not to come to the show this year with others still contemplating next steps, we remain more than 2,800 exhibitors strong.”That said, as more companies pull out—and the pattern suggests the list is going to lengthen in the coming days—there will be growing questions about the wisdom of holding the show this year as scheduled if there is even modest risk to exhibitors and attendees.

1," 12:36 p.m. Advanced Micro Devices is climbing Monday, and could end the day at an all-time high—despite the risks posed by coronavirus. AMD (ticker: AMD) has jumped 4.5% to $51.99, though there is little news that would seem to be moving the stock. In fact, the only piece is see is an unconfirmed report on Benzinga that its chips could replace            Intel’s      in            Apple’s      (AAPL) iPhone. Intel stock is down 0.4% to $65.74.AMD isn’t the only stock showing strength Monday.

Broadcom      (AVGO), though, is off 0.9% at $312.25.What about coronavirus? Well, it seems that the market just isnt that worried. Yes, Apple is down after a report raised concerns about the impact of delays at Foxconn on iPhone sales, but just 0.1% to $319.60. So not much worry. And for now, there doesn’t seem to be much worry emanating from the chip makers themselves. “While several chip companies have noted that the coronavirus outbreak creates risk, there has not been any major semiconductor company so far, to our knowledge, that has confirmed any major impact to its business as yet. Memory spot prices appear to be holding fairly steady,” writes Nomura analyst David Wong. “Nevertheless, we continue to think that coronavirus might pose a risk to semiconductor sales in 2020.”Just not yet.

1,"Oracle      posted financial results for its fiscal third quarter, ended Feb. 29, that were in line with expectations.  The company reported revenues of $9.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago, and right in line with the company’s guidance for growth of 1% to 3%. Non-GAAP profits were 97 cents a share, at the top end of the guidance range of 95 to 97 cents a share.“Cloud services and license support” revenue—basically the company’s subscription-software business—was up 4%. “Cloud license and on-premise license” revenue, the more traditional software business model, was down 2%. Hardware revenue was down 6%, and services revenue was down 1%.The enterprise-software giant also announced a $15 billion increase in its stock-buyback plan.Oracle CEO Safra Catz said on a call with investors that the company sees May-quarter revenue ranging from down 2% to up 2%, with non-GAAP profits of $1.20 to $1.28 a share. Street consensus has been $11.3 billion, up 1.5%, and non-GAAP profits of $1.23 a share. Catz says that the guidance range is wider than normal due to the uncertainty associated with the Covid-19 outbreak. She added that the company doesn’t expect to see a significant impact from the virus on the subscription portion of its business. Catz also notes that the company bought back $4 billion of stock in the quarter, bringing the past 12 months’ repurchases to $20 billion. She notes that over the past five years, the company has reduced its share count by 28%.In late trading, Oracle stock was up 3.2% to $41.05.

All Rights ReservedWith the stock market in full freak-out mode, most investors are ignoring analyst advice on individual issues—every stock now looks a lot cheaper than it was a month ago, or even a week ago. The news that matters is macro in nature—the focus is on the coronavirus outbreak, not incremental improvements in cash flow estimates. That dynamic has spurred some Wall Street pundits to get philosophical—and to coach investors on sticking to their guns on companies with compelling investment stories.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who covers a wide range of tech names, took the barbell approach in a research note this morning, trying to pull back to the 30,000-foot level, while also offering some practical suggestions on stocks to buy while everything is on sale.“Across the tech space the red screens are front and center for investors as the panic, fear, and worries about a coronavirus-driven economic downturn continue to pressure stocks across the board,” he writes. “Our investing philosophy in times of crisis is to do a bottoms up analysis and stress test the models of our top tech names/themes vs. a sensitivity in valuations. If stocks stick out with a green light based on this exercise and framework, we hand hold investors to buy these dips through this volatility, own the names for the other side of this panic, and see the forest through the trees on the fundamental drivers for the next decade in tech.”Ives thinks that a “surge of strategic and financial buyer driven M&A could be on the horizon over the coming months as valuations start to reach levels which can ignite a long-overdue deal frenzy that could start to put a floor on the software sector as well.” He thinks            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT), Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google,            IBM      (IBM),            Adobe      (ADBE) and            Oracle      (ORCL) could all look to take advantage of their strong balance sheets to beef up their cloud portfolios.Ives writes that he remains bullish on cloud computing, 5G wireless handsets, and cybersecurity. “Does an economic slowdown impact these models and valuations? The answer is a clear yes,” he writes. “However, looking past the fear and panic (and a potential short-lived economic dent/softness), we believe these high-priority areas of spending and business models have attractive risk/rewards looking ahead and we would be buying these tech names at current levels.”His picks: Write to Eric J.

0,"Oracle      will provide some new insights into the state of global enterprise-software demand—and the impact of the coronavirus—on Thursday afternoon, when the company reports financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended February.For the quarter, Oracle (ticker: ORCL) has projected revenue up 1%-3% from a year ago, with non-GAAP profit of 95-97 cents a share. Wall Street analyst consensus estimates call for revenue of $9.75 billion and profit of 96 cents a share.For the May quarter, Street consensus calls for revenue of $11.33 billion and profit of $1.23 a share. Oracle has projected full-year revenue will show growth higher than last year, with profit up by a double-digit percentage. Street consensus is for $39.93 billion and $3.88 a share, respectively. For fiscal 2021, consensus is $40.8 billion and $4.23 a share.Given that Oracle will be one of the first companies to report on financial results for a period that includes February—when the coronavirus spread rapidly—the results will get extra attention.Wedbush analyst Steve Koening points out in an earnings preview note that according to recent news reports, Oracle is cutting 1,300 European jobs, a development that he says suggests that its move to the cloud “is presenting structural challenges.”Koening says that “in the face of potential demand headwinds, any improved execution in Q3 probably won’t make much difference to investor sentiment and Oracle’s share price.” But he also notes that the stock is less volatile than software peers, and “looks like a reasonably defensive holding.”Patrick Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities, is keeping his Market Perform rating on Oracle shares heading into the quarter. “Investors will likely have two big questions,” he writes in a research note. “Are the macro-economic forces that have rocked the markets in the last three weeks causing enterprise software spending to slow—unfortunately, we think the answer to that question is yes.... And might Keith Block, who abruptly stepped down from his role as co-CEO of Salesforce two weeks ago, rejoin Oracle where he spent 26 years of his career?”UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe, who has a Neutral rating and a $57 price target on Oracle shares, says that she expects “the attention to be on whether the company is seeing any impacts from Covid-19 on sales cycles, particularly as Oracle’s significant license exposure means slower sales show up fairly quickly” on the income statement.Q3 won’t be affected much, she argues, but she sees “some risk to Q4 guidance as coronavirus adds uncertainty to the company’s ability to close large license deals in its typically-strongest May quarter.” Lowe expects that Oracle will back away from its previous call that this year’s growth will exceed last year’s. “Current valuation levels look undemanding,” she adds, “but we think multiple expansion remains unlikely until Oracle is able to show revenue growth acceleration and the macro picture clarifies.”Oracle stock is down 6.7%, at $45.32, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      is down 5%. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedThe enterprise-software sector isn’t going to be a haven from the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at both            Citigroup      and Jefferies weighed in on the group Wednesday morning, and both made wholesale estimate cuts for the enterprise-software companies they cover. These companies aren’t directly subject to supply-chain issues or reduced consumer demand, but they have an assortment of vulnerabilities nonetheless as the coronavirus dampens economic activity worldwide.Citi’s Walter Pritchard asserts that “the global reaction to the outbreak will cause some short-term impact on the ability of software companies to close business.” He notes that a number of companies report earnings this week—including            Adobe      (ticker: ADBE),            Oracle      (ORCL),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and            DocuSign      (DOCU)—which will provide a fresh look at the impact of the virus on software demand. He’s keeping a close eye on Adobe and Oracle, both of which report February quarters and which have “meaningful Japan exposure.”Pritchard sees the companies affected by both soft demand in Asia and risk to high-touch sales models as travel is curtailed and trade shows and meetings are canceled. He also expects a hit to more transactional revenue, like advertising. Companies more tied to recurring revenue, where selling is less required, will be less vulnerable, he says. Pritchard cut estimates for many, but not all, of the companies he covers, noting that the most significant cuts affect            Ceridian HCM      Holding (CDAY),            Check Point Software Technologies      (CHKP),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD),            Dynatrace      (DT),            Guidewire Software      (GWRE), MicroStrategy (MSTR),            Open Text      (OTEX),            PTC      (PTC),            Splunk      (SPLK),            SAP      (SAP), and            Zscaler      (ZS).In a similar vein, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill cut estimates for 40 companies in his coverage universe for their current fiscal years by 1%-3%. Thill notes that over the past few weeks, a number of companies have already made cautious comments on the outlook.Microsoft      (MSFT), for instance, warned that it won’t reach its previous target in its “More Personal Computing” segment, which includes Windows.            VMware      (VMW) cited virus-related impact on Asian demand, and            Zendesk      (ZEN) pointed to virus risk at a recent analyst day. And Thill notes that March quarter guidance from companies on a normal calendar reporting scheduled likely provided their outlook before the global outbreak, and could be at risk.Thill says companies with exposure to perpetual licenses and multiyear on-premise licenses are most at risk, as travel restrictions reduce the mobility and impact of software sales and support staff. He cites            Check Point,Commvault      (CVLT), Oracle,            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW),            SailPoint      (SAIL),            Tufin Software Technologies      (TUFN), and VMware as companies with high license-revenue exposure. He sees more limited impact for companies with lower touch sales and implementation models. In that group, he includes            Atlassian      (TEAM),            Bill.com      (BILL),            Cloudflare      (NET),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            HubSpot      (HUBS),            Dropbox      (DBX), and Zendesk. Thill says            Intuit      (INTU) is “one of our most defensive names, with subscription-based small business accounting and predictable tax business.” He also likes            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), since “worker mobility is a potential long-term driver of incremental licenses and could benefit from increased remote working near-term.”The Jefferies analyst adds that he would be wary of companies with elevated revenue multiples, which he argues could be more vulnerable to sharp declines. Companies he covers trading at more than 15 times the next 12 months’ revenue include            Bill.com      (BILL),            Shopify      (SHOP),            Datadog      (DDOG),            RingCentral      (RNG),            Paycom Software      (PAYC), Atlassian, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and            Smartsheet      (SMAR).Thill suggests software investors focus on companies with strong fundamental stories and high profitability, calling out Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit,            ServiceNow      (NOW), and Ring Central.Amid a sharp, broad market decline Wednesday, almost all software stocks are trading lower.

1,"Technology stocks led the market’s rally to record heights, but the largest tech names have been swept up by the recent selling wave. Most of the leading tech companies now at or near bear market declines, down roughly 20% from their mid-February highs.The        S&P 500 Information Technology      sector closed at 1440.20 on Monday, down exactly 20% from its Feb. 19 peak. The info tech sector doesn’t include all of big tech -- (            Facebook      ticker: FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are in the Communications Services sector, for instance -- but the pain is generally universally. Microsoft      (MSFT) and            Apple      (AAPL) are hanging on to their position as the only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion, but both have suffered in the recent selloff. Microsoft is down 4.5% year to date, and off more than 20% from its closing high in mid-February. Bear markets are defined as drops of 20% or more. Apple is down 9% year to date and almost 19% below its recent peak.Amazon      (AMZN) and Alphabet, both of which made brief appearances above the $1 trillion market level, have since fallen substantially. Amazon has performed relatively better than the other tech giants, but it’s still off 2.6% for the year and 17% from last month’s peak. Facebook (FB), the fifth largest U.S. company by market cap, is down 17% year to date, and 22% from its February highs.Cisco      (CSCO), the largest networking equipment company, is down 21% for the year and 24% from its February highs.            Intel      (INTC), the leading chip maker, is off 15% for the year and almost 25% from its peak last month. IBM      (IBM), which got a lift from its recent announcement of a CEO change, is still down 12% year to date, and 24% from the stock’s February high.            Oracle      (ORCL), which only fell 3% Monday, is down 13% year to date, and 17% from its recent peak.            Salesforce.com      (CRM) is off 7% for the year and 22% from a February high.Zoom Video Communications      (ZM), which has become a popular play on the rush to remote meetings in the face of the rapid spread of coronavirus, was down just a fraction on Monday and remains 67% higher on the year.            RingCentral      (RING), a unified communications company which resells Zoom’s videoconferencing services, fell 3% Monday, but it’s still up 24% for the year. Netflix      (NFLX), seen by some investors as a bet on more people choosing to find entertainment at home, was down 6% Monday, but it remains 7% higher for the year.            Roku (ROKU),      the other leading streaming play, is down 28%. On Monday, it fell 5.7% to $96.26, closing below $100 a share for the first time since September. Write to Eric J.

1,"Elon Musk deserves credit for Tesla’s decision, disclosed Thursday, to sell stock now that the shares have risen some 80% this year, to above $700. The surprising decision—Musk said on Jan. 29 that it didn’t make sense to raise money because Tesla would generate cash despite its rapid growth—is a great call for one simple reason. As anyone who has ever lost a job knows, you can only raise money when you don’t need it. It is far better to sell stock, or borrow money, from a position of strength. Tesla plans to sell about 2.7 million shares, raising about $2 billion in the process. The company says it will use the money to strengthen its balance sheet. Tesla has about $13 billion in debt on the books and about $6.9 billion net of cash on hand. Net debt is less than 2 times estimated 2020 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. That is lower than at the average company in the        S&P 500,      although car makers are tougher to analyze. Tesla, for instance, has some cash tied to its auto-insurance operations that it can’t spend to build factories.Less than a year ago, investors were concerned that the company might have to sell stock, given how fast it was burning through cash. Now, Tesla is in a stronger position. The company has generated cash in five of the past six quarters. Full-year 2019 free cash flow—operating cash minus capital spending—reached almost $1 billion. Shares fell 4% in premarket trading in response to news of the sale—after all, the move will dilute existing holders, and more volume to sell means pressure on prices—but rebounded for a gain of about 4% to about $801 by early afternoon. Still, bearish analysts are likely to point out that selling stock near current levels indicates Musk, and Tesla management, think the stock is fully valued. Shares, after all, are up about 80% year to date, crushing comparable gains of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      and        S&P 500.      Both Musk and Larry Ellison, a board member and the founder of            Oracle,      will participate in the new stock offering, putting money where their mouths are. Buying a little more stock doesn’t change Musk’s average cost to acquire shares all that much. And don’t forget, he also has stock options that will net him more than $50 billion, before taxes, if Tesla’s market value hits $650 billion. Thursday afternoon, it was at about $138 billion.Bullish analysts will point out that Tesla is a growth company and still needs cash to build capacity and launch new models. Growing companies often require cash. In the simplest terms, it costs a lot to build a plant, and cars—which generate sales—ship far after an assembly line is complete. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called the move “smart and strategic” in a Thursday research report. He rates shares the equivalent of Hold, but has a $710 price target of the stock. That’s one of the higher price targets on Wall Street. There is another, smaller, fundamental positive shareholders can reap from a stronger balance sheet: Cheaper debt. Tesla bonds rallied on the news of incoming cash, up about 0.3% Thursday. Tesla bonds have rallied in recent months, along with the stock, and now yield about 5%. The final price Tesla will sell the shares for isn’t known. It will be set by brokerage firms who will poll clients to build a book. Shares will likely come at a discount to recent trading levels.

1,"After 18 years, Golden Gate Capital is shedding its stake in Infor in a deal that values the enterprise-software company at roughly $13 billion. Koch Equity Development, the private-equity arm of Koch Industries, is buying the remaining 30 percent of Infor that it doesn’t already own. Financial terms weren’t announced. Infor, based in New York, had been widely expected to go public, Barron’s reported in January 2019. Instead, the tech company will become a stand-alone unit of Koch Industries. Infor will continue to be run by its current management team, led by CEO Kevin Samuelson. Infor employs 17,000 people and develops cloud enterprise-planning software. It has more than 68,000 customers in more than 170 countries. Competitors include            Oracle      (ticker: ORCL) and            SAP SE      (SAP). Golden Gate’s investment in Infor dates to 2002 when the San Francisco private-equity firm acquired Agilisys. Golden Gate changed the name of the portfolio company in 2004 when it bought Infor Business Solutions AG. During Golden Gate’s ownership, Infor completed 60 strategic acquisitions, including the $2 billion purchase of Lawson Software in 2011. The sale of Infor to Koch Equity Development is expected to close later this year. Golden Gate’s total return and net profit on Infor is $3 billion, a person familiar with the situation said. Golden Gate has more than $15 billion in committed capital. It invests in sectors such as consumer, industrials and financial services and in software, information systems and tech-enabled services. Unlike traditional PE firms, Golden Gate’s fund uses an evergreen structure. This means Golden Gate raises capital as it needs and isn’t required to sell portfolio companies within five to 10 years, as traditional private-equity firms do. “Golden Gate Capital founded and began building Infor 18 years ago,” David Dominik, co-founder of Golden Gate Capital, said in a statement. “We are selling our remaining stake to Koch Industries, our partner in Infor for the past three years, because of the significant strategic value between Infor and Koch.” Koch Equity invests the excess capital of Koch Industries, which produces more than $110 billion in revenue annually. Koch Equity splits its deals between strategic acquisitions and principal investments. Solera and Getty Images are examples of principal deals. Koch Equity invested $2 billion in Infor in February 2017. In January 2019, it and Golden Gate provided an additional $1.5 billion. “Software is no longer an industry vertical; it is a disruptive layer that is transforming every facet of society,” Jim Hannan, executive vice president and CEO of enterprises for Koch Industries, said in the statement. A spokesperson for Koch couldn’t be reached for further comment.

1,"Curiosity struck while I was on the computer, and this time it had nothing to do with how magnets are made or whether whales sneeze. The        S&P 500      index has shot 39% higher since Christmas Eve 2018, the low point during a gloomy patch that year. Earnings have barely grown over that stretch, so the index’s forward price/earnings ratio has swelled nearly as quickly, to 18.4 from 13.7. I wondered if there are companies whose P/Es have come down over the same period, not because their shares have tumbled, but because their earnings outlooks have outpaced their stock prices. So I put on my stock-screening playlist, skipped past Chicago’s “(I’ve Been) Searchin’ So Long,” went right to “Finders Are Keepers” by Hank Williams Jr., and had at the data. I eliminated pipsqueaks and extreme stinkers by restricting my search to S&P 500 members that have gained at least 20% since two Christmases ago. Off the list came companies like            Macy’s      (ticker: M), which was down 42% but whose P/E is down only 5% because its earnings estimates have collapsed, too. I ignored companies like            Netflix      (NFLX), whose earnings have soared in percentage terms, but not in dollars, because of a low base. The answer to my question, it turns out, is not really. There isn’t much in the way of stocks that have gotten cheaper while climbing. So I settled for companies whose P/Es have inflated only modestly—less than half as much in percentage terms as their stock prices. There were a handful. Discovery (DISCA) is home to Food Network, Animal Planet, HGTV, and other cable channels, and so is directly exposed to viewers migrating from cable bundles to streaming services. Hence, the humble stock price of under eight times earnings. But Discovery is building a streaming business of its own, including Food Network Kitchen, GolfTV, and a platform for science and nature shows. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Steven Cahall guesstimates these niche streaming services could bring in 27% of revenue and 7% of operating income before depreciation and amortization, without cannibalizing its existing cable business, by 2025.The risk facing Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is long-term in nature but not to be taken lightly: Morgan Stanley estimates that 87% of the revenue the company will bring in by 2023 will be at risk from generic and biosimilar competition by 2030. That makes developing or buying new blockbuster drugs a must, even after its recently closed acquisition of Celgene. It bodes well that the company is expected to generate free cash equal to 8% of its stock-market value this year, rising to 13% by 2023. Shares trade at less than 11 times earnings. Wall Street isn’t a fan of tech dinosaur Oracle (ORCL), with just eight of 34 analysts who cover the stock recommending a purchase. Stock buybacks and careful expense control have kept earnings growing at double-digit percentages in recent years. What’s needed now is a shift to something higher than low-single-digit revenue growth, but that could take more spending, so shares are stuck below 14 times earnings. The bull case holds that Oracle will continue to move its massive base of customers for databases and applications to cloud services with recurring revenues and healthy margins. The free-cash-flow yield is pegged at 7% to 8% in coming years. A scraggly bunch, perhaps, but the prices are low. With respect to Hank Jr., keepers are getting harder to find.

0,"It might be time for            Microsoft      to go shopping. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin asserts in a research note Thursday that 2020 could be a defining year for the software giant. He argues that Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) has “a unique opportunity to further elevate its cloud leadership position through share gains and needle-moving M&A.” The company’s huge run to a $1 trillion-plus valuation has been driven by the remarkable growth in its Azure cloud business, which is smaller than            Amazon.com’s      (AMZN) Amazon Web Services but growing faster—and Bracelin thinks the company can press its advantage with a smart deals. Read Next: The Dow Could Hit 30,000 Five Years Ahead of Schedule. It Won’t Stop There. Bracelin today repeated his Buy rating on Microsoft shares, lifting his target price to $190 from $158. The Piper analyst writes that with $67 billion in net cash and another $200 billion of projected future free cash flow over the next three years, “M&A could take center stage in 2020.” He notes that Microsoft has less than 5% market share in business application software, giving the company “many options” to boost its position in the enterprise beyond Azure, LinkedIn, Office 365, and GitHub.Bracelin points out that Microsoft has grown 8.5% on average over the past decade, but contends that the company is poised to see growth accelerate to a 12% annual rate over the next three years, driven by its cloud business. He notes that the company’s commercial cloud business has grown to 35% of revenue from 14% years three years ago, and that the total should top 50% by fiscal 2023, as the company’s cloud revenues eclipse $100 billion.He sees multiple drivers for potential upside performance by Microsoft this year, including cloud momentum, further expansion in the security software market, and the debut of the first new Xbox console in seven years. There are some offsets, though, he cautions—including the continuing shortage of            Intel      (INTC) microprocessors, which could affect Windows revenue, and the conclusion of the recent Windows upgrade cycle, with the termination of support for Windows 7.So what might Microsoft buy? “After applying Microsoft’s acquisition philosophy and framework across the business application software universe, we have identified potential acquisition targets that we would deem to be needle-moving pursuits,” Bracelin writes. With the caveat that there is zero evidence that any of these proposed deals are actually in the works—nor is anyone asserting they are—here’s his list of 10 potential targets:Microsoft stock is up 0.2%, at $166.01, in recent trading.

1,"Tech stocks had a great year in 2019, and institutional investors remain bullish on the sector for 2020—maybe a little too bullish.That’s one of the conclusions of a recent investor survey conducted by Wolfe Research tech strategist Steve Milunovich. He writes in a research note Friday that Wolfe expects high single-digit overall stock market returns this year driven by central bank easing, moderating trade tensions with China and the probability of a moderate Democratic Presidential nominee. The tech sector, he adds, should do well in that environment. But Milunovich adds that he’s recommending a market weighting in tech shares, asserting that the sector is “overbought near term,” that earnings expectations may be too high for 2020, and that the “malinvestment created by money printing” will come home to roost, perhaps in 2021 rather than 2020.Milunovich finds other warning signs. “The stock market cap-to-GDP ratio is about 150%, the highest since 2000, and a number of valuation metrics are near extreme levels,” he writes. “Central banks’ easiness is a source of near-term support but long-term risk. We would argue that easy money led to the bubbles of 2000 and 2008 and that we may be in the midst of a credit bubble.” And he points out that tech stock valuations are at the highest they’ve been since 2000. His research note includes a list of 39 companies trading for more than 10 times next 12 months sales—most of them enterprise software companies.Nonetheless, Milunovich reports that his latest tech investor survey found 67% of respondents bullish on the market, with 6% bearish and none “very bearish.” In the survey, investors were asked to name their favorite stocks—and their least favorite. As for the stocks investors like the least, the roster is dominated by legacy tech.The survey also asked about tech trends. “The hottest tech trend is 5G,” he writes. “Marketing of 5G handsets could lift sales later in 2020, but we think the real impact will be in enterprise IoT applications later. Public cloud continues to benefit hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud and their component suppliers while disadvantaging legacy vendors. AI is more ingredient than product but could prove highly disruptive. Investors seem calmer about regulation, which was the top issue last survey.” Write to Eric J.

1,"A publicly traded investment fund offers a good way for investors to play a wave of tech initial public offerings this year.GSV Capital,      which stands for Global Silicon Valley, trades at a discount of 30% to its year-end 2018 net asset value, or NAV, of $9.89 a share. Its fifth-biggest holding is Lyft, which is expected to go public this week. The largest holdings are            Spotify Technology,      Palantir Technologies, Coursera, and            Dropbox.BTIG analyst Mark Palmer has noted that GSV’s stock “has historically performed well in the face of an improving market for IPOs.” He carries a Buy rating and a price target of $11.50 a share based on a valuation of one times projected year-end 2019 NAV. The stock closed on Thursday at $7.32.GSV seeks to invest in late-stage private companies and sell them within 18 months of their IPOs. Its top 10 positions represented 86% of the overall portfolio at the end of 2018, up from 75% at the end of 2017. So why does GSV trade at a steep discount to its NAV? Investors may question the accuracy of its private valuations. It realized a loss of $9.3 million on the sale of an investment in Lytro, a virtual-reality camera maker, in the third quarter. Still, Lyft looks to be carried below its future public market value.GSV offers retail investors one of the few ways to access a basket of late-stage private companies—and its shares trade at a nice discount to the value of its portfolio.--—Andrew BaryRed Hat reports quarterly results.Dominion Energy      hosts its 2019 Investor Day Meetings and will update shareholders about its ESG initiatives.The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago releases its Chicago Fed National Activity Index for February.

0," La Dolce Vita. U.S. stocks shrugged off renewed concerns about Italy, and kept on gaining in surreal fashion. The Dow led the way, while the Nasdaq was flat. Volatility is near historic lows. In today’s Intraday Update, we…  There Is No End… U.S. stocks remain large and in charge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 169 points, or 0.64%, to 26,820.01, the S&P 500 climbed 0.21% to 2930.76, and the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 8036.76.The market continues to climb as if the sweet life will never end, because there’s little evidence to suggest otherwise. U.S. stocks bucked the historical trend and showed strength in September. Year to date, the S&P 500 continues to beat the rest of the world by a significant margin. Growth continues to outperform. Sector-wise, technology and consumer discretionary have led the way, while staples and materials have dragged.Two sectors to keep overweight tech and financials, says Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch.Technology stocks still have momentum, and momentum has been the best-performing style ahead of stock market peaks, she notes. In addition, fundamentals in the sector are good with the sector logging the highest earnings per share and sales beats of all 11 sectors since 2000. It’s also the only sector with net cash. Financials also stand to get a boost as their payout ratios return to normal levels, which have historically been associated with big bumps in price-to-book ratios, says Subramanian. Since financials were prohibited from buying back shares until recently, buybacks have only just started to tick up. Increased automation and tech could also help margins. These two sector preferences stem from Subramanian’s view on “medium duration” stocks. “The rationale is that since 2009, short duration stocks (high payout, no growth bond proxies) and long duration stocks (high growth, no payout ‘buy the dream’ stocks) have both been bid up on scarcity value amidst persistently low yields and low growth,” she explains. “Today, with positive trends in both U.S. earnings and the economy, and with cash yields growing more competitive to equity yield, ‘medium duration’ sectors should benefit.”Sectors Subramanian underweights include utilities and real estate, which follow the same logic. Big picture, U.S. stocks still stand to climb. “Statistics such as the various tick averages and open interest figures for futures I track suggest that enough capital sits parked on the sidelines with the ability to drag equities higher,” says Jeremy Klein, chief strategist at FBN Securities. There’s no end to this good life, at least for now.  Midday Movers Chevron (CVX) is up 0.6% to $125.09 after Goldman Sachs added it to the firm’s Conviction Buy list. Morgan Stanley (MS) is down 0.7% to $46.31 after HSBC Securities downgraded the stock to Hold.Paychex      (PAYX) is up 1.3% to $74.65 after reporting first-quarter earnings. The payroll and human-resources firm earned 67 cents a share on revenue or $862.8 million. Analysts were looking for earnings of 66 cents on revenue of $850.39 million.Skechers      (SKX) is down 1.5% to $26.89 after            Citigroup      downgraded it to Neutral.Tronc      (TRNC) is up 2% to $16.37 on a report from the New York Post that McClatchy is in early discussions to make a bid for the publisher. —Teresa Rivas Write to Crystal Kim at crystal.kim@barrons.com La Dolce Vita.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Mark Oelschlager, the manager of Oak Associates’        Pin Oak Equity      fund, has shown he can be a good shepherd in good times and bad. The $246.4 million fund, which has earned a five-star rating from Morningstar, is ranked No. 1 in its large blend category for the past 10 and 15 years, and has outperformed both its peers and the S&P 500 for the past three, five, 10, and 15 years. The no-load fund charges annual fees of 0.97%. The 49-year-old Oelschlager, who has been at the helm of the fund (ticker: POGSX) since 2005, is currently looking for underpriced defensive stocks—however hard they may be to find—given how late we are in the economic cycle and amid increasing trade worries. He’s not afraid to take big bets, with more than 45% of the fund’s assets in its top 10 holdings. With a mere 8% annual turnover, Oelschlager—the son of Oak Associates founder Jim Oelschlager—invests with a long-term perspective, hunting for mispriced companies that he believes have shown durable competitive advantages. Today, he sees opportunity in a number of areas, from Google parent            Alphabet      (GOOGL) to            Hanesbrands      (HBI). Read on for excerpts from his conversation with Barron’s.   Barron’s: Are there any holdings you can highlight that exemplify your investment strategy?  Oelschlager: We could start with            Bank of New York      Mellon (BK), which is one of our bigger holdings. This is a trust bank, one of the largest, and there are big advantages to scale in the trust business. It would be very difficult for another player to come in and replicate what Bank of New York has built. It really has a consistent business that is based on assets under custody, and you only have to pay about 13 times earnings for that right now. The company has been hurt by low interest rates, and that made the stock very cheap a couple of years ago. Even though it’s rallied since then, it still looks attractive, in our opinion. And interest rates have started to rise, with potentially more to come this year.  Well, nobody can predict the direction of interest rates, but I think that is certainly a potential catalyst for a higher stock price. But we think at the current valuations, you don’t necessarily have to count on higher interest rates. I’d like to talk about Alphabet, because it’s such a high-profile company and one of your largest holdings.  Alphabet has built the world’s leading search engine, and obviously internet search is something that people are using more and more every day. Google in entrenched there because of the nature of the way its search engine works—it gets better the more it’s used. So that dominance tends to feed on itself. It’s been able to leverage that dominance to create a huge advertising business. It’s been growing the top line consistently around 20% for several years. Earnings growth has been similarly strong and the stock has done well, but it is still only trading at a mid-20s price/earnings ratio, which for that growth rate and that durability is, I think, still well justified. It has some other businesses that have been gaining traction—You Tube has been a tremendous success—and so that should help to propel their growth going forward. PepsiCo      (PEP) is one of the few consumer-staples stocks in the fund.  We like having some stability in the portfolio, especially given how deep into the economic cycle we are and also given the elevated risk of a trade war, which would disrupt the economy. So that’s a big reason that we’ve held on to Pepsi, but also we just think it is a good business. Everybody is familiar with their soda business, but snacks actually are just as big for them, and that is a consistent growth business: While the cola business is facing some secular headwinds in terms of consumers’ tastes, the snack business is still relatively healthy, and you are only paying around 20 times earnings for a company that’s been extremely consistent for decades. You recently added Hanesbrands and            H&R Block      (HRB) to the portfolio. What made you decide to buy them? Well, they are both good businesses, but it is also a case of, again, wanting to add stability to the portfolio. We think, just in general, risks are rising in the market and in the economy, and so the new stocks that we’ve been adding recently have been more toward the defensive side. It has been difficult to find attractive defensive names because many of them became quite overvalued a couple of years ago, as investors were so hungry for dividend yield that they really paid up for the companies that pay high dividends, and those tend to be the stable companies. We avoided stability a couple of years ago, but today we’re gravitating toward it, although, like I said, many of the defensive stocks are still not attractive. But these are a couple of stocks that I think are. They do offer value. Hanesbrands and H&R Block are both steady companies with predictable results. You know people are going to buy underwear regardless of what the economy is doing, and the stock is about 12 times earnings—and it’s always had healthy returns on capital. With H&R Block, you have, just like with Hanesbrands, high returns on capital and a high free-cash-flow yield. I mentioned with            Paychex,      how sticky the business can be. and also with Bank of New York; for H&R Block you can say the same thing. Once you start doing your taxes with them, you don’t want to switch. You want to keep going back to them year after year because they have your information, so it is just easier to deal with them than to switch to a competitor. The stock has been knocked down recently because of a perception that the tax code has become simpler, and so the thinking is that people won’t need the services of H&R Block as much. I think there is a little bit of truth to that, but I think it’s been overdone and that the stock is attractive at this price.  Any other stocks you want to mention? Paychex (PAYX) is the leading payroll processor in the small-business market. When a client signs up with Paychex, it tends to be sticky business. It is difficult to switch, which gives Paychex some leverage in terms of its pricing power, so it is able to raise prices consistently year after year. It’s grown for several years. It’s grown in the mid- to upper-single digits on the top line, and much of that drops to the bottom line. Its free cash flow has grown steadily over the years, and even with the strong performance of the stock, the free-cash-flow yield is still about 4.5%, which higher than what the market is offering at this time.

0,"The enterprise-software sector isn’t going to be a haven from the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at both            Citigroup      and Jefferies weighed in on the group Wednesday morning, and both made wholesale estimate cuts for the enterprise-software companies they cover. These companies aren’t directly subject to supply-chain issues or reduced consumer demand, but they have an assortment of vulnerabilities nonetheless as the coronavirus dampens economic activity worldwide.Citi’s Walter Pritchard asserts that “the global reaction to the outbreak will cause some short-term impact on the ability of software companies to close business.” He notes that a number of companies report earnings this week—including            Adobe      (ticker: ADBE),            Oracle      (ORCL),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and            DocuSign      (DOCU)—which will provide a fresh look at the impact of the virus on software demand. He’s keeping a close eye on Adobe and Oracle, both of which report February quarters and which have “meaningful Japan exposure.”Pritchard sees the companies affected by both soft demand in Asia and risk to high-touch sales models as travel is curtailed and trade shows and meetings are canceled. He also expects a hit to more transactional revenue, like advertising. Companies more tied to recurring revenue, where selling is less required, will be less vulnerable, he says. Pritchard cut estimates for many, but not all, of the companies he covers, noting that the most significant cuts affect            Ceridian HCM      Holding (CDAY),            Check Point Software Technologies      (CHKP),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD),            Dynatrace      (DT),            Guidewire Software      (GWRE), MicroStrategy (MSTR),            Open Text      (OTEX),            PTC      (PTC),            Splunk      (SPLK),            SAP      (SAP), and            Zscaler      (ZS).In a similar vein, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill cut estimates for 40 companies in his coverage universe for their current fiscal years by 1%-3%. Thill notes that over the past few weeks, a number of companies have already made cautious comments on the outlook.Microsoft      (MSFT), for instance, warned that it won’t reach its previous target in its “More Personal Computing” segment, which includes Windows.            VMware      (VMW) cited virus-related impact on Asian demand, and            Zendesk      (ZEN) pointed to virus risk at a recent analyst day. And Thill notes that March quarter guidance from companies on a normal calendar reporting scheduled likely provided their outlook before the global outbreak, and could be at risk.Thill says companies with exposure to perpetual licenses and multiyear on-premise licenses are most at risk, as travel restrictions reduce the mobility and impact of software sales and support staff. He cites            Check Point,Commvault      (CVLT), Oracle,            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW),            SailPoint      (SAIL),            Tufin Software Technologies      (TUFN), and VMware as companies with high license-revenue exposure. He sees more limited impact for companies with lower touch sales and implementation models. In that group, he includes            Atlassian      (TEAM),            Bill.com      (BILL),            Cloudflare      (NET),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            HubSpot      (HUBS),            Dropbox      (DBX), and Zendesk. Thill says            Intuit      (INTU) is “one of our most defensive names, with subscription-based small business accounting and predictable tax business.” He also likes            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), since “worker mobility is a potential long-term driver of incremental licenses and could benefit from increased remote working near-term.”The Jefferies analyst adds that he would be wary of companies with elevated revenue multiples, which he argues could be more vulnerable to sharp declines. Companies he covers trading at more than 15 times the next 12 months’ revenue include            Bill.com      (BILL),            Shopify      (SHOP),            Datadog      (DDOG),            RingCentral      (RNG),            Paycom Software      (PAYC), Atlassian, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and            Smartsheet      (SMAR).Thill suggests software investors focus on companies with strong fundamental stories and high profitability, calling out Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit,            ServiceNow      (NOW), and Ring Central.Amid a sharp, broad market decline Wednesday, almost all software stocks are trading lower.

0,"How a company’s stock reacts to its earnings report first and foremost depends on the quality of the results. But how the numbers come in relative to analysts’ expectations can be even more indicative of the way the stock reacts. And when investors have a strong view on a company’s upcoming trajectory going into an earnings report, any deviation can mean a sharp move in a stock’s price—sometimes seemingly counter to the actual reported results.For example, last Wednesday,            Facebook      (ticker: FB) posted 25% revenue growth and 8% profit growth for its latest quarter—both healthy increases for a company of its size and ahead of Wall Street consensus going into the report. But the social media giant had a high bar to hurdle. Facebook stock had well outperformed the market since it last reported earnings on Oct. 30, rising 19% versus a 7% gain for the        S&P 500      index. Just in the month before reporting, the stock and index rose 7% and 1%, respectively. Facebook also outpaced other technology stocks.That short-term optimism was clearly overblown. Facebook stock dropped over 6% on Thursday.There are 90 S&P 500 components releasing results this week. These are the ones that have climbed the most in the past month through Friday’s close, while the S&P 500 has returned less than 2%:Source: FactSetA couple of the biggest winners going into their earnings reports this week are defense stocks, like            L3Harris Technologies      (ticker: LHX), or suppliers of components to defense companies, like            TransDigm Group      (TDG). They both got a big bump in early January as Middle East tensions spiked, and escalating conflict between the U.S. and Iran looked likely. Management might be asked this week if they see a positive impact on their business going forward.Other stocks jumped due to specific one-time factors.            NortonLifeLock      (NLOK) saw its shares rise recently after it declared a special dividend.            Paycom Software      (PAYC) was added to the S&P 500 index in its latest reshuffling and saw buying from index funds.The stocks that have outperformed sharply over the past month without a clear catalyst—            Motorola Solutions      (MSI) or            FleetCor Technologies      (FLT)—are the ones to watch the most closely when they report this week. Investors are expressing their optimism by buying shares, and could still be disappointed by what is otherwise a strong report.Conversely, stocks that go into their earnings sitting on heavy recent losses might only need a slightly better-than-expected or in-line report to see a positive reaction.Here are this week’s reporters that have dropped the most over the past month:Source: FactSetHow a stock has performed before its earnings report of course can’t alone determine how the market will react to new information.

1,"U.S. stock futures are down in sympathy with overseas markets. Hong Kong’s        Hang Seng Index      fell 0.8% in Tuesday evening trading. Europe’s        FTSE 100 Index      is off 1% Wednesday morning. And        Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures are down 0.3%.        S&P 500 Index      futures have fallen 0.2% lower. Like the Dow,        Nasdaq Composite      futures are down 0.3%. Even though stocks are set to open in the red, investors should feel better about retailer earnings. Wednesday morning, for instance, home improvement retailer            Lowe’s      (ticker: LOW) reported third-quarter numbers that beat Wall Street expectations. For the company’s quarter ending in October, it earned $1.41 a share, a little better than the $1.35 figure Wall Street predicted. Comparable-store sales in the U.S. increased 3%, in line with analyst estimates. For the full year, Lowe’s management now expects to earn about $5.67, 12 cents higher than the midpoint of guidance given when reporting second-quarter numbers. Lowe’s numbers offer some relief because disappointing earnings guidance from peer            Home Depot      (HD) sent its stock down more than 5% on Tuesday. Target      (TGT) numbers also have investors happier on hump day. The mass retailer reported third-quarter per-share earnings of $1.36, better than the Wall Street consensus prediction of $1.19. Target stock is up more than 9% in premarket trading. Like Lowe’s versus Home Depot, Target’s numbers were far better than            Kohl’s      (KSS).            Kohl’s      stock slid 19.5% on Tuesday after earnings missed analyst expectations. Kohl’s shares are down another 1.8% in premarket trading Wednesday after Goldman Sachs downgraded shares from the equivalent of Buy to Hold. Outside of the retail sector, stock in tech firm            Paycom Software      (PAYC) might move. RBC analyst Alex Zukin upgraded shares to the equivalent of Buy from Hold. He took his price target to $278 a share, up from $230.

We believe these recent developments could be disruptive for ADP, particularly within its Employer Services (ES) business (approximate $8.5 billion net revenues), which could have positive implications for its competitors including Ultimate Software (ULTI) (rated at Outperform, $245 target price), Workday (WDAY) (rated at Neutral, $94 target price) and Paycom (PAYC) (rated at Outperform, $78 target price).AT&T      (T) (not rated) is exploring sale of its connected home security business, which we view as a net positive for            Alarm.com Holdings      (ALRM). Last week, multiple news sources reported that AT&T is exploring the potential sale of its Digital Life connected home-security business in order to pay down debt related to the planned acquisition of          Time Warner      (TWX) (rated at Outperform). We believe this could bode well for Alarm (rated at Outperform, $46 target price), as the sale could lead to disruption at one of Alarm’s few remaining large competitors; AT&T is estimated to have 400,000-500,000 customers on its Digital Life platform.Last week, Gartner published its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises, which advanced Ultimate Software to a “Leader” from a “Challenger” and maintained Workday as a “Leader.” Specifically, Gartner distinguished Ultimate Software for its: 1) employee-focused/customer-centric culture that fosters high retention and consistent growth; 2) strong vendor customer relationship (VCR) rating, which ranks well above its peers; and 3) high reference customer satisfaction, particularly on the overall product suite.Regarding Workday, Gartner praised the company’s: 1) natively developed application with a single security model and user experience; 2) robust core human resources (HR) functionality, which achieved the highest reference customer satisfaction score among peers; and 3) overall product quality and integration within its HCM suites. As we’ve highlighted in the past, we continue to believe that cloud-based HCM software vendors with best-of-breed capabilities will continue to take market share from the larger incumbent competitors. -- Michael Nemeroff  -- Alexander Hu  -- Christopher Rochester The opinions contained in Investors’ Soapbox in no way represent those of Barrons.com or Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0," Pacific Crest Securities The small- and medium-sized business (SMB) software-as-a-service (SaaS) group is coming in hot ahead of earnings next week, but our bias remains to the upside based on surprisingly strong first-quarter trends.We advise small-cap growth investors to use any market volatility to add to positions in SMB SaaS. Near term, we are most confident on            HubSpot      (ticker: HUBS),            Zendesk      (ZEN),          Shopify      (SHOP) and Square (SQ). We are also raising estimates on HubSpot and increasing our price target to $80. While robust SMB trends also bode well for          Mindbody      (MB),            Paycom Software      (PAYC) and            Paylocity      Holding (PCTY), these companies also have slightly higher company-specific risks.The sun is shining on SMB SaaS. We have seen a prolific rise in the number of SMB SaaS pure-plays that are just now beginning to reach critical mass and achieve positive free cash flow. Small-cap growth investors are noticing these trends: 11 SMB SaaS pure-plays have risen 38% year-to-date on average after rising 21% in 2016.Bottom line: These SMB SaaS pure-plays are poised to benefit from both margin and multiple expansion as fundamentals continue to improve.Another solid beat and raise by            RingCentral      (RNG) (not covered) on 32% year-over-year annual-run-rate growth also sets a positive tone going into earnings next week; HubSpot, Paycom and Shopify report on May 2, Square reports on May 3, Zendesk and Mindbody report on May 4.SMB demand is off to a surprisingly strong start. Small business confidence is the highest since 2004, per survey data from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). Feedback from partners and private companies has been surprisingly strong with first-quarter demand trends well above seasonal norms. Additionally, actual sales data in March across 700 survey participants have inflected positively, giving us greater confidence in sales-volume-driven upside for Square, Shopify and Mindbody.HubSpot, Zendesk, Shopify and Square appear best positioned in the first half. We are most confident about HubSpot, Shopify, Square and Zendesk, which appear best positioned to capitalize on improving SMB demand trends in the short run. We are also raising estimates for HubSpot and increasing our price target to $80. SMB strength also bodes well for Mindbody, Paycom and Paylocity, but these companies also have slightly more company-specific risk. Affordable Care Act repeal or reform debates add headline risk to Paycom and Paylocity, while Mindbody has forced churn through higher pricing that could mute net subscriber additions in the short run. -- Brent Bracelin  -- Alyssa Johnson  -- Trevor Upton  -- Monika Garg  -- Jason Celino  -- Josh Beck  -- Ankit Kapoor To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

1,"Stocks have taken a beating recently, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 all falling by more than 8% in the past month. Yet as global worries rock markets, U.S. small-caps look attractive, says Thomas Vandeventer. Given that small company revenues are largely domestic, the strong U.S. dollar poses less of a problem than it does for big multinationals, and small stock performance is less correlated to global gross domestic product growth, which has been lackluster. Vandeventer manages the Tocqueville Opportunity fund (ticker:        TOPPX),      which focuses on small- and mid-cap stocks but has the flexibility to hold onto larger names. He says he likes this area of the market for the “plethora of investment opportunity” and the fact that small- and mid-cap stocks have higher returns than large-cap equities over rolling five- and 10-year periods. Academic research, most famously by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, supports the case for a “small-cap premium,” although capturing it is easier said than done.His fund has not only consistently outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide measure – another win for small-caps – but also handily outperformed its Morningstar category, the S&P MidCap 400, and the Russell 2000 over the past three-, five- and 15-year periods, and is No. 1 in its category over the past year. Vandeventer is a big fan of the health-care sector, but he’s selective. For example, since the fortunes of many small pharmaceutical and biotech companies hinge on a single drug, most of Vandeventer’s holdings are further along in their trials and have often seen big investments by larger pharma players. His picks are attractive enough that in a little more than five years, some 65 stocks in his portfolio have been bought out. Read excerpts from his Barrons.com interview below. Barrons.com: Health care is your top sector and you own Bluebird Bio (            BLUE),      Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (            ALNY      ) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (            REGN      ) in your top 10.   Vandeventer: Regeneron has turned into a large-cap name, but our first investments in Regeneron were probably down around a $100. It is a name that continued to execute — a significant driver of their revenues of course has been a macular degeneration drug, Eylea, and much of its competition is out of business because of quality issues. It also has this new drug, which is a PCSK9 inhibitor, a nonmanaged cholesterol LDL injectable solution. And Amgen (            AMGN      ) and Regeneron both have products that are going to be hitting the market. Bluebird is in targeted medicine, in which a virus is used to deliver a drug. When we look back decades from now, we will say this is the most significant investment opportunity in the health-care revolution. Gene editing, gene altering, gene amplification, gene silencing, etc. are enabled by the science behind the human genome, which was a work in progress 15 years ago. People ask me, “What’s the right number of health-care companies to own?” I always say, “How many diseases are there in the body” It’s a very different period from the 1990s when you could go out and buy Merck (            MRK      ) and Johnson & Johnson (            JNJ      ) and cover your health-care investment. We’ve held Bluebird since the IPO, and it has some very promising drugs in a very rare disease, and then it has these other drugs in beta thalassemia and sickle cell. With sickle cell it’s doing a therapy and having a cure with one administration of its drug. The sample sizes aren’t big yet, but the results are incredibly powerful.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals uses RNA interference, so basically attacking a disease at the RNA level and it has a PCSK9 it’s working on. It has a hepatitis medicine it’s working on, and it has a number of liver disease-oriented drugs. It’s been a long-term investment of the fund, and I continue to believe that it has the leading platforms, leading pipelines, and leading financial position because of a strong balance sheet in what I would call RNA-mediated therapies.(as of Aug. 18, 2015) Source: Morningstar  Q: Tech is your second-largest sector weighting.  A: I’ve been moving money into so-called big data, the cloud etc. Whether it is real-time processing, analytics, security or human capital management, this is an area that is ripe for productivity enhancement and the business model has changed so that there’s a cost benefit to letting somebody else do it for you, on a subscription basis. Cloud-based solutions are delivered more like a utility. We had an incredible opportunity last year in the spring selloff, a lot of these names went down 30%-40% because someone blew the whistle on valuation and people were kind of throwing these names away. Palo Alto Networks (            PANW      ) was at $60 a share and now it is at $165. We will always see intermittent periods of volatility, but they generally continue to build market share and the revenue growth is very rapid. Paycom Software (            PAYC      ) falls into the HR arena. Paycom just reported a spectacular quarter, gross margin of 83.5% up from 81% a year ago. It concentrates on companies with anywhere from 50 to 2,000 employees, and recently it had some acceleration in getting into larger companies, up to 5,000 employees. It is growing revenues in excess of 40%. It has a new application focused on helping companies process all the data they need to conform to the Affordable Care Act. This is the kind of company that ends up in someone else’s bull’s-eye. Q: Let’s talk about some of your financial holdings.  A: Signature Bank (            SBNY      ) and Pinnacle Financial (            PNFP      ) are two sides of the same coin. These are banks that expand their assets not just through loan growth, but also by acquiring loan portfolios. Signature is in New York City and Pinnacle is based in Nashville, Tennessee, and the two business models look very similar; the major difference is that Signature is a bank where there is a personal responsibility by the employees for the profitability of the bank, and Pinnacle is all for one and one for all — employees’ compensation schemes are based on the whole bank, where Signature’s compensation schemes are kind of based on how the individual teams do. (as of June 30, 2015) Source: Morningstar Then the most interesting investment I have in financials right now is BofI Holding (          BOFI      ). It just reported stellar earnings: Earnings per share were up 32% year over year, and with spectacular loan growth. This is a branchless bank and its efficiency ratio is 33%: Its loan origination costs are at least 40% lower than the average bank, so its offices are five to 10 times more productive and it has a huge cost advantage. It has incredible credit quality. It had no charge-offs last quarter, and nonperforming assets actually dropped to 0.55%, about a third versus the prior quarter. Here’s a bank that’s growing earnings by more than 30% per year; it sells at about 18 times earnings.  Q: It’s larger than most holdings, but Tesla Motors (            TSLA      ) is one of the newer additions to your portfolio.  A: Tesla has a leading position in electrical vehicles (EV) and battery technologies. The big question with this company in terms of the driving technologies is how many models can they get on the road, and what is their production capacity, etc. They’ve had some hiccups, but they are still the leading company and with the most visionary management. Tesla is innovating from a manufacturing and production standpoint to be the go-to supplier of batteries for EV vehicles and for storage. Without a doubt it is the leading automobile tech play right now, and potentially the most disruptive. The internal combustion engine survives, but the model for the future is being developed today, and Tesla is at the head of the pack.  Q: Thanks.

0," Pacific Crest Securities For 2015, we prefer enterprise-software stocks that offer growth with profitability, particularly as the software-as-a-service group moves further along in its lifecycle.Expectations appear reasonable for the fourth quarter. Implied guidance around customer growth and pricing will likely have a large impact on Outperform-rated HubSpot (ticker:            HUBS      ) and Zendesk (            ZEN      ). Exchange rates are likely to have some impact on Cornerstone OnDemand (            CSOD      ) also rated Outperform and Zendesk. However, we remain focused on constant-currency growth rates and trends in the underlying businesses, which are still very strong.We are buyers of Cornerstone, HubSpot, Paycom Software (            PAYC      ) and Zendesk all rated at Outperform ahead of results.After a controversial 2014, many investors are expecting Cornerstone to have a weak 2015. In our view, Cornerstone has reset expectations to a level where it can exceed guidance. Cornerstone is likely to grow net users by over 20% in 2015, and revenue per user by 5% to 10%. Additionally, Cornerstone has a large upsell opportunity within its existing customer installed base. Exchange rates have worsened for Cornerstone, which could result in a slightly lower 2015 outlook, which remains a risk. However, valuation remains the most compelling reason to own Cornerstone, in our view. Cornerstone trades at a substantial discount to its high-growth peers, and while we do see some risk to management’s long-run growth target of 30%, we continue to see Cornerstone as a great value; we see upside to $37.HubSpot has some of the strongest retention rates in the small- and medium-sized business (SMB) marketing automation industry. This, combined with the opportunity to upsell customers to higher levels of service, is a major tailwind to the lifetime value of its customers. We expect HubSpot to have 720 net customer additions in the fourth quarter, ending the quarter with 13,200. This would represent 31% year-over-year customer growth. Additionally, we expect average selling prices (ASPs) to see a tailwind of approximately 9% year-over-year. HubSpot continues to have success moving customers to higher-level subscription plans. In 2015, we expect another year of ASP growth.With both strong revenue growth and operating margins, Paycom remains one of our top picks for 2015. We will be closely monitoring new annualized recurring revenue (ANRR) in the quarter, as well as any commentary around new offices. Sales productivity is also likely to be a closely monitored topic as Paycom has opened several new offices in the past 12 months. As the new sales teams become fully productive, we expect incremental upside to total new ANRR per office. Paycom has no international exposure or exchange-rate risk.Zendesk appears poised to deliver outsized growth in 2015. While Zendesk may face some headwinds from slowing international markets, we continue to focus on the underlying health of the business. Currently, Zendesk prices the vast majority of its products in dollars. We expect customer account growth to be in excess of 30% in 2015. Additionally, we expect a lift in ASPs from going up-market into the enterprise. We will be closely monitoring hiring activity in the fourth quarter. The company is rapidly expanding and was slightly behind internal plans in the third quarter. Much of the company’s outsized growth over the past several years has come from organic leads. In 2015, Zendesk plans to grow its outbound sales team materially. In our view, an outbound sales team could accelerate billings growth and potentially allow the company to take market share. -- Brendan Barnicle  -- Owen Hyde To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

1,"Square      stock is a rare bright spot in an otherwise largely dour equity market. The financial-technology companyannounced fourth-quarter results on Wednesday after the market closed that were above Wall Street’s forecasts, and the stock is rising in Thursday trading. Square stock (ticker: SQ) is up 10%, at $84.24, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      is down 1.9%. Over the past 12 months, Square is up 3%, compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 10%.The company said it earned a better-than-expected adjusted 23 cents per share in the fourth quarter on $1.31 billion in revenue. Total payments volume—a closely watched metric in the sector—came in at $28.6 billion. Analysts had expected the company to deliver $28.1 billion in total payments volume, according to FactSet. The results were enough for Canaccord Genuity to upgrade Square stock from a Buy to a Hold. Square’s Cash app is “on a tear,” Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi said in a note to clients. Square’s peer-to-peer payments and money-transfer app had approximately 24 million monthly active users in December, the company said, and revenue increased 147% year over year to $361 million. In December 2018, the Cash app had 15 million monthly active users. The app competes with            PayPal Holdings      ’ (PYPL) Venmo.Many bulls have focused their positive view on the stock around the company’s ability to monetize its user base going forward. Square’s ability to boost revenue from the app in the most recent quarter provides evidence to support that thesis. Corrections & Amplifications Square brought in $361 million in revenue through its Cash app in the fourth quarter. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the figure was $361 billion.

0," Green Dot shares are surging after news that an activist shareholder took a stake in the payments company prompted analysts to take a more upbeat view.Green Dot      stock (ticker: GDOT) was up 6.7% in Tuesday trading to about $33.75 a share after activist investor Starboard Value said in securities filings it had built up just over a 9% position in the provider of pre-paid debit cards. Green Dot stock is down 55% over the last 12 months, compared to a 21% rise in the        S&P 500.      Starboard is a well-known activist investor with a reputation for shaking up management teams and pressuring executives to shift strategic direction. News that Starboard bought in caused Citigroup analyst Andrew Schmidt to upgrade the stock from Sell to Neutral and raise his price target from $22 to $34. Deutsche Bank’s Ashish Sabadra raised his target from $30 to $35, but kept the stock at Hold.As Green Dot’s stock price indicates, the company has had a rough time recently. In December, Green Dot announced that its founder and CEO Steve Streit would step down. The company slashed its full-year financial forecasts when it released earnings for both of the past two quarters, spooking Wall Street and causing the stock to dive. Green Dot’s core business of serving unbanked and underbanked customers with prepaid debit cards has been under significant pressure from services such as            PayPal Holdings      ’ (ticker: PYPL) Venmo and            Square’s      (SQ) Cash app. It’s easy to think of those payment and peer-to-peer money transfer apps as primarily aimed at millennials, but both Venmo and the Cash app have a core user base of lower-income consumers who have less access to traditional financial services. Venmo and Cash offer debit cards linked to users’ app accounts, and also let users transfer money, receive payments, and cash checks. Green Dot lets customers do these things too, with its mobile-banking product, but it hasn’t been able to attract as many customers as have Venmo and the Cash app. They have about 40 million and 7 million users, respectively.How exactly Starboard will turn around Green Dot’s business is unclear, but for now, Schmidt thinks that investors’ expectations that they will do something outweigh the negatives and are likely to support the stock.

0,"Three months after            Envestnet’s      founder was killed in a car crash, the fintech software provider is facing questions about its future. Envestnet (Ticker: ENV), which provides financial- and wealth-management software to financial advisors, may be on the brink of going private, bankers said. Large private-equity firms, in particular, are said to be interested. The most likely buyers include            Blackstone       (BX),            KKR       (KKR), Hellman & Friedman, Silver Lake and            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS).            BlackRock       (BLK), which acquired 5% of Envestnet in 2018, could also be in play. “Everyone wants Envestnet but it’s very expensive,” one banker said. Based in Chicago, Envestnet has a near-$4 billion market cap. The company’s shares were up 0.1% to $74.54 Thursday afternoon. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was down 0.3%. “As a matter of corporate policy, we do not comment on rumor or speculation in the market,” an Envestnet spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions. Silver Lake and Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. Representatives for Blackstone, KKR, Fidelity and BlackRock couldn’t be reached for comment. Rumors of an Envestnet sale began surfacing after Jud Bergman, the company’s founder and CEO, died in a car crash in October, Barron’s reported. Envestnet named Bill Crager, co-founder and president, as its interim CEO. Crager is credited with doing a good job since assuming leadership of Envestnet. Envestnet has its roots in venture capital. Founded in 1999, the fintech collected $40 million in six rounds of funding from investors, including TCV, BlackRock and UpFront Ventures, according to business-information provider Crunchbase. It went public in 2010, raising $63 million in its initial public offering, according to PitchBook, a financial data and software company. Envestnet doesn’t seem like a company that would seek a buyout. Its stock has jumped nearly 24% since Oct. 4, when Envestnet announced Bergman’s death, it isn’t overly leveraged and it doesn’t need a turnaround. Peter Heckmann, a managing director and senior research analyst at DA Davidson, said Envestnet’s stock is valued at 17 to 18 times Ebitda, while its debt is moderate. Envestnet’s debt is about $600 million or 2.5 times debt-to-ebitda, which is expected to fall to 2.2 times by the end of year. “For these types of companies, investors are comfortable with debt getting up to three times,” Heckmann said. If it doesn’t sell, Envestnet might seek to sell a chunk of itself. The most probable candidate is Yodlee, which it acquired in 2015 for more than $600 million. Yodlee, based in Redwood City, Calif. is a data aggregator, much different from Envestnet’s core function as an outsourcer to financial advisors. More than 1,200 companies use Yodlee, including 15 of the top 20 large U.S. banks. A Yodlee sale became more likely this month when Visa agreed to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion, or nearly 50 times run-rate revenue. The two companies are somewhat similar. While Yodlee provides technology that helps consumers aggregate their credit-card statements, bank accounts and investment portfolios on one site, Plaid’s technology lets consumers connect their bank accounts to finance apps and transfer money. “Yodlee is kind of like Plaid but not really,” a second banker said. Envestnet is considering selling Yodlee in an attempt to secure Plaid’s “halo” effect, the second banker said.Yodlee, however, ran into trouble this month when three members of Congress claimed that the fintech might be selling personal data without proper consent, The Wall Street Journal reported. Banks and fintech apps use Yodlee to collect and analyze transaction data from a consumers’ bank, credit card and other financial accounts, Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) and Rep. Anna Eshoo (D., Calif.) said in a Jan. 17 letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Envestnet doesn’t tell consumers that it is collecting and selling a customer’s personal financial data. Instead, the company relies on its partners, many times the banks, to disclose this information in their terms and conditions or privacy policy, the letter said. The lawmakers called on the FTC to investigate whether Envestnet’s sale of personal data violates the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Journal said. Heckmann thinks the ruckus over Yodlee will “blow over.” Consumers must agree to let Yodlee use their data, he said. Plaid also has the same regulatory issue as Yodlee. “Not only did Visa get comfortable with Plaid but they were willing to pay a huge premium,” Heckmann said. How much could Yodlee sell for? The company is expected to generate about $200 million in 2019 revenue, which is seen rising to $218 million in 2020, Heckmann said. Strong fintechs are selling for 15 to 20 times revenue. Given Plaid’s high valuation, Yodlee may fetch $2 billion. Possible buyers include            Mastercard       (MA),            PayPal       (PYPL) and Ant Financial, a subsidiary of            Alibaba      (BABA). Still, Envestnet could opt out of either strategy and remain a public company. “They have a good plan, they’re executing on that plan and they have a good valuation in the market,” Heckmann said. A PayPal spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Mastercard and Ant couldn’t be reached for comment. A spokesman for Envestnet Yodlee said the company doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation.

1,"PayPal       shares are losing ground late Wednesday after the online payments company posted slightly weaker-than-expected guidance for both the first quarter and the full year 2020.For the fourth quarter, PayPal (ticker: PYPL) reported revenue of $4.96 billion, with adjusted profits of 86 cents a share, ahead of the Street consensus of $4.94 billion and 83 cents. Results were in line with the company’s previous guidance, which called for revenue of $4.89 billion to $4.95 billion, and profits of 81 to 83 cents a share.But forward guidance disappointed the Street. For the first quarter, the company sees revenue of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion and adjusted profits of 76 to 78 cents a share, falling short of the Wall Street analyst consensus forecast of $4.85 billion and 82 cents.For all of 2020, PayPal projects revenue of $20.8 billion to $21 billion, with adjusted profits of $3.39 to $3.46 a share; Street consensus had been $20.79 billion and $3.49 a share.PayPal says projected adjusted profits reflect acquisition related costs of 2-3 cents a share for the first quarter and 8-10 cents a share for the full year, which might reflect the full-year estimate miss.“PayPal delivered strong results in 2019, achieving many records including revenue, net income and operating margin performance,” CEO Dan Schulman said in a statement. “We added 37.3 million net new active accounts, bringing total active accounts to 305 million, up 14% year over year. In Q4 alone, we processed nearly $200 billion of total payment value and engagement grew 10% to 40.6 transactions per active account.”In late trading, PayPal is off about 2.5%, to $113.70.

All Rights ReservedMastercard      became the tenth-largest U.S. company by market value on Friday, passing ahead of            Walmart.      The credit card and payments giant’s stock has returned almost 45% annually over the past three years, versus 15% for the        S&P 500.      Strong and consistent earnings growth have kept Mastercard shares rising and at a premium valuation multiple to the market. Analysts expect to see another strong quarter from Mastercard (ticker: MA) when it reports its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday morning. Here is a snapshot of Wall Street’s expectations and some recent history:• Changing technologies and preferences along with booming e-commerce sales have made the use of credit and debits cards more ingrained and habitual for consumers across the globe. Every time a card with Mastercard’s orange and red logo on it is used, the company earns a percentage of the transaction—known as “swipe fees”—paid by the merchant and often passed along to the buyer. • A virtual duopoly exists in the card processing business: Mastercard and            Visa       (V) both benefit competitively from their greater scale than smaller rivals and make the industry exceedingly difficult to disrupt. The more merchants, banks, and users on each network, the deeper Visa’s and Mastercard’s competitive moat.• Tech giants            Apple       (AAPL),            Alphabet       (GOOGL),            Amazon.com      (AMZN), and            Facebook       (FB) have each approached the payments industry but haven’t made a meaningful dent.            PayPal       (PYPL) is the lone tech company to succeed on Visa and Mastercard turf. Court challenges alleging that Visa and Mastercard have abused their market dominance have failed.• Wall Street analysts expect Mastercard to report $1.87 in adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter, up 21% from $1.55 in the same quarter last year. Revenue is estimated at $4.4 billion, versus $3.8 billion a year earlier. Mastercard’s purchase volume is a closely watched metric. The consensus forecast is that it rose 13% year over year, to $1.3 trillion last quarter.• Mastercard reported its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29, posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.15 on $4.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had been expecting EPS of $2.01 and $4.4 billion in revenue. Purchase volume came in at $1.2 trillion, about equal to Wall Street estimates and up 12.5%. Mastercard stock fell 0.6% that day.• Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock: 92% have a Buy or equivalent rating, while 6% recommend a Hold.

The potential for a deal between the two companies was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Plaid, which has raised more than $310 million since it was founded in 2012, according to Crunchbase, and was most recently valued at $2.65 billion in the private market, helps consumers give a plethora of financial apps access to their bank account information. Visa, along with rival card company            Mastercard       (MA), were both investors in Plaid.Plaid is behind the process that            PayPal’s      Venmo uses to link users’ accounts to their bank accounts. When someone types in his or her bank’s username and password into Venmo, Plaid verifies and links the account instantly. In the longer-term, the deal may help Visa emerge as a competitor to the money transfer and peer-to-peer payment platforms that currently use Plaid. “This acquisition helps Visa to strengthen its relationships with financial institutions by connecting their customers with fintechs. We do not see this as competitive and Visa is not intending to use this acquisition to compete with Venmo,” a spokesperson from PayPal said.PayPal stock has ticked up 0.1% to $115.40 in premarket trading.

0,"Alphabet’s e-commerce platform business is underestimated by the stock market, according to Baird. The company’s shares (ticker: GOOGL) have risen about 30% this year. In October, it reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter profits, but in recent weeks investors overlooked the shortfall because it was driven by Alphabet’s equity investments and not operating businesses. On Thursday, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reaffirmed his Outperform rating for            Alphabet      stock.Google is “the other e-commerce powerhouse,” he wrote. “Already influencing roughly one-third of e-commerce volumes, Google Shopping should become an even more important growth driver for Alphabet as an alternative to 3P third party marketplaces.”The two main other third-party marketplaces are on            Amazon      (AMZN) and            eBay      (EBAY), where external sellers place their products on those websites.Alphabet shares were up 0.3% to $1,355.87 on Thursday. Sebastian reiterated his Alphabet price target of $1,400.The analyst is also optimistic about the new president of Google Commerce, Bill Ready, who came from            PayPal.      He expects more merchants to add their product catalogs onto Google’s platform due to the company’s attractive customer acquisition capabilities. Other Wall Street analysts are bullish on Alphabet, with 87% having a Buy or Overweight rating on the company, according to FactSet.

All Rights ReservedFintech stocks are near record highs as the winners of digital-payments revolution continue to churn out profits. But for the financial companies that have missed out on the boom, things are looking rough. One of those companies is prepaid debit-card provider            Green Dot      (ticker: GDOT), whose founder and CEO, along with its CFO, announced late Wednesday that they will step down.Green Dot stock dropped 13.6% to $22.34 Thursday morning as the        S&P 500      rose 0.2%. And things look even worse over the longer-term. The stock is down more than 70% this year, compared with the S&P 500’s 27% gain. The company said that founder and Chief Executive Steve Streit will become an independent advisor to the company with the title of chief innovation officer effective Dec. 31. He will also step down from the company’s board. Current CFO Mark Shifke will also leave the company then.Green Dot Chairman William Jacobs will be interim CEO and the company’s operational CFO and chief accounting officer, Jess Unruh, will be interim CFO. Green Dot shares plunged after each of its last two quarterly earnings announcements. In both cases, the company spooked Wall Street by slashing its full-year guidance. Additionally, the company said in August that its number of total active users fell to 5.66 million from 6.05 million.Green Dot’s core business of prepaid debit cards has been under significant pressure from services such as            PayPal’s      (PYPL) Venmo and            Square’s      (SQ) Cash app. While many people think of those services as aimed at millennials, each has a core user base of unbanked and underbanked consumers—exactly the target customer of Green Dot’s prepaid cards. Not only do Venmo and Cash offer cards linked to users’ app account, they provide the ability to transfer money to other users and bank accounts, and receive payments and cash checks. Green Dot offers these features, too, with its mobile-banking product, but it simply hasn’t been able to attract as many customers as have Venmo and the Cash app, which have about 40 million and 7 million users, respectively.

0,"Payments stocks, which have broadly been on a historically excellent run, can stay hot in 2020, thanks to strong trends like the continued shift to card payments and M&A synergies, Wedbush’s Moise Katri said. Katri, in a Dec. 12 note to clients, highlighted            Fidelity National Information Services      (ticker: FIS) and            PayPal Holdings       (PYPL) as his top picks, while also continuing to rate perennial profit-machines            Mastercard      (MA) and            Visa      (V) at outperform. FIS stock is up 36% so far this year, while PayPal has gained 26%. Mastercard shares have risen 57% and Visa is up 40%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 27% in 2019. “Despite a potential global economic slowdown, and uncertainty associated with an upcoming U.S. election (regulatory risk),” Katri wrote these stocks will continue to benefit from broad trends like “the disintermediation of cash/checks by electronic payments, the proliferation of mobile payments,” and the cost-savings from M&A activity. The latter trend is why Katri is bullish on FIS. FIS acquired Worldpay in March for $34 billion, the largest-ever deal in the international payments space. The deal was part of a flurry of M&A activity in the payments space. Total Systems Services (TSS), also known as TSYS, announced a $21.5 billion merger with Global Payments in May, and            Fiserv      (FISV) in January agreed to buy First Data for $22 billion.Katri thinks that the newly combined FIS/Worldpay is “well positioned for explosive 3-5 year growth.” He thinks Wall Street continues to model the benefits of the transaction, from cost-savings to cross-selling opportunities to fraud rate reductions, “too conservatively.”PayPal, meanwhile, is primed to outperform, Katri said, because it will benefit from the trend of blurring lines “between traditional banks, payments vendors as well as companies providing social/mobile eco-systems.”Mastercard and Visa have been huge beneficiaries of the global shift to credit and debit card payments from cash and checks, and Katri doesn’t see that trend, or those two payments behemoths ability to profit from it, slowing in 2020.

1,"Fintech—the nexus of finance and technology—is undeniably a huge investment opportunity. But a major factor in whether investors are successful is how they define fintech. After all, there’s a big difference in between a fintech investment strategy that bought shares of credit card and digital payments companies            Mastercard      (ticker: MA),            PayPal      (PYPL),            Square      (SQ) and            Visa      (V), and one that invested in pure-play fintech lenders            Elevate Credit      (ELVT),            LendingClub      (LC), and            On Deck Capital      (ONDK). With the former portfolio, you’d be hard-pressed to find a way not to reap triple digit-returns over the past few years. With the latter, it’d take extraordinary market timing just to stay out of the red.But fintech isn’t a type of company or even a subset of finance, KBW’s Hari Sivakumaran wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Instead, “it refers to a company’s state of technological innovation and can be measured quantitatively and qualitatively as business models adapt to technologically-based products, services, and operational infrastructure,” he wrote. He used that definition to look at more than 650 financial stocks in Europe and the U.S. and highlighted stocks of companies that are well-positioned to take advantage of key industry and consumer trends. In the U.S., Sivakumaran highlights real estate as one of the industries “on the cusp of a digital sea change.” Venture capital investments in real estate technology through the first nine months of 2019 hit $13.8 billion, up from $7.9 billion over the same period last year. This is “forcing real estate incumbents to re-examine their digital strategies and recognize that technology is no longer just a back-office function used to keep the lights on,” he wrote. “Rather, it presents an opportunity to revolutionize antiquated processes and improve client results, potentially augmenting expected returns for real estate overall.” In the so-called proptech space, KBW has Outperform ratings on            CoStar Group      (CSGP), a real-estate data and analytics company, and            RealPage      (RP), a property management software company.Another area highlighted by Sivakumaran is the continued digitization of fixed-income trading. To give a sense of just how big an opportunity this is, he pointed out that just about a quarter of the total notional volume in the high-grade corporate bond market was executed electronically last year. In the high-yield bond market, that number was just 10%. He highlights            MarketAxess Holdings      (MKTX) and            Tradeweb Markets      (TW) as two companies will benefit from the push toward e-trading in the bond market.

1,"The recent market decline due to uncertainty over the coronavirus is providing attractive buying opportunities in the semiconductor sector, according to Wells Fargo Securities. Chip stocks have tumbled, along with equity markets. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (ticker: SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, has declined by about 14% over the past month, compared with the 16% drop for the        S&P 500.      Wells Fargo analyst Gary Mobley on Monday reiterated his Overweight ratings for both            Qorvo      (QRVO) and            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS). He noted both chip makers already modestly lowered their financial forecasts due to the coronavirus last week. “Following a recent round of estimate cuts for QRVO & SWKS...we believe next 12 months estimates have been largely de-risked,” he wrote. “We suggest investors buy shares of QRVO & SWKS following the recent sell off.”Qorvo shares were down 4.5% to $90.09, while Skyworks stock declined 6.7% to $89.27 on Monday afternoon. The chip companies make radio-frequency, or RF, semiconductors, which enable smartphones to communicate with wireless networks.The analyst said the two companies are the “best-in-class” ways to play the growth in 5G smartphones as the amount of RF chip content is much higher in 5G phones than in the prior 4G models. He also thinks China may subsidize the cost of 5G handsets to boost demand and help its economy. “We believe wider adoption of 5G...will drive the smartphone industry to transition to more global designs (which uses more expensive RF...solutions),” he wrote.Wall Street analysts are mixed on Qorvo. About 54% have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 46% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet. Views about Skyworks are similar, with 55% at Buy and 42% at Hold.

0,"Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) is the latest tech company to lower its outlook because of coronavirus’ impact on both global supply chains and demand in China. But, for now, the market seems to be looking past the current quarter issues, focusing instead on the longer-term picture.On Wednesday Skyworks (ticker: SWKS), which makes chips used by            Apple      (AAPL) and other mobile phone companies, said it now sees revenue of $760 million to $770 million for its fiscal second quarter ending March 27, down from a previous forecast of $800 million to $820 million. The company trimmed its non-GAAP profit outlook to $1.34 a share at the midpoint of the revenue range, from $1.46. “Although COVID-19 has caused no significant disruption within Skyworks’ manufacturing operations to date, the current demand environment for our products has been negatively impacted by interruptions in global supply chains,” Skyworks COE Liam Griffin said in a statement.Skywork’s revised forecast isn’t a huge surprise, given other recent warnings about Coronavirus’ impact. Apple recently said that it wouldn’t hit its previous March quarter revenue guidance of $63 billion to $67 billion, due to virus-related supply chain and demand issues in China, and there were similar warnings earlier this week from Skyworks’ rival            Qorvo      (QRVO).Here’s a quick look at the growing list of tech companies that have issued warnings for the current quarter:While most of these stocks sold off in recent weeks as the market tumbled on coronavirus fears, the specific announcements had little immediate impact on the stocks—shares of Skyworks are up 3.3% on Wednesday, to $102.88, outpacing the        S&P 500’s      2.7% gain, as of 1:45 p.m. ET. Investors continue to expect supply chain and sales disruptions caused by the coronavirus to be transitory—and that sales lost in the March quarter will mostly be made up in subsequent quarters. In short, the view is that we’re seeing orders delayed, not canceled.  Write to Eric J.

1,"Stocks tumbled Tuesday amid continuous fears over the spreading coronavirus outside of China, with a rate cut offering little to no support.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      dropped 785.91 points, or 2.94%, to close at 25,917.41. The        S&P 500      lost 86.86 points, or 2.81%, to end at 3003.37, and the        Nasdaq Composite      tumbled 268.08 points, or 2.99%, to close at 8684.09.Responding to Covid-19’s perceived economic impact, the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by half point to a range between 1.00% and 1.25% on Tuesday morning. At the following press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is in active contact with other central banks and there might be more formal coordination moving forward.This is the first rate cut outside a scheduled meeting since October 2008, and the vote was unanimous. After a brief respite, all three major stock indexes closed in the red as investors doubt that the central bank can really curb the coronavirus’ damage by loosening monetary policy. Some on Wall Street think the cut indicated that the Fed sees a credible danger of a possible credit crisis for small and midsized businesses–and consequently, a recession.Following the rate cut, gold futures jumped more than 3% and U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply to record lows as investors moved out of stocks and into haven assets. The two-year Treasury yields dropped 10.1 basis points to settle at 0.723%, 10-year yields slipped 8 basis points to 1.005%, and 30-year bond yields slid 2.2 basis points to 1.622%. The 10-year yields even briefly dropped below 1% for the first time ever. Companies continued to cut guidance, citing coronavirus impact. Following rivalMastercard      (MA), credit-card giant            Visa      (V) cut its forecast for net revenue growth in the March-ended quarter by 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points from the initial projection, citing a sharp slowdown in its cross-border business, in particular, travel-related spending. The company said it does not believe this deteriorating trend has bottomed out yet. Chip makers            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) also joined other tech companies to cut revenue guidance.Investors are also nervously watching the results from Democratic primary ballots in 14 states and one U.S. territory. Super Tuesday has typically been a strong indicator of the likely eventual nominee for the presidential election in November.

But analysts so far are relieved the negative sales impact on forecasts isn’t larger.On Tuesday,            Qorvo      (ticker: QRVO) lowered its March-quarter sales guidance by $50 million from the midpoint of its prior range to $770 million. After the release, Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman reaffirmed his Outperform rating for the chip maker. “Given our view of the broad impact to production in MarQ, the company’s revenue outlook for MarQ is much better than we thought,” he wrote. “Qorvo represents a unique, underappreciated paly on higher RFFE RF front-end content in 5G handsets.”Ackerman believes the company will capture more chip-market share from the top six smartphone makers in the world.Qorvo makes radio-frequency, or RF, semiconductors, which enable smartphones to communicate with wireless networks. The company’s stock was down 1.7%, at $98.77, in recent trading. The        S&P 500      was down 1.9%.One major chip-equipment maker also said the negative impact thus far from the outbreak on demand wasn’t significant. “We’re looking at this every day,” Doug Bettinger, the chief financial officer of            Lam Research      (LRCX), said during a visit to Barron’s Tuesday. “We have not seen any change in customer demand as a result of this. Customer demand is still very strong.”To be sure, business trends and outlooks can always deteriorate further if infections accelerate around the world. But so far, at least, it seems chip stock analysts aren’t overly worried yet.

1,"Multiple chip stocks are heading lower Tuesday in the wake of            Apple’s      announcement that its March-quarter revenue will fall short of previous guidance due to the impact of the spreading coronavirus crisis on both contract manufacturing and retail sales in China.Apple (ticker: AAPL) had previously forecast March-quarter revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion but now says it won’t reach that level, and Wall Street estimates are dropping to the $60 billion level or lower. Barclays      analyst Blayne Curtis published a list of component makers Tuesday morning by their revenue exposure to Apple—and most of the names on the list are heading lower. Note, though, that the losses are modest, a reflection of the relatively muted reaction to the announcement on Apple shares. Analysts are cutting their estimates on Apple’s March-quarter results but lifting projections for the June quarter. The widespread view is that the long-term impact on Apple’s business will be minimal.On the other hand, for companies who makes parts for mobile phones, exposure goes beyond Apple and includes both China-based phone makers like Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi and other Android handset makers who rely on Chinese contract manufacturers.Here’s the Barclays list of chip stocks ranked by estimated revenue exposure to Apple:Curtis also ranks chip companies by exposure to Huawei, the leading Chinese mobile-phone manufacturer, and by exposure to non-Huawei Android phone makers like            Samsung Electronics      (005930.Korea):Huawei exposure:Non-Huawei Android phone exposure:In early trading Tuesday, shares of Apple, Micron, Cirrus, Qorvo, Lumentum, and Skyworks were all off more than 2%. The        S&P 500      was down 0.2%. Write to Eric J.

1,"The stock market’s reaction to Coronavirus has been mixed, with some companies that rely on China for customers or supplies falling by double-digits while others have barely shrugged.The virus is likely to reduce economic growth in the first quarter by 2 percentage points globally and 0.4-0.5 points in the U.S., according to            Goldman Sachs      strategists. But Goldman predicts that nearly all of that economic activity will be made up in the second and third quarters, so that there’s barely any net economic impact from the disease. For the full year, U.S. GDP could take a 0.1 to 0.2 point hit, reducing cumulative corporate earnings per share for        S&P 500       companies by 30 to 60 cents. Given that Goldman expects S&P earnings to hit $174 this year, 60 cents is basically chump change.So far, the virus has mostly been contained in China, with nearly 99% of the known cases being recorded there. There’s no guarantee that it won’t begin to spread more aggressively outside the country. For now, investors have mostly treated it like an isolated issue. In China, the death toll hit 910 on Monday morning, surpassing the SARS epidemic. But some analysts see signs that the economy could begin to rebound in February. In fact, some factories that had been shut down could get back to work this week, according to analyst Edward Moya at currency broker OANDA.“Foxconn got approval to resume production in Zhengzhou, the main production point for iPhone 11, with most of the other manufacturing giants all to be poised to back to work within the next couple of weeks,” Moya wrote in a report on Monday. “GM will resume Chinese production on February 15th,            Hyundai Motor      will resume their domestic production tomorrow, both            Sony       &             LG Display       resumed normal operations today, while            Tencent       asked workers to stay at home until February 21st.”That said, businesses had previously predicted they’d restart operations after the Lunar New Year only to be delayed, so these dates could always be pushed back.The Goldman strategists have identified stocks with outsize exposure to China that have fallen the most since investors started to worry about the outbreak. They include            Wynn Resorts      (ticker: WYNN), which makes most of its money in Macau, a gambling resort area in China.            Yum China      (YUMC), which operates KFC and Pizza Hut inside China, has also been hurt. And computer chip maker            Qorvo      (QRVO) makes nearly three quarters of its revenue in China.Other consumer stocks focused on growing sales in China have also been hurt. Both            Royal Caribbean      (RCL) and            Carnival       (CCL) cruise companies are down about 10% since late January.            Starbucks      (SBUX) has closed more than half of its stores in China. Airlines including            Delta       (DAL),            United Airlines      (UAL) and            American Airlines      (AAL) have canceled flights to and from the country. Of those, United has the most exposure to China. Its stock is down 10% this year.Still, the strategists don’t think investors should buy every stock that’s fallen in the hope that the virus will be contained. People should look in particular at cyclical and value stocks, they say. Companies that are growing their dividends have been trailing the market and could rebound on expectations that virus-related declines could reverse. Stocks with growing dividends that are likely to swing on market shifts include            Skyworks       (SWKS),            DXC Technology       (DXC),            Wynn Resorts       (WYNN),            Broadcom      (AVGO), and            Caterpillar      (CAT).

1,"U.S. stocks are set to open flat on Monday as investors digest the ongoing threat of the coronavirus. All the benchmark indexes closed at records last week before slipping on Friday as optimism over the virus subsided. Stock futures have fluctuated on Monday as investors work out what to make of the latest developments. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was set to open slightly lower as futures dipped, along with the        S&P 500      and the        Nasdaq.      Chinese officials reported 97 deaths on Sunday, a new daily record, diminishing hopes that the outbreak was stabilizing. However, a scientific model predicted the number of cases would peak in mid-to-late February.Companies, economists, analysts and investors have been trying to count the cost of the full impact of the virus as it continues to spread.Goldman Sachs analysts said the economic impact will be limited and investors should look to cyclical and value stocks. Goldman analysts said the virus would hit U.S. economic growth by up to 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter, but the drag would be recouped over the next two quarters and the global damage could be as low as 0.1 percentage points over the full year. “The impact of the lower global and U.S. economic activity on 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share will be limited,” Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David Kostin, said in a note.“Investors who believe the economic consequences of the coronavirus will be limited should increase exposure to cyclicals and value stocks,” they said.The bank’s sector-neutral dividend growth basket of 50 stocks has “declined sharply” alongside cyclicals and trades with depressed valuations.“If fears of global pandemic are allayed, the basket should outperform,” they added.The basket’s stocks set to outperform the most are semiconductor company            Skyworks,      IT services provider            DXC,      hotel and casino operator            Wynn Resorts,      technology company            Broadcom      and construction equipment manufacturer            Caterpillar,      the note said.Goldman analysts said barring a “significant change” in circumstances, the impact of coronavirus on U.S. equities would be focused on a select group of companies most exposed to China — including restaurant owner            Yum China      and component manufacturer            Qorvo.When it comes to sectors, airlines and gaming will be the most affected, due to travel restrictions and U.S. casinos operating in Macau — particularly as the Lunar New Year is the most lucrative time for gaming, they added.U.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Seeing “5G tailwinds” for makers of mobile-phones, Citi analyst Atif Malik this afternoon raised his price targets on two companies.Malik raised the price target on            Skyworks Solutions      stock (ticker: SWKS) to $125 from $98, and raised the price target on            Qorvo      stock (QRVO) to $118 from $98. In both cases, he keeps Neutral ratings, citing concerns about both “long-term China substitution risk at Huawei and concentration risk at            Apple      (AAPL).” Malik says his move comes in response to a positive December quarter earnings announcement Monday from the London-based chip maker            Dialog Semiconductor      (DLGNF).  Dialog Monday announced that revenue for its December quarter would be about $381 million, above the midpoint of its previous guidance range of $350 million to $390 million. Dialog makes mixed-signal chips for power management, Buetooth, backlighting, and various other applications for customers such as Apple, Xioami, Huawei Technologies, and            Samsung.Malik writes that historically, fundamentals at mobile-chip makers like Skyworks and Qovo “correlate decently” with conditions at Dialog. In a note last month, Malik placed Skyworks on Citi’s “catalyst watch list,” anticipating that the stock would outperform over the next few months based on strong holiday sales, the expected Apple SE2 iPhone launch in the first quarter, last week’s CES conference in Las Vegas, and Mobile World Congress next month in Barcelona.Dialog stock rallied 5.2% to $54.80 on Monday. Skyworks stock surged 3.7% to $124.51. Qorvo stock rose 2.1% to $115.74. Write to Eric J.

0,"With semiconductor stocks up more than 55% this year, the chip sector is an increasingly tough place for bargain hunters to find opportunity. But Vivek Arya, semiconductor analyst at BofA Securities, has taken up the challenge—in a research note Monday, he offered up six ideas on value-priced chip stocks to buy despite this year’s robust sector rally.Arya divides his list of Buy-rated bargains into three categories: compute, diversified and smartphone.In the “compute” category, he picks            Intel      (INTC) and            Broadcom      (AVGO), both of which have produced returns this year that fell well short of the overall chip sector—Intel is up 24%, Broadcom 29%. Arya writes that “compute” remains his preferred area in semis, with exposure to cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and 5G, which he says should make the group more resilient even in a tougher macro environment.The analyst says            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) are his favorite picks in this area, but that Intel and Avago are cheaper, trading at multiples of earnings and cash flow well below peers. Arya notes that both companies face competitive and business headwinds, but that both companies have underperformed the SOX semiconductor index for two years running, and “offer catch up potential as secular trends emerge in 2020.”Among diversified chip makers, Arya recommends            NXP Semiconductors       (NXPI) and            ON Semiconductor      (ON). He asserts that thawing of U.S./China trade tensions could boost industrial sector confidence and lift demand for companies that make microcontrollers, discrete components and analog chips. The analyst notes that both companies have appreciated just 5%-6% since the start of 2018, versus 40% for the SOX, and trade at a discount to peers. For NXP, he notes that the company has a $2 billion buyback plan in place, and adds that having its home base in the Netherlands gives it advantages over U.S. companies with China customers. In the smartphone category, his value picks include both            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) and            Qorvo      (QRVO), asserting that 5G wireless could offer “a multi-year investible theme.” He thinks both companies offer “compelling value” given potential for 10%-plus sales growth and 15%-plus EPS growth for the next three years. “While these stocks have done well since their Q3 reports, we note they underperformed for 4 years prior, and that there is substantial upside to earnings with less than 1% 5G penetration in 1.4 billion-plus global smartphones and hundreds of millions of connected Internet of Things devices currently.”On a strong day for chip stocks, all six stocks are trading higher Monday.

All Rights ReservedIt’s been an odd year for semiconductor stocks. Fundamentally, 2019 has been challenging. For the full year, industry revenue, excluding the volatile memory sector, will be down 6% to 8% this year, after 8% growth in 2018, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur. But the stocks have been on a rip-roaring rally. The strong performance reflects anticipation of better fundamentals ahead—a recovery Sur thinks will drive further stock gains.So far this year, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (ticker: SOX) has soared 55%, well ahead of the 32% gain for the        Nasdaq Composite      and a 26% rally by the        S&P 500.      In a research note Monday morning, the J.P. Morgan analyst writes that he sees the rally extending from here. Sur projects 15% to 20% gains for the average semiconductor stock over the next 12 to 18 months, as fundamentals improve. He projects 2020 overall semiconductor industry revenue growth of 4% to 7%, with profits improving 8% to 12%.“We see strength in mobile, gaming, datacenter, and PCs with industrial demand trends likely to improve in 2020—overall driving a positive year-over-year cyclical inflection in industry growth” starting in the first half of 2020, he writes. “Longer-term, we continue to expect the semiconductor industry to exhibit relatively stable and less cyclical growth characterized by low-to mid-single-digit percentage annual revenue growth and high single-digit percentage unit growth.”Sur’s top pick in semis is            Broadcom      (AVGO), based on “under-appreciated diversification,” strong free cash flow, and dividend growth.

1,"With 5G wireless mobile phones on the way, the time has come to buy shares of the key radio component vendors, according to BofA Global Research analyst Vivek Arya.Arya today did a “double upgrade” of both            Skyworks Solutions      (ticker: SWKS) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) to Buy from Underperform. He lifts his price target for Skyworks to $122 from $92, and for Qorvo to $130 from $90. He also repeats a Buy rating on            Broadcom      (AVGO), which he also expects to benefit from the growth in 5G handsets.“In our view, 5G could prove to be one of the more compelling and investible themes in semis, driven by the exponential growth in components required to upgrade ~1.4 billion 4G smartphones and several hundred million IoT Internet of Things devices,” Arya writes in a research note. “Radio Frequency chips will be a critical enabling technology to help monetize expensive spectrum and enhance battery life.” He says the first round of 5G stock investments focused on infrastructure plays, including            Marvell Technology      (MRVL),            Analog Devices      (ADI) and            Xilinx      (XLNX), but that the next phase could also favor RF chip stocks that have underperformed the PHLX Semiconductor Index since 2015.Arya notes that 5G technology should provide 10 times the bandwidth, requiring “highly complex/integrated RF components.” BofA sees $12.6 billion in RF sales this year, with growth accelerating to 14% annually over the next three years, from just 2% over the last three years. He says 5G phone adoption should grow from under 20 million this year to 200 million next year and 450 million in 2021.

0,"The financial markets are reeling—and investors are reeling with them. Slammed by generational volatility, many stocks look like bargains. But who can stomach jumping into the water when the waves are pushing the stock-market seas up and down 5% or more each day? Picking winners and losers in this environment might feel like a fool’s errand. But starting to sort through the sea of opportunity is a wise idea. To help stay engaged in this market, investors should embrace the power of the stock screen to find names with the right mix of factors for this moment. Even in good times, stock screens are one of the most useful tools an investor has. They can yield a funnel of new ideas, even if one shouldn’t buy a stock based on a screen alone. In calmer times, some investors look for faster-than-average growth, while others favor cheaper-than-average valuation multiples. In the Covid-19 storm, traditional screens look inadequate. Screening for multiple factors simultaneously will help. Using a mix is a little like two-factor authentication, which made the digital world far safer. As many remote workers can already attest, users enter passwords and then get texts or emails with confirmation codes. It reduces the chances for nasty surprises, such as identity theft. For our multifactor stock-authentication screen, we settled on a combination of cash flow, debt, earnings growth, and valuation. That would help us get rid of bargain stocks that were cheap for a reason, or avoid paying through the nose for fortress balance sheets. As a proxy for cash-flow stability, we looked for        S&P 500      companies that generated positive free cash flow in 2008 and 2009—during the financial crisis. Cash generating ability is at a premium again as Covid-19 dramatically slows the economy. We then kept only the companies with below-average debt and an absence of large, near-term debt maturities. Finally, we kept only those with below-average valuations and a demonstrated ability to grow earnings. In other words, we wanted a history of growth at a reasonable price.About 40 companies made the cut. Turning a stock screen into stock selection is more art than science. We took the relatively more attractive stocks across many sectors, and we looked for any additional catalysts that might boost stock performance down the road. Our final 12, in no particular order:            Caterpillar      (CAT),            Merck      (MRK),            UnitedHealth      (UNH),            Intel      (INTC),            Honeywell International      (HON),            Best Buy      (BBY),            W.W. Grainger      (GWW),            D.R. Horton      (DHI),            Qualcomm      (QCOM),            Akamai Technologies      (AKAM),            Lockheed Martin      (LMT),            BlackRock      (BLK). The dozen are down about 18% year to date, a little better than the drop of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      They have little debt, on average, and trade at a 25% discount to their own valuation history. And each has a story. Caterpillar makes diggers and dump trucks and bulldozers, huge machines ordered months in advance. It’s what is known as a long-cycle industrial business. Bank of America analyst Ross Gilardi cut his 2020 Cat earnings estimates Friday—the virus impacts everyone—but he noted the company had a strong balance sheet and a 4% dividend yield. Grainger is an industrial distributor, selling lots of small-ticket items that turn over quickly. The company, historically, has generated growth and cash flow in most economic environments, in part because it can swiftly scale operations up or down, depending on demand. It also sells a lot of safety products, like masks and cleaning solutions—items in high demand today. The stock trades for about 14 times estimated earnings, a discount to the broader market’s 15.8 times. Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, isn’t completely dependent on the health of the broader economy. And in the case of Merck and            UnitedHealth      —two health-care stocks—the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic front-runner has eliminated some of the political risk for the sector. Yes, this time is different. In the past 80 years, we’ve faced wars, banking crises, and recessions. We haven’t dealt with a global pandemic that threatens to grind the global economy to a halt. But even now, opportunities are revealing themselves. Investors just need a place to start.

0,"The semiconductor sector could see earnings fall as much as 70% on average if the coronavirus pandemic triggers a global recession, according to Citi.“We believe it is time to assume a recession is coming given the extreme disruption happening to several businesses,” analyst Christopher Danely writes in a new research note. “As a result, we analyzed how far estimates fell in past downturns. We are not lowering estimates as we believe this is an exercise in futility given we’ll just have to change them again in a month and it is impossible to gauge how bad things can get.”Danely writes that his analysis of previous downturns from 2008-2019 indicates average consensus estimates can fall as much as 70% on average—with some declining 100%. In the 2008 downturn, the mean chip stock earnings estimate fell 70%—and the        PHLX Semiconductor Stock      Index, fell a stunning 88%, drastically outpacing the 39% decline in the        S&P 500.      The analyst says the companies in his coverage universe that have historical had the smallest cuts to estimates are            Xilinx      (ticker: XLNX) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), noting that both also have been among the best-performing stocks in a downturn. He thinks Xilinx will see relatively small estimate cuts this time, but that Qualcomm could have issues “given all the demand destruction in cellphones.”Danely says the largest cuts to earnings estimates historically have been suffered by            Micron      Technology (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). He thinks AMD again is likely to suffer among the largest estimate cuts, but Micron “might buck the trend.”The companies that interest Danely the most right now are            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and Micron. “Texas Instruments has been among the best performers so far during the downturn and we would expect that to continue,” he writes. “Microchip has been among the worst performers but we believe it is unwarranted and would aggressively buy the stock. We also believe Micron might buck the trend given the oligopoly in DRAM and strength in the server end market.”He also notes that “checks indicate server demand has remained strong throughout the volatile order patterns, due...to trends of more people working from home and online demand for various products.” That’s good news for            Intel      (INTC), AMD, and Micron.Semiconductor stocks have recovered more than 6.5% on Tuesday, well ahead of the 4.7% rebound by the S&P 500.

0,"Qualcomm      shares are getting a boost from Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong, who picked up coverage of the communications chip company with a Buy rating and $98 price target. Wong sees Qualcomm (ticker: QCOM) as a broad bet on mobile communications. He notes that the company has a portfolio of more than 140,000 cellular patents, and generates license payments from essentially every smartphone maker in the world other than Huawei Technologies. (And that one is under active negotiation, he points out). Wong also notes that the leading smartphone makers, including Apple,            Samsung,      Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo all use Qualcomm’s modem chips in some current or upcoming 5G phones.Wong sees the company getting a big revenue boost from the shift to 5G phones. Qualcomm anticipates that it will get 50% more revenue from 5G phones than from 4G phones. The analyst expects the company’s quarterly sales to grow to $7.4 billion in the September 2021 quarter, from $4.8 billion two years earlier, driven by increased Apple iPhone modem sales, greater dollar content with 5G, and market-share gains. Longer term, he sees growth opportunities for Qualcomm in the Internet of Things and automotive markets.The analyst also notes that Qualcomm has a history of returning capital to holders. Over the past three years, the company has repurchased $26 billion of its stock and paid out $10 billion in dividends. Tuesday morning, the company lifted its dividend by 5%, boosting the annualized payment to $2.60, which gives the stock a yield of 3.4%.The shares were 4.1% higher at $75.65 in afternoon trading.

0,"Qualcomm      stock’s recent decline still doesn’t make the shares appealing, according to Piper Sandler. Last month, Qualcomm (ticker: QCOM) initially rallied after it reported adjusted fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of 99 cents, above the 85 cents Wall Street had expected. Revenue of $5.06 billion was also higher than expectations of $4.84 billion, but the shares have fallen more than 10% over the past few weeks due to uncertainty over the coronavirus outbreak.On Wednesday, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar initiated coverage on Qualcomm shares with a Neutral rating. He has an $80 price target on the stock.“We believe the current valuation properly reflects the company’s positioning in 5G mobile,” he wrote. “We are wary of current valuation given the potential near-term coronavirus risk to 5G handsets.”The outbreak and the travel restrictions that have resulted are expected to cut into consumer demand. Last month,            Apple      said the company would not meet its sales guidance for the March quarter because of the coronavirus’s impact on its supply chain and weaker demand in China.Qualcomm stock was up 3.9% to $80.97 on Wednesday, while the        S&P 500      was 3.5% higher.The analyst expects more competition in the market for 5G chips in the coming years. He noted currently Qualcomm is the only vendor selling a complete “end-to-end” offering of 5G chipsets.“We view the stock as more or less fully valued at current levels, as it trades roughly in-line with its peer group and has potential competitive headwinds on the horizon,” he wrote.Other Wall Street analysts are also mixed on Qualcomm. About 57% have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 43% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet.

1,"As U.S. stocks continue to set record highs led by the fastest-growing companies, growth stocks have trounced value in recent years. With the bull market over a decade old and valuations toward the high end of their historical range, many have called for a comeback in value investing.Growth stocks are most simply defined as those that are expected to increase their earnings or revenues at a faster rate than the rest of the market. Value stocks are those that trade at a discount to the market on various fundamental measures.But why choose one strategy when you can have both? Barron’s decided to look for stocks in the        S&P 500      that exhibit characteristics often sought out by both growth and value investors. They’re cheap on one key metric, but also expected to increase earnings faster than their peers this year. Read Next: These Are the 100 Most Sustainable Companies in AmericaThe index’s average free cash flow yield—a measure of return—is currently 3.7%. Analysts also expect the S&P 500 to grow earnings per share by 8.1% in 2020. Here are the dozen stocks in the S&P 500 that are at least 75% more attractive than the index on both metrics.Source: FactSet, BloombergPerhaps unsurprisingly, a pair of energy companies top the list:            Valero Energy      (ticker: VLO) and            Marathon Petroleum      (MPC). The sector is coming off a tough year with a persistently low oil price that’s weighed on many companies’ performances. That’s caused investors to avoid the sector, and made the stocks cheap. Marathon’s free cash flow is almost 12% of its market value, while Valero’s is almost 11%.While many oil and gas stocks are unlikely to see an upswing without a higher oil price, analysts are confident about rebounds at Valero and Marathon—to the tune of 82% and 62% earnings per share growth, respectively. Both recently raised their dividends. Barron’s suggested that investors should have some exposure to energy companies in their portfolios earlier in February.Bristol-Myers Squibb      (BMY) stock has been held back by merger controversy over much of the past year. Its shares tumbled in early January after it announced that it would be acquiring the biotech firm Celgene. Investors took some time to come around to the deal, which closed in late 2019. At the stock’s current level it yields almost double the free cash flow of the S&P 500 index. Analysts see several promising drug projects at the newly combined company, and expect earnings per share to jump 43% in 2020.Qualcomm      (QCOM) stock has had its share of headwinds including limits on business with Huawei, an antitrust investigation in Europe, and most recently supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus in China. But analysts are bullish on the company’s opportunities in the shift to next-generation 5G networks. The stock’s free cash flow yield is at a healthy 6.5%, and Wall Street expects 22.2% earnings per share growth this year.General Motors      (GM) has long traded at an alluringly cheap multiple. But this one could simply be a value trap. There has been little appetite for traditional auto makers like GM.            Tesla       (TSLA) captures all the electric-vehicle enthusiasm, while tech players like            Alphabet’s      (GOOGL) Waymo unit are way ahead on autonomous-driving capabilities. GM is making an effort in both future areas, but investors have proven skeptical of the company’s long-term prospects—even at its current 15% free cash flow yield and with earnings per share forecast to rise 28% in 2020.Other stocks with potential value and growth appeal include            H&R Block       (HRB),            State Street      (STT),            Alliance Data Systems      (ADS), and            Anthem      (ANTM).

0,"The world’s second-largest economy has ground to a virtual halt as China grapples with the deadly coronavirus. Nearly 60 million people have been quarantined, and stores and production lines are still largely shut. Even once the virus is contained, side effects will linger for many companies. The outbreak has infected more than 60,000 people and killed more than 1,300, inflicting an unquantifiable wave of suffering. When it comes to companies, the pain isn’t limited to those heavily reliant on China for sales or that operate facilities in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.The city is a center for auto, electronics-component, and semiconductor production, but it’s also a transport hub—much like Chicago—making it even more crucial to the global supply chain. The takeaway: Disruptions could ripple through an array of industries and hurt sales and earnings, possibly throughout the year.Tourism-related companies are feeling some of the most acute pain. China estimates 13 million individual passenger flights were canceled, and            Delta Air Lines      (ticker: DAL) and others have suspended flights to the mainland until March. Cruise operators are under siege as they approach a key period for bookings.            Wynn Resorts      (WYNN) is losing $2.6 million a day as Macau closed casinos. While markets have priced in a near-term drop in demand and brief supply-chain disruptions, the wider indirect fallout hasn’t been factored in, says Anh Lu, manager of the T. Rowe Price New Asia fund. “Everyone thinks everything is going to bounce if demand comes back, but previous incidents have shown that not every company will benefit the same way,” she says.The next couple of weeks will determine if the virus is contained. Many fund managers expect a sharp rebound in markets once the outbreak appears to be contained and factories restart, with            Deutsche Bank      estimating a 0.2% hit to full-year global economic growth—some of which will be recovered in 2021.While China President Xi Jinping has reportedly called for a loosening of restrictions, production is still halted and many workers stranded. Parts aren’t available—or companies are unable to provide the required face masks for workers due to a shortage. Even in the best-case scenario—operations gradually restart—the virus is going to deal China the biggest hit to growth since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Gavekal Research analysts Andrew Batson and Ernan Cui.As production resumes, fund managers will look for opportunities, though selectively. Companies with pricing power may be able to split the costs related to the virus—such as paying overtime or expediting orders to make up for lost time—with customers. But weaker companies could see margins deteriorate, and those burdened with a lot of leverage could struggle to make it even through the initial fallout. In a note to clients, UBS Global Wealth Management recommended a short-term playbook that favored high-dividend payers with strong cash flow while avoiding vulnerable companies in Asia. Here are some of the companies analysts and fund managers are monitoring for signs of weakness. Consumer stocks. Companies catering to Chinese consumers have been a bright spot in many global managers’ portfolio for years. But they are far from immune. Take liquor companies. Lunar New Year is a big time for alcohol consumption, and retailers, bars, and restaurants had stocked up in anticipation. But most large gatherings were canceled—and that lost demand is unlikely to be recovered. Inventory won’t need to be replenished for a long time. “Even when people resume going out, manufacturers might not get new orders for a while,” says Donny Kranson, co-manager of the Vontobel International Equity strategy. Shares of spirits maker            Diageo      (DEO) are down 3.7% so far this year, while            Budweiser Brewing APAC      (1876.Hong Kong), the Asia-Pacific subsidiary of the beer maker, is down 11%.The outbreak could also change attitudes toward eating out.            Meituan Dianping      (3690.Hong Kong), a darling among emerging market investors, has fallen 12% from a recent high last month. Only about 20% to 30% of restaurants have been opened for food delivery, and delivery volumes appear to be down 50% or more at the majority of those that are open, according to Bernstein analyst David Dai. Widely held luxury retailers and cosmetics companies like            LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton      (MC.France) and            Estée Lauder      (EL) won’t escape unscathed. Luxury stores on the most fashionable streets around the world are empty as Chinese tourism has plummeted. LVMH has estimated a not-too-terrible hit to sales, while            Estée Lauder      cut its profit outlook for its fiscal second half, though it expects a rebound once travel resumes. Over the long term, the outbreak is unlikely to wean Chinese shoppers from luxury goods, but for now, fund managers are looking to cheaper pockets of the market, like industrials. Industrials. The sector was well-positioned for a global economic recovery previrus, and economists still expect one, just delayed. In the near term, though, industrial companies risk weakened demand, as well as supply-chain interruptions, yet most have not adequately discounted the blow from the virus in 2020 outlooks, Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC, wrote in a recent note. Two exceptions:            Emerson Electric      (EMR), which estimated a roughly $50 million to $100 million hit to sales, or a 1.5% hit to second-quarter revenue estimates, if factories had reopened on Feb. 10—and a greater impact if it extended beyond that—and            Xylem      (XYL), which could see a three- or four-cent hit to first-quarter earnings per share.  Technology. Companies linked to China’s 5G buildout—which is reliant on government spending—could also be vulnerable, as the government may need to focus on other priorities. Plus, Wuhan is known as China’s Optical Valley, home to much of the optical-component supply chain crucial to the 600,000 to 650,000 5G base stations planned to be operational in China by the end of 2020, says Matthew Sigel, managing director at Hong Kong–based broker CLSA. If the Chinese government continues to enforce travel and commerce restrictions within Wuhan, “we could see Wall Street’s earnings estimates for some of the handset and 5G supply chain adjust lower and/or get pushed into 2021,” Sigel says.            Qualcomm      (QCOM), the world’s largest maker of mobile phone chips and modems, warned of “significant uncertainty” around its handset demand and supply chain. Components like printed circuit boards, optical fiber, and displays face the biggest risks to production, while LCD, memory, and Chinese auto technology may be more resilient, Sigel adds.Goldman Sachs      highlights semiconductor and technology hardware companies as the most exposed group within the sector, with 47% and 14% of revenue, respectively, coming from Greater China. These two areas also are starting with valuations that had baked in some good news pre-outbreak—signs the semiconductor industry was about to emerge out of a downturn with better earnings-growth expectations for            Apple      (AAPL). The outbreak has cast a shadow over those assumptions.Apple has closed all its stores and corporate offices in mainland China and is at risk of major disruptions, with nearly half of its manufacturing and supply sites located in China. While iPhone assembler            Foxconn Technology      (2354.Taiwan) was expected to resume production this past week, reports suggest some of its factories will remain closed, while others are operating with 10% of the workforce. For every week business activity doesn’t resume from Feb. 10, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar estimates a two-cent-a-share hit to earnings from lost iPhone or service sales.Apple has factored some of the hit into its outlook, mitigating some of the risk, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani. Other companies Daryanani highlighted as worth monitoring include            Amphenol      (APH), which has roughly 30% of sales tied to China;            HP Inc.      (HPQ), which has about 70% of its manufacturing workers in China; and            Dell Technologies      (DELL), which has more than half of its suppliers in China. Citi China internet analyst Alicia Yap summed up the wariness of those on the ground: “We would be patient and wait for better entry points and assess the downside risks versus valuation before getting too excited.” Write to Reshma Kapadia at reshma.kapadia@barrons.comThe world’s second-largest economy has ground to a virtual halt as China grapples with the deadly coronavirus.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Qualcomm      said Wednesday that it is the subject of an antitrust investigation in Europe.The European Commission is investigating the company for anticompetitive behavior, over whether it leveraged its 5G baseband-processor market position in the radio frequency front-end chip market, Qualcomm said in a 10Q filing. The company received a request for information from the EC on Dec. 3.Radio frequency semiconductors enable smartphones to communicate with wireless networks.The company said that if a violation is found, the European Commission could impose a fine for up to 10% of the company’s annual revenue. It could also restrict its business practices. Qualcomm said it is difficult to predict the outcome for the investigation but doesn’t think its business practices violate European Union competition rules. Late Wednesday, Qualcomm posted better-than-expected earnings results for the quarter ended in December.

Huawei was the market leader with 37% of the market, most of those sold in China. Samsung had 36% of the market, selling 5G phones in a broader range of markets, including South Korea, the U.S. and the U.K. Vivo, which sells phones primarily in China, had 10.7% of the market. China-based Xiaomi, which sells phones in Western Europe as well as domestically, had 6.4% of the market. South Korea’s            LG      rounded out the top five, with a 4.8% share.The 5G phone sales last year were just the tip of the iceberg: the game will really get going in 2020. At the CES trade show in Las Vegas earlier this month,            Qualcomm      (ticker: QCOM) President Cristiano Amon predicted that 200 million 5G smartphones will be sold in 2020, and growing from there. Apple (AAPL) is going to be a little late to the party, with the company widely expected to introduce its first 5G phones this fall.

Without referring specifically to 5G, Apple CEO Tim Cook on the company’s earnings call Tuesday cautioned that the virus issue could affect both its partners in China and consumer demand in the country.

0,"The optimistic way to think about Monday’s mammoth selloff is that the market staged a giant clearance sale. And there are bargains to be had.RBC Capital Markets analyst Alex Zukin sorted through the carnage in the enterprise-software sector Monday night and found three names to recommend:            Salesforce.com      (CRM),            Zendesk      (ZEN), and            Workday      (WDAY). He’s not calling a market bottom, but Zukin thinks all three stocks deserve attention as you go picking through the wreckage.Salesforce, he writes, remains his top pick. The stock as of Monday’s close was down 21.6% since peaking on Feb. 20, and was just 6% above its recent Oct. 22 trough at $142.33. He finds that the cloud-software company has “multiple growth levers” to pull this year, with the completion of its acquisitions of Tableau and MuleSoft.“Salesforce is well positioned to gain wallet share among existing customers,” he writes. “We believe this position is even more enhanced should there be a protracted economic downturn in which IT budgets are cut and the number of vendors within typical IT environments gets rationalized, as Salesforce’s broad product portfolio, incumbent platform position, and leading enterprise go-to-market organization all combine to put the company in a pole position to support organizations’ digital transformations.”Zukin says the company’s current-year revenue guidance of 23% growth is conservative enough that a significant downward revision is unlikely even in a worsening macro environment. And he adds that Salesforce has something that the big crop of recent cloud-software IPOs lacks: longevity. “Salesforce was founded two decades ago, has seen multiple economic cycles, and we believe its leadership understands better than most how to position the company’s messaging and strategy to cater to customers’ changing needs in times of economic volatility,” he writes. “Additionally, as the company is one of the largest cashflow generators in the software sector, we believe it is well positioned financially to weather a potential downturn.”Zendesk, Zukin writes, “is among our favorite ideas as market volatility continues amid the COVID-19-related sell off.” Given the enterprise-software company’s “expanded product portfolio, conservative guidance, and attractive valuation,” the shares offer an opportunity “to buy one of the most strategic enterprise software names...we would be buying right here, right now.”Zukin writes that the company, which sells software used to run help desks, has been “vocal and open about the risks to its business that the coronavirus pandemic poses, with nearly 50% of the company’s bookings are outside the US, and a good portion of that in Asia.” Nonetheless, he finds that Zendesk is “well capitalized and in a strong position to withstand short-term pain,” with more than year’s worth of expense coverage on its balance sheet. He writes that Zendesk would “meaningfully outperform other names under coverage through an extended period of weaker demand trends.” And he adds that “in a weaker demand environment, customer retention remains critical, and we do not view Zendesk spend as discretionary for most customers.”Workday, Zukin argues, is “well-positioned to be a relatively safe haven in this storm.” He sees an opportunity to buy “a multi-year durable growth story in one of the most attractive markets in cloud software.” He notes that with the company’s software increasingly ingrained in HR and financial back-office systems, it would be inherently difficult to shut off Workday or switch to another provider. And he adds that the company has a customer base that skews to larger enterprises, with a net retention rate above 100%.Zukin has previously asserted that Workday could be an interesting acquisition candidate for            Microsoft      (MSFT), and he now adds that you can make the same case for            Amazon.com’s      (AMZN) Amazon Web Services or            Alphabet’s      (GOOGL) Google Cloud, the other key players in the public cloud. “In the coming war for data, owning the employee data graph, work graph, and social graph represents strategically significant opportunities that could power meaningful insights and create further commercialization opportunities” for a potential buyer, Zukin writes.Amid Tuesday’s broad market rebound, Salesforce is up 2.6%, at $155.17, Zendesk is up 3.6%, at $70.45, and Workday is up 4.1%, at $148.78.

1,"Technology stocks led the market’s rally to record heights, but the largest tech names have been swept up by the recent selling wave. Most of the leading tech companies now at or near bear market declines, down roughly 20% from their mid-February highs.The        S&P 500 Information Technology      sector closed at 1440.20 on Monday, down exactly 20% from its Feb. 19 peak. The info tech sector doesn’t include all of big tech -- (            Facebook      ticker: FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are in the Communications Services sector, for instance -- but the pain is generally universally. Microsoft      (MSFT) and            Apple      (AAPL) are hanging on to their position as the only U.S. companies with a market cap above $1 trillion, but both have suffered in the recent selloff. Microsoft is down 4.5% year to date, and off more than 20% from its closing high in mid-February. Bear markets are defined as drops of 20% or more.

0,"Wall Street is defending            Salesforce.com      after some investor uncertainty following the company’s management changes. Late Tuesday, Salesforce (ticker: CRM) posted better-than-expected earnings results for its January quarter. The cloud software vendor reported adjusted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 66 cents, above the 56 cents Wall Street had expected. Revenue of $4.85 billion was higher than expectations of $4.76 billion.It also announced Keith Block has stepped down as co-CEO of Salesforce.com, and Marc Benioff is now chair and CEO, driving the shares lower in after-hours trading Tuesday.On Wednesday, J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy reaffirmed his Overweight rating on Salesforce.com. He has a $200 price target for the stock.“Co-CEO Keith Block stepping down is disappointing and unexpected as investors might have viewed him as the heir-apparent,” he wrote. “We don’t think it will be material, and we expect the company, aided by a strong bench, to successfully execute through this transition.”The analyst said the strong fourth quarter results support his forecast for the company to grow about 20% annually for the next few years with strong profit margins.In similar fashion, Stifel analyst Tom Roderick on Tuesday reiterated his Buy rating for Salesforce stock. He also raised his price target to $220 from $210.“We think the unexpected nature of these announcements was the primary culprit behind the muted response to the strong print...but suggest that investors focus on the organic strength Salesforce reported across each of its core Clouds,” he wrote.  Other Wall Street analysts are uniformly bullish on Salesforce, with 91% having a Buy or Overweight rating on the stock, according to FactSet.Salesforce stock was down 1.8%, at $178.08, in recent trading.

The        Dow Jones Industrial Average,      for instance, had fallen seven of the past eight days as of Tuesday’s close. Hong Kong’s        Hang Seng Index      fell 0.7%. The U.K.’s        FTSE 100 Index      is off 0.7%. Dow futures are near the break-even line, while futures on both the        S&P 500      and        Nasdaq Composite      were a touch higher. All three indexes had fallen earlier in premarket action. With coronavirus fears heightened, gold and select heath-care stocks are rising in premarket trading. Gold miner            Newmont      (ticker: NEM) shares are up 1.2%.            Gilead Sciences      (GILD) shares have risen 1.9%. Travel shares, on the other hand, continue to be battered.            United Airlines      (UAL) stock is down almost 13% over the past few days. Shares are down another 0.4% in premarket trading. Earnings news is moving several other stocks. Virgin Galactic      (SPCE) held its first quarterly call as a publicly traded company Tuesday evening. Management outlined a plan to sort through the 8,000 or so inbound inquiries received about space tourism. Customers can lockup a place in the queue with a $1,000 deposit. Galactic is still an early-stage company without much in the way of sales or earnings yet. Shares are down 5.3% in premarket trading, but the stock is still up about 190% year to date. Like Galactic,            Salesforce.com      (CRM) shares are down 2.2% in premarket trading after the company reported earnings Wednesday evening. In the case of Salesforce, numbers exceeded Wall Street expectations, but investors wanted more. The shares are up 12% over the past three months.

Block is staying as an adviser to the CEO.SmileDirectClub      (SDC) stock is plummeting, down more than 27% in premarket trading. The company said Tuesday evening that sales in 2020 should reach about $1.05 billion. Wall Street predicted $1.06 billion in sales. It’s a small difference, but SmileDirect is highly valued. Shares trade for four times sales. The company isn’t profitable yet. Home-improvement retailer            Lowe’s      (LOW) reported stronger quarterly numbers Wednesday morning. Earnings of 94 cents a share beat analysts’ predictions of 91 cents. Still, the stock is off about 3% in premarket trading. Management’s earnings guidance for the coming fiscal year of about $6.55 in per share profits is a little below what the Street modeled. Finally, analysts’ rating changes are affecting some shares. Stock in apparel giant            Nike      NKE) is down about 1% in premarket trading after HSBC downgraded the company to the equivalent of Hold from Buy.

All Rights ReservedHedge funds remained overweight growth stocks in the fourth quarter, helping to boost their aggregate performance as the market rocketed higher. Some of the names most popular with retail investors are among hedge funds’ favorites too, including            Amazon.com,Microsoft,      and            Netflix.Uber Technologies      was the stock bought by the most number of hedge funds last quarter, according to data from Goldman Sachs.Hedge funds’ growth tilt boosted their returns in recent months, while the fast-growing stocks led the market higher. The most popular hedge fund positions are now Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN),            Facebook      (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL). Other well known stocks are high on the list, as well, including            Salesforce.com      (CRM) at sixth, Netflix (NFLX) at 10th,            Apple      (AAPL) at 12th, and Tesla (TSLA) at 43rd.Within 45 days of the end of each quarter, hedge funds must report their portfolio holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regulatory form known as a 13F. Goldman Sachs analysts have reviewed the holdings of 859 hedge funds that managed $2.3 trillion at the start of this year. Top value holdings for hedge funds in the fourth quarter included            Berkshire Hathaway      (BRK.B) and several big banks:            Citigroup      (C),            Bank of America      (BAC), and            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM). Overall, though, hedge funds are holding pricey stocks. “Our Hedge Fund VIP basket currently carries a 33% price-to-earnings premium to the broad S&P 500 (25x vs. 19x), the largest on record,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in their report. The 50 stocks—which the Goldman Sachs analysts call the Very Important Positions basket—returned 24% from the start of the fourth quarter until last week, while the        S&P 500      index rose 14%.Source: Goldman SachsThe most concentrated ownership by hedge funds in S&P 500 stocks is in            Incyte      (INCY) and            Expedia Group      (EXPE), each with at least 20% of their market value owned by hedge funds. Meanwhile,            First Republic Bank      (FRC) and Dow (            DOW      ) have been all but ignored by hedge funds, On a sector level, managers slightly increased their positioning in information-technology stocks, which remained their greatest portfolio weight on aggregate. Tech stocks made up 19.9% of aggregate assets, though that’s below the Russell 3000’s 22.0% tech sector weight.Compared with the wide-ranging        Russell 3000      index, hedge funds are most overweight consumer discretionary, which represents 15.3% of their combined holdings, almost 5 percentage points more than the index. Health care is the next greatest relative overweight, while financials and consumer staples are the most out-of-favor sectors.Hedge funds increased their tilt toward consumer discretionary the most in the fourth quarter, while reducing financials and energy—which became a hedge fund underweight to the Russell 3000 for the first time since 2007.The favorite new buy of hedge funds in the fourth quarter was Uber Technologies (UBER). That appears to have been a good call: The ride-hailing firm’s stock struggled after its initial public offering earlier last year, but it’s rebounded sharply in 2020. It had been among the most exited positions by hedge funds in the third quarter.Other big new buys include Tiffany (TIF), Expedia,            Home Depot      (HD),            Exxon Mobil      (XOM), and            Nvidia      (NVDA).

Since 2002, the stocks that saw the largest number of new hedge-fund investors in a quarter outperformed other stocks in their sector by an average of 0.52 percentage point in the following quarter.The Goldman team found the reverse holds true, as well: Stocks with the largest decline in the number of hedge-fund owners in a quarter have underperformed their sector peers by 0.60 percentage point over the next quarter.Here are the top 10 new adds and most exited positions by hedge funds in the third quarter:Source: Goldman SachsSource: Goldman Sachs Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.comHedge funds remained overweight growth stocks in the fourth quarter, helping to boost their aggregate performance as the market rocketed higher.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Slack Technologies      shares are trading sharply higher on Tuesday after RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin picked up coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $25 target price. “We see Slack as having a leading brand, differentiated technology, and strong tailwinds from a growing workplace collaboration market,” Zukin writes in a research note. The analyst sees “an opportunity for the company to have durable, multiyear 30%+ growth.”Zukin concedes that “the jury is still out on the ultimate size of this market.” While Gartner estimates a $2 billion opportunity and Slack (ticker: WORK) sizes the market at $28 billion, RBC sees an $86 billion addressable market. The analyst contends that the fact that            Microsoft      (MSFT) is all-in on this market “would suggest something closer to the latter than the former.”  Competition from Microsoft Teams has been hanging over the stock since Slack listed its shares last year. But Zukin contends that “Slack is the leader in this space” from both a brand and feature perspective, and “remains in an early growth phase with a defensible competitive position and significant monetization potential.”He thinks revenues could double if Slack were to just win the majority of the collaborative communications market for software developers. “IDC estimates a global developer population of 22 million, and we believe that number can potentially double over the next decade,” he writes. “Slack management has suggested that roughly 40% of the company’s 12 million daily active users are technical users today...If the company were able to take a dominant 60% share of the developer market, it could maintain a 30%+ growth trajectory for the next 3-5 years.”Zukin says Slack trades at about a 30% discount to other companies growing revenues better than 50% on an enterprise value to projected 2021 revenue multiple basis. He also floats the idea that the company would make a logical acquisition target for a number of companies, including            Amazon.com,      Alphabet (GOOGL),            Cisco Systems      (CSCO),            Salesforce.com      (CRM), and            Atlassian      (TEAM).

0,"After the annual January gabfest called the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the outlook for so-called ESG investing—for environmental, social, and governance factors—brightened considerably, with the world refocusing on climate change as a major risk. The E in ESG, after all, deals squarely with the climate. Beyond climate, what else happens with ESG, a popular investing strategy, in 2020? Keep reading for more.1. Climate becomes first among equals in ESG. “The World Economic Forum risk map determines that all five top risks are now climate-change related, with extreme weather as the number one global risk. Climate change was by far the most discussed and actionable theme this year in Davos, from both a market and corporate perspective,” Haim Israel,            Bank of America’s      head of thematic investments research, told Barron’s in an email. Israel warns that 1.8 billion people could suffer absolute water scarcity by 2025, 800 million people are at risks from rising sea levels, and “climate migration” could reach 143 million from Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. There is even a climate angle to the coronavirus, which originated in a Wuhan market where wild animals are traded illegally. As wild animals lose their habitats due to pollution and deforestation, new diseases will attack humans. At the Davos conference,            Salesforce.com      (ticker: CRM) announced it would plant a trillion trees over the next 10 years. Bank of America (BAC) said it achieved carbon neutrality earlier than expected.            Starbucks      (SBUX) committed to a 50% reduction in emissions. “Having hit a tipping point, we can expect to see substantial rapid and perhaps unexpected change in how companies are addressing climate change,” said John Streur, CEO of Calvert Research & Management.2. Central banks will speak loudly about climate risks in 2020. This year, the Bank for International Settlements—the central bank for central banks—said that climate change could trigger “potentially extremely financially disruptive events that could be behind the next systemic financial crisis.” At Davos, European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde sparred with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about global warming. Other central banks are also sounding the alarm. Last year, the San Francisco Fed held its first conference on climate change. 3. Wall Street will write lots more than you’ve seen in the past 10 years about climate change. “The fact that Davos made climate change a major discussion theme demonstrates they’re under a lot of pressure to do something about this issue. Prosperity has been fueled by fuel,” says Ed Yardeni, the financial market researcher. There are plenty of short-term implications for shareholders, he notes: “How does this impact the outlook for spending plans and earnings if companies wind up having to spend more to reduce their carbon footprint? This will weigh on earnings.” You’ll see more reports like            Société Générale’s      recent “What impact do high-level ESG controversies have on share prices?” (answer: quite a lot, mostly negative) or RBC Capital Markets’ new “ESG Scoop.” 4. Global warming will present lots of money-making opportunities. The climate solutions market could double from $1 trillion a year now to $2 trillion a year by 2025, says BofA’s Israel, including renewables, electric vehicles, batteries, biofuels, and circular economy plays. In addition, “moonshots” such as climate-controlled farming and carbon capture may draw lots of investor money. Janney Montgomery strategist Mike Halloran believes opportunities can be found in industrials (50% of energy consumption), agriculture (11% of global greenhouse gas emissions), and mining (12% of emissions).5. Divestment from fossil fuels will increasingly be normalized, particularly after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a couple of days before Davos, announced that the behemoth firm’s active funds would limit investing in coal companies.Investors like Asha Mehta, director of responsible investing at Acadian Asset Management, had already haircut investments for a possible carbon tax. Partly as a result, the energy sector has shrunk from 16% of the S&P 500 in 2008 to 5% today. As $20 trillion is poised to be invested in ESG funds over the next few decades, including new fossil-fuel-free funds, capital allocation to energy could fall more. However, don’t expect demand for oil to disappear overnight. Says Larry Jeddeloh of the Institutional Strategist: The strongest hydrocarbon companies won’t disappear either.6. Partly as a result, ESG is expected to keep outperforming, unless oil snaps back sharply. First is the vogue for quality growth stocks at a time when earnings growth has disappointed. Second, according to Furey Research, ESG performance data is being skewed by the outperformance of technology and the dreadful performance of energy. “Once you ‘sector neutralize’ the results, the advantage of higher ESG scores vanishes. The highest ESG score quartile is made up almost entirely of technology, financial and consumer stocks,” the firm notes. 7. ESG will stay a stock pickers’ dream as investors look for momentum as a way to find promising companies. “Sustainability momentum—that’s where the magic is going to happen,” says Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance. Adds Saker Nusseibeh, CEO of Hermes, a unit of          Federated Investors      : “If something comes out that’s bad on ESG, the tendency is to underweight that company. One of the ways to make money is to have some negative exposures on our understanding of the ESG metrics, and engage with the company” to ensure ESG improves. Among other things, Hermes keeps statistics on how companies respond to engagements.8. Corporate reporting will become more specific about climate and other ESG risks. Companies will supply more scenario modeling in their reports to form “a baseline view of value at risk” under various climate scenarios, says Emily Chew, global head of ESG at Manulife Investment Management. More companies will disclose information according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework, which advises that any ESG data disclosed should be financially material and reported consistently. 9. Expect to hear lots more about stakeholder capitalism.Proponents of this trend argue that stakeholders, including employees and customers, are just as important to companies as shareholders, as the Business Roundtable said in its revised “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation” last year. “Stakeholder capitalism is the systems reboot we need.... It will make companies more resilient to downside risks,” JUST Capital CEO Martin Whittaker wrote in a post from Davos.10. Though E is first among equals this year, there will be progress on S and G too. Goldman Sachs      will require IPO clients to have at least one “diverse” board candidate before the bank takes them public this year, and at least two starting next year. Big index investors will also deploy their votes on ESG. For example, State Street Global Advisors may vote against boards that have “consistently” lagged peers’ ESG ratings. ESG resolutions received support from nearly 30% of shares voted at annual meetings for U.S. companies during the last proxy season, according to Morningstar. Still, the SEC is looking to tighten rules regarding shareholder proposals. Says Leslie Samuelrich, CEO of Green Century Funds: “It’s a significant attack on shareholders at a time that shareholders are flexing their muscles more.”11. Lenders care way more about ESG. Banks will look more closely at ESG risk in making corporate loans. Meanwhile, green bonds—those earmarked for climate and environmental projects—will come into vogue. “With the growth of the green bond market, you’re sitting down with the CFO,” says William Sokol of Van Eck, which runs the VanEck Vectors Green Bond exchange-traded fund (GRNB). Nearly $200 billion of new green bond issues came out in 2019, and more are expected. “As demand for ESG-friendly assets continues to grow quasi-exponentially, the green bond asset class should also continue to witness some strong inflows for some time,” according to Sustainable Market Strategies. Adds MSCI: “Financiers will get creative with ways to bind ESG criteria to their terms of capital, introducing a plethora of corporate borrowers into the wide world of ESG.” 12. Flows will keep surging. Last year, flows into U.S. sustainable funds more than tripled, marking the fourth year of record flows, according to Morningstar. Talking about sustainability “is a way to build better relationships with clients. And it’s material to returns,” says Catherine Banat, managing director of responsible investing at RBC Global Asset Management. One beneficiary will be impact investing strategies—where people seek specific outcomes from their portfolios—many of which are aligned with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, according to the Global Impact Investing Network, assets in this market totaled around $500 billion, based on surveys with 1,300 impact investors. That will happen in mutual funds too: According to Morningstar, the largest impact funds include the $4.8 billion        TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond      (TSBBX), the $2.4 billion        Community Reinvestment Act Qualified Investment      (CRAIX), the $1.2 billion        Domini Impact International Equity      (DOMIX), and the $1.2 billion        AB Sustainable Global Thematic      (ALTFX).13. Expect more hiring in the sustainability industry—particularly of people who are great at building computer models and handling large data sets, and who are thick-skinned when dealing with corporate executives and officers. “There’s a global hiring war in ESG right now,” says Manulife’s Chew.

0,"It might be time for            Microsoft      to go shopping. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin asserts in a research note Thursday that 2020 could be a defining year for the software giant. He argues that Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) has “a unique opportunity to further elevate its cloud leadership position through share gains and needle-moving M&A.” The company’s huge run to a $1 trillion-plus valuation has been driven by the remarkable growth in its Azure cloud business, which is smaller than            Amazon.com’s      (AMZN) Amazon Web Services but growing faster—and Bracelin thinks the company can press its advantage with a smart deals. Read Next: The Dow Could Hit 30,000 Five Years Ahead of Schedule. It Won’t Stop There. Bracelin today repeated his Buy rating on Microsoft shares, lifting his target price to $190 from $158. The Piper analyst writes that with $67 billion in net cash and another $200 billion of projected future free cash flow over the next three years, “M&A could take center stage in 2020.” He notes that Microsoft has less than 5% market share in business application software, giving the company “many options” to boost its position in the enterprise beyond Azure, LinkedIn, Office 365, and GitHub.Bracelin points out that Microsoft has grown 8.5% on average over the past decade, but contends that the company is poised to see growth accelerate to a 12% annual rate over the next three years, driven by its cloud business. He notes that the company’s commercial cloud business has grown to 35% of revenue from 14% years three years ago, and that the total should top 50% by fiscal 2023, as the company’s cloud revenues eclipse $100 billion.He sees multiple drivers for potential upside performance by Microsoft this year, including cloud momentum, further expansion in the security software market, and the debut of the first new Xbox console in seven years. There are some offsets, though, he cautions—including the continuing shortage of            Intel      (INTC) microprocessors, which could affect Windows revenue, and the conclusion of the recent Windows upgrade cycle, with the termination of support for Windows 7.So what might Microsoft buy? “After applying Microsoft’s acquisition philosophy and framework across the business application software universe, we have identified potential acquisition targets that we would deem to be needle-moving pursuits,” Bracelin writes. With the caveat that there is zero evidence that any of these proposed deals are actually in the works—nor is anyone asserting they are—here’s his list of 10 potential targets:Microsoft stock is up 0.2%, at $166.01, in recent trading.

0,"Add servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

0,"Western Digital’s      stock is trading higher after a pair of analyst upgrades. They follow a recent selloff in the shares of the disk-drive and NAND memory chip company.Amid concerns about the impact on the tech supply chain from coronavirus, shares of Western Digital (ticker: WDC) had their own private bear market, falling 21% from Feb. 12 through Friday, while shares of rival            Seagate      Technology (STX) fell 15% over the same span.Stifel analyst Patrick Ho has lifted his rating on Western Digital shares to Buy from Hold, with a new price target of $73, up from $63. “While we clearly acknowledge that the current coronavirus situation could impact near-term estimates, we believe our fundamental outlook for 2020 remains intact,” Ho wrote in a research note issued over the weekend. Ho is in the camp that says the virus issue is simply pushing out demand for mobile phones, PCs, and other tech goods—not destroying it. “We believe the entire electronics ecosystem continues to experience levels of supply constraints, which could push out demand by a quarter or more,” he said. “We believe structurally, demand has not changed but the ability to produce products can impact the ability to meet near-term demand.”He added that “current tightness in the flash memory market is likely only to intensify as the supply chain gets further constrained in the near term. This will benefit the industry, as well as Western Digital if the supply tightness intensifies further.”Baird analyst Tristan Gerra lifted his ratings on Monday for Western Digital, Seagate, and            Micron Technology      (MU). He went to Outperform from Underperform on Western Digital, to Outperform from Neutral on Seagate and to Neutral from Underperform on Micron. His prices targets moved up to $75 from $60 on Western Digital, to $60 from $54 on Seagate, and to $55 from $45 on Micron.Gerra wrote that the outlook for both NAND and DRAM memory chip pricing looks positive for 2020 despite current demand weakness in China. Pricing will “remain resilient” throughout the year, and memory demand from server manufacturers remains strong, he says. And he thinks that stimulus plans in China “could drive a second-half demand rebound” for smartphones and PCs.He adds that Western Digital should benefit from improved product mix in hard disk drives and continued strength in data centers. And he thinks Seagate can gain market share, driven by demand for the company’s new 16 TB disk drives. He notes, though that “near term, supply chain disruption and weak demand in China for consumer segments such as PCs and surveillance cameras should negatively impact hard disk drive revenue, utilization rates, and gross margin, partially offset by initial signs of a rebound in the China server market and continued strength in the U.S. data center market.”WD shares bounced back on Monday, rising 5%, to $58.33. Seagate was up 2.3%, to $49.06, while Micron was up 1.8%, to $53.49. Write to Eric J.

1,"Seagate Technology      should benefit from rising demand from cloud-computing vendors, according to Stifel.Seagate (ticker: STX) makes hard-drives and offers storage solutions for consumers and corporations.Last month,            Intel      (INTC) reported stronger-than-expected December quarter results. The chip maker said its sales to the critical cloud-computing segment were up 48% year over year for the December quarter versus just a 3% rise in the prior quarter.Analysts think a robust cloud-computing market may help the hard drive market. On Sunday, Stifel analyst Patrick Ho increased his rating for Seagate to Buy from Hold. He raised his price target to $70 from $62. The company is scheduled to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings results on Tuesday.“We believe the recent market weakness has provided us an opportunity to be constructively more positive from both a fundamental and valuation perspective,” he wrote. “Fundamentally, we believe momentum continues in the near-term data center/hyperscale cloud computing environment and this should translate favorably for Seagate and the HDD industry as a whole.”Seagate stock was up 2.4%, to $58.38, on Monday.The analyst predicts continued demand strength for Seagate’s storage offerings from cloud-computing vendors this year. He also noted positive conservations with Asian component suppliers on hard-drive demand trends.Wall Street analysts are generally mixed on Seagate. About 29% have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 50% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet.Management has scheduled a conference call for 5 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday to discuss the results with analysts and investors.

0,"Consumers and companies alike are generating data at an astonishing rate, and you might think that this would be a great time to invest in disk-drive stocks. But Stifel analyst Patrick Ho advises proceeding with caution.This morning, Ho picked up coverage of the dominant disk-drive companies,            Seagate Technology      (STX) and            Western Digital      (WDC) with Hold ratings. He set targets of $62 on Seagate and $53 on Western Digital, slightly above recent prices for both. Read Barron’s Recent Cover Story: Tech’s Pioneers Have Been Left Behind. Their Stocks Are Cheap—and Complicated.Ho is more bullish about the fundamentals at Seagate, but finds the valuation of both stocks challenging at current levels.Ho writes in a research note that his Western Digital target price reflects a multiple of 1.3 times enterprise value to projected fiscal 2021 sales, in line with the stock’s average multiple over the past five years. He sees some potential tailwinds for the stock — including an anticipated rebound in NAND flash pricing and a pickup in hard drive demand — but adds that fundamental questions reduce his enthusiasm for both Western Digital and Seagate.“While we believe market dynamics in both HDD hard disk drives and NAND are improving, we also believe Western Digital lags somewhat in both on the technology front,” Ho writes. “We believe technology helps differentiate companies, and we will monitor how Western Digital responds to the changing needs of its customer bases.He adds that he has questions about the company’s capital structure, with a high debt load that could reduce future flexibility.For Seagate stock, Ho’s stock target reflects a 1.8x multiple of estimated fiscal 2021 revenue, which would match the company’s five-year peak valuation. But he cautions that “valuation upside is somewhat limited near term, given the stock’s strong run in 2019,” with a 55% gain year to date. That said, Ho sees some favorable near-term and long-term market dynamics for Seagate. “Near term, we believe a recovery in data center spending is transpiring, and this is likely to carry into 2020, driving potential upside to estimates,” he writes. “Long term, we believe the emergence of a ‘big data’ economy and the emergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other market needs will help drive HDD sales.” He adds that “the cost effectiveness and data-intensive needs for various data centers still make HDDs a very attractive ‘big data’ storage alternative, and we believe Seagate has a technology roadmap to meet these needs.”He notes that a key differentiator for Seagate is its HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) technology, which the company intends to use to boost its highest capacity drives from 16 terabytes today to 50 terabytes by 2026. “We are favorably biased on a fundamental basis on Seagate, but admittedly, we are seeking a better entry point into the name at current prices.”Both Western Digital and Seagate are trading fractionally higher early Monday.

1,"Ambarella      (AMBA) shares fell sharply Tuesday on news that two of the chipmaker’s largest customers are among 28 Chinese organizations added to a U.S. blacklist because of their role in human rights violations in China’s Xinjiang region. The expanded blacklist includes Hikvision and Dahua Technology, two of the world’s leading producers of video surveillance products. They are both key buyers of Ambarella’s image sensing chips.While Ambarella doesn’t disclose the size of its business with the two companies, analysts estimate that they make up 15% to 25% of Ambarella’s revenue. Companies added to the blacklist are restricted in their ability to buy components from U.S. vendors.In a statement, Hikvision objected to the U.S. government decision. “Hikvision strongly opposes the decision by the U.S. Government and it will hamper efforts by global companies to improve human rights around the world,” the company said. “Hikvision, as the security industry’s global leader, respects human rights and takes our responsibility to protect people in the U.S. and the world seriously.”Ambarella and Dahua didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore points out in a research note that the potential blacklisting of Hikvision has been a known risk for Ambarella shares for months, since the New York Times reported in June that the Commerce Department was considering adding Hikvision to the blacklist.Moore think there is a possibility that Ambarella will be able to ship to the two companies despite the blacklist. “If the same criteria that was used to determine U.S. content with regards to Huawei is used here, we think that the company could be able to continue shipping, as clearly over 75% of cost of sales is incurred outside of the U.S. (Samsung Foundry and Taiwan Assembly) and over 75% of the R&D resources to develop the product are outside of the U.S., primarily in China,” he writes. Moore also notes that the company’s Chinese customers could lose market share to other Ambarella customers, which would cushion the impact to Ambarella if it can’t ship to Hikvision and Dahua.On Tuesday, Moore reiterated his Overweight rating on Ambarella stock and his $60 price target on the shares, which were down 9% Tuesday morning to $52.07.“While there could be negative impact for the next couple of quarters, in our view near-term revenues have never been the primary reason to buy the stock, given the expected ramp of groundbreaking computer vision products,” Moore wrote. “We continue to see Ambarella as one of the more significant beneficiaries of a trade deal if and when one occurs.”Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg is more cautious the stock, reaffirming his Hold rating and reducing his price target to $54, from $61. “We believe that if the restrictions are similar to those applied to Huawei (based on IP origination), Ambarella could likely continue to ship its products to these customers, as it has a significant R&D presence outside the U.S.,” he wrote. “However, we expect that these restrictions could impact the camera manufacturers’ ability to acquire the full bill of materials which could negatively impact Ambarella’s end-market sales.”Moore also notes that            ON Semiconductor      (ON) has “low single digits” exposure to the surveillance market, and that disk drive stocks            Seagate      (STX) and            Western Digital      (WDC) also have modest exposure to the surveillance system companies.Ambarella stock took the biggest hit Tuesday, but ON Semiconductor is down 3.6%, Seagate is down 4.1%, and Western Digital is down 3.7%.

0," Best Four Months. After spending most of the day in the red, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to climb back into positive territory by the end of Tuesday. As of Tuesday’s close, the S&P 500 has gained 17.51% year to date, the best first four months of a year since 1987, when it gained 19.07%. The Dow is up 14% this year, its best start to a year since 1999 when it gained 17.51%.General Electric      stock (ticker: GE) rose 4.5% Tuesday on strong first-quarter earnings and other upbeat data.The Nasdaq Composite, on the other hand, lost 0.7% on Tuesday, as Google’s parent company            Alphabet      (GOOGL) saw its worst trading day since 2012 after first-quarter sales disappointed.Also in focus are the U.S.-China trade talks and a Federal Reserve statement on monetary policy due on Wednesday. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Will We See a Rate Cut? All three major U.S. indexes closed not far from the break-even line on Tuesday. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      rose 38.52 points, or 0.15%, to close at 26,592.91. The        S&P 500      added 2.80 points, or 0.10%, to end at 2945.83, and the        Nasdaq Composite      slipped 66.47 points, or 0.81%, to end at 8095.39.The Federal Reserve will conclude its May policy meeting on Wednesday and release the latest statement on monetary policy. The fed-fund futures market is overwhelmingly predicting unchanged rates for this meeting. However, some traders don’t think it will last long, given the mild inflation over the past few months despite the Fed’s pause in rate hikes since January. Monday data showed that core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 1.6% year over year in March, its slowest pace in 18 months.“Fed-fund futures traders are increasingly betting on a rate cut, even as data show an economic rebound could be in progress,” wrote John Lynch of LPL Research on Tuesday. Fed-fund futures are now pricing in a 40% chance of one rate cut, and a 20% chance of two rate cuts before the end of 2019, according to Lynch.President Donald Trump has weighed in as well, proposing that the Fed should cut rates by one percentage point and introduce quantitative easing to stimulate the economy like China does. “Our Federal Reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates, even though inflation is very low, and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening,” Trump tweeted, arguing the economy would “go up like a rocket” on reduced interest rates.Cutting rates by a full percentage point is rather extreme, even for the most bearish strategists. With economic growth of over 3% in the last quarter, as well as healthy wage growth and strong labor market, Lynch doesn’t see a Fed rate cut in the near future at all. The Fed has reduced its benchmark rate only 45 times since 1950, he noted, but only 12 rate cuts occurred after a quarter when output growth was above 3%. “In many of those instances, leading indicators had signaled impending weakness,” says Lynch.Tuesday’s economic data was mixed. China’s official manufacturing PMI fell 0.4 points to 50.1 in March, the U.S. Chicago PMI fell 6.1 points to 52.6, while the Eurozone’s preliminary gross-domestic-product growth came at 0.4% for the first quarter, beating the 0.3% consensus and the previous quarter’s gain of 0.2%. April’s consumer confidence went up 5.1 to 129.2, and March’s pending home sales rose 3.8% from the previous month.At the same time, crude prices settled higher on Tuesday, as Saudi Arabia said it will not rush to boost the oil supply, and the political crisis in Venezuela continued to deteriorate. Today, opposition leader Juan Guaido called for a military uprising to oust President Nicolas Maduro.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery rose 41 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $63.91 a barrel, while global benchmark Brent crude for June delivery rose 76 cents, or 1.1%, to end at $72.80 a barrel. The Hot Stock Seagate Technology      stock (STX) muscled its way to the top of the S&P 500 on Tuesday, thanks to its better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.Seagate stock climbed $3.38, or 7.5%, to $48.32.The storage-technology firm earned 83 cents a share on revenue of $2.31 billion, while analysts were looking for EPS of 71 cents on revenue of $2.32 billion. For the fourth quarter, it expects EPS to remain about flat, compared with the consensus estimate for 81 cents, and investors were also heartened by management commentary about a likely pickup in demand as the year wears on.In the past 12 months, Seagate stock is down 18.8%. The Biggest Loser Google parent Alphabet sank to the bottom of the index, on the back of its ‘shocking’ sales slowdown.Alphabet Class C shares (GOOG) lost $99.10, or 7.7%, to $1,188.48, while Class A shares (GOOGL) were the third-worst-performing stock of the day, falling $97.24, or 7.5%, to $1,198.96.The revenue miss was rare and troubling for Alphabet, to the point that the shares had their worst day in years on the news.In the trailing 12-month period, Alphabet stock is up 16.8%. –Teresa Rivas Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com Best Four Months.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"The departure of            Tesla’s      (ticker: TSLA) general counsel from the company after two months on the job marked the second high-level executive to leave in 2019—and the latest notable change in the company’s top leadership. Dane Butswinkas, the general counsel, is leaving the company to return to his practice in Washington, D.C. A statement provided by the company said he would continue to work with Tesla as outside counsel. (Barron’s covered that story separately earlier today.) He will be replaced by Jonathan Chang, current vice president of legal at Tesla.Investors and other observers have long watched comings and goings at Tesla closely, seeking insights about Elon Musk’s management style and signs of stability (or otherwise) as the company has evolved. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Barron’s collected a list of major departures from Tesla, posted below. Reuters recently published a more detailed list going back to 2016.• Last month, we learned that CFO Deepak Ahuja will leave. He’ll be replaced by Zach Kirkhorn, Tesla’s vice president of finance. • Gabrielle Toledano, Tesla’s Chief People Officer, left in October after less than two years. She’s now listed as an executive in residence at Comcast Ventures, a venture capital firm owned by            Comcast      (CMCSA). • Former Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton left in 2017 after spending less than a month on the job. Morton, a longtime            Seagate Technology      (STX) executive, is now CFO at software company Anaplan (PLAN). “The level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations,” Morton said in a statement at the time. • Former CFO Jason Wheeler also quit in 2017. That prompted the return of Ahuja, who had left two years earlier. Wheeler, a former executive at            Alphabet      -owned (GOOGL) Google, now describes himself as a professional speaker on LinkedIn.

0,"The enterprise-software sector isn’t going to be a haven from the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Analysts at both            Citigroup      and Jefferies weighed in on the group Wednesday morning, and both made wholesale estimate cuts for the enterprise-software companies they cover. These companies aren’t directly subject to supply-chain issues or reduced consumer demand, but they have an assortment of vulnerabilities nonetheless as the coronavirus dampens economic activity worldwide.Citi’s Walter Pritchard asserts that “the global reaction to the outbreak will cause some short-term impact on the ability of software companies to close business.” He notes that a number of companies report earnings this week—including            Adobe      (ticker: ADBE),            Oracle      (ORCL),            Slack Technologies      (WORK), and            DocuSign      (DOCU)—which will provide a fresh look at the impact of the virus on software demand. He’s keeping a close eye on Adobe and Oracle, both of which report February quarters and which have “meaningful Japan exposure.”Pritchard sees the companies affected by both soft demand in Asia and risk to high-touch sales models as travel is curtailed and trade shows and meetings are canceled. He also expects a hit to more transactional revenue, like advertising. Companies more tied to recurring revenue, where selling is less required, will be less vulnerable, he says. Pritchard cut estimates for many, but not all, of the companies he covers, noting that the most significant cuts affect            Ceridian HCM      Holding (CDAY),            Check Point Software Technologies      (CHKP),            CrowdStrike Holdings      (CRWD),            Dynatrace      (DT),            Guidewire Software      (GWRE), MicroStrategy (MSTR),            Open Text      (OTEX),            PTC      (PTC),            Splunk      (SPLK),            SAP      (SAP), and            Zscaler      (ZS).In a similar vein, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill cut estimates for 40 companies in his coverage universe for their current fiscal years by 1%-3%. Thill notes that over the past few weeks, a number of companies have already made cautious comments on the outlook.Microsoft      (MSFT), for instance, warned that it won’t reach its previous target in its “More Personal Computing” segment, which includes Windows.            VMware      (VMW) cited virus-related impact on Asian demand, and            Zendesk      (ZEN) pointed to virus risk at a recent analyst day. And Thill notes that March quarter guidance from companies on a normal calendar reporting scheduled likely provided their outlook before the global outbreak, and could be at risk.Thill says companies with exposure to perpetual licenses and multiyear on-premise licenses are most at risk, as travel restrictions reduce the mobility and impact of software sales and support staff. He cites            Check Point,Commvault      (CVLT), Oracle,            Palo Alto Networks      (PANW),            SailPoint      (SAIL),            Tufin Software Technologies      (TUFN), and VMware as companies with high license-revenue exposure. He sees more limited impact for companies with lower touch sales and implementation models. In that group, he includes            Atlassian      (TEAM),            Bill.com      (BILL),            Cloudflare      (NET),            SolarWinds      (SWI),            HubSpot      (HUBS),            Dropbox      (DBX), and Zendesk. Thill says            Intuit      (INTU) is “one of our most defensive names, with subscription-based small business accounting and predictable tax business.” He also likes            Citrix Systems      (CTXS), since “worker mobility is a potential long-term driver of incremental licenses and could benefit from increased remote working near-term.”The Jefferies analyst adds that he would be wary of companies with elevated revenue multiples, which he argues could be more vulnerable to sharp declines. Companies he covers trading at more than 15 times the next 12 months’ revenue include            Bill.com      (BILL),            Shopify      (SHOP),            Datadog      (DDOG),            RingCentral      (RNG),            Paycom Software      (PAYC), Atlassian, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and            Smartsheet      (SMAR).Thill suggests software investors focus on companies with strong fundamental stories and high profitability, calling out Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit,            ServiceNow      (NOW), and Ring Central.Amid a sharp, broad market decline Wednesday, almost all software stocks are trading lower.

0," Falling. The three major U.S. stock market indexes dropped as the number of coronavirus diagnoses rose and the latest U.S. economic data was solid but showed weakness in consumer spending and business investment. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average       dropped 210 points, or about 0.7%. The        S&P 500       was down 0.8% and the        Nasdaq Composite       lost 0.8%.  Midday Movers ServiceNow      (ticker: NOW) rose about 7% after the cloud-computing company reported earnings blew past Wall Street’s expectations and led to price-target raises from Bank of America and Citigroup.Mondelez International      (MDLZ) gained nearly 6.0% after the candy and snack company reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue.Facebook      (FB) dropped 6.7% after the social media giant reported above-consensus earnings, but said that expenses were growing faster than revenue growth. DuPont de Nemours      (DD) was down 7.7% after the company reported lower than expected earnings per share guidance for 2020. Altria Group      (MO) lost 5.8% after the tobacco company reported a loss in the fourth quarter and took a $4.1 billion charge on its investment in vaping company Juul, meaning that the company has cut a total of $8.6 billion off the value of its $12.8 billion investment in Juul in a little more than a year.

0,"Wall Street sees few obstacles in the way of            Salesforce.com      as it gobbles up enterprise software revenue, and analysts expect Tuesday’s earnings report to bolster their case for the stock’s 20% upside. After the Tuesday close, they expect Salesforce will announce that October quarter revenue rose 30%—bolstered by some acquisitions.The San Francisco-based software firm’s stock (ticker: CRM) was cruising along at $158.86 Monday morning. At nearly 60-times the FactSet consensus forecast for this year’s earnings, it flies in the upper reaches of software valuations. Nevertheless, analysts are with few exceptions bullish, and think Salesforce stock could hit $190.With the recent addition of the acquired MuleSoft and Tableau, sales probably hit $4.4 billion in the October period, analysts predict. They expect that earnings grew to 66 cents a share, from the prior-year period’s 61 cents, but the company has a history of upside earnings surprises. Analysts had forecast 48 cents in earnings for the July 2019 quarter, and Salesforce delivered 66 cents.J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy surveyed the company’s outside selling partners about the October quarter. Their revenue for the period was more than 5% above their sales plans, he reports in a recent note. His three-dozen survey respondents think Salesforce can hold its own against other cloud software contenders like            ServiceNow      (NOW),            Amazon.com      (AMZN) and            Microsoft      (MSFT). In late November, Salesforce held a gathering of its business affiliates and stock analysts. BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman wrote that he came away confident that operating income and cash flow will grow faster than most people expect. The stock is one of his top picks and he thinks it can reach $188.

1," Waiting for Direction. Stocks were little changed early Wednesday, with        Dow Jones Industrial Average      futures near the break-even mark, while        S&P 500      futures were off 0.1% and the        Nasdaq Composite      had risen 0.1% before the market opens. Earnings were doing little to boost investors’ moods, while worries about Brexit continue overseas. Here are five stocks making moves this morning:Boeing      (ticker: BA) was up 1.3% to $341.27 after saying it still expects its 737 MAX aircraft to return to service this year, overshadowing disappointing earnings. Caterpillar      (CAT) fell 0.6% to $133 after reporting disappointing third-quarter earnings and lowering its financial forecasts.Chipotle Mexican Grill      (CMG) was down 2.3% to $812.11, reversing previous gains, following its third-quarter earnings. ServiceNow      (NOW) slid 6.8% to $212.93. Its CEO left to become the chief executive of Nike (NKE).

0,"ServiceNow      tumbled 10% on Tuesday afternoon after its chief executive was named the new CEO of            Nike,      effective early next year. The back story. Nike shares (ticker:NKE) have jumped nearly 29% year to date, compared with a 19.5% gain for the        S&P 500      in the same period, and ongoing struggles for many of its retail peers. The trade war hasn’t hit Nike as hard as some feared, and while some analysts are worried about the impact on sales in China, bulls have been quick to point to other catalysts for the stock, including its product innovation, high-profile athlete brands, and its most recent earnings report, at the end of last month, which beat expectations.  What’s new. After the close of regular trading Tuesday, Nike said that John Donahoe will become CEO, beginning on Jan. 13. Donahoe currently serves as the CEO of ServiceNow and has been on Nike’s board for five years; he is also the chairman of            PayPal Holdings      (PYPL), which is little changed on the news. He previously served as            eBay’s      (EBAY) CEO as well. Donahoe will replace Mark Parker, who has held the corner office since 2006, and has also held the titles of president and chairman of the board since 2016. Parker will become the executive chairman after stepping down as CEO, while continuing to “lead the board of directors and work closely with Donahoe and the senior management team,” according to Nike’s press release.  Looking ahead. While ServiceNow (NOW) is down 10.2% to $205.10 in recent trading, Nike is now up 1.5% to $97, after initially drifting lower on the news. The leadership change is probably bittersweet for Nike: Parker has overseen a period of impressive growth for the company after steering it through the 2007-09 recession, with the stock’s price appreciating more than 500% since 2006 until the present, while the S&P 500 has risen 189% in the same time frame. Still, Nike has been no stranger to controversy recently, and investors may be willing to have a changing of the guard knowing that Parker will remain a guiding force at the company, at least for the near future.

0," Mixed Signals. The three main U.S. stock market indexes were slightly lower Wednesday, but weren’t straying too far from the break-even line. Data showed U.S. retail sales slumped in September, but earnings season continued its robust start with            Bank of Americareporting better-than-expected profits. China warned the U.S. it would retaliate if a pro-Hong Kong bill that passed the House became law, adding to investor skepticism of a trade-talk breakthrough. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was down just 0.1%. The        S&P 500      was down 0.2% and the         Nasdaq Composite      fell 0.4%.

All Rights ReservedSlack Technologies,ServiceNow,      and a number of other enterprise software stocks are trading sharply lower Wednesday after cautionary comments from Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss on growth rates and valuations in the group.On Slack (ticker: WORK), Weiss slashed his target price to $28 from $38, maintaining an Equal Weight rating, and cautioned that growing competition and other factors will likely limit the multiple investors will pay for the stock.On ServiceNow (NOW), Weiss cut his rating to Equal Weight from Overweight after a year-to-date gain of more than 50%, citing risks in a chief financial officer transition and tough coming earnings comparisons, among other factors.Although Weiss trimmed his price targets on a host of high-multiple software stocks, he issued a separate, more detailed analysis of Slack, and the market is obviously taking his cautionary take to heart. “Mixed Q2 results, increasing competition, weakening IT spending environment and mixed commentary from management around ‘funnel conversion issues’ likely limits the multiple paid for WORK,” he writes.  Barron’s wants to know your thoughts on the market, the economy, and the political landscape. Results will be published at the end of October along with results of our fall 2019 Big Money Poll of institutional investors. Take the Barron’s reader poll here.On the competitive front, Weiss points to a recent Morgan Stanley survey of chief information officers that finds Slack’s position weakening versus Microsoft Teams. The survey also found growing interest and an improving competitive position for Google Hangouts. He also notes that Facebook Workplace now has 3 million paying business customers, a significant total compared with Slack at more than 6 million paid seats and 12 million daily active users, and            Microsoft      (MSFT) with 13 million daily actives. Read more: Sky-High Software Stocks Are Beginning to Look Like They’re Forming a Bubble As for the “conversion” issue Weiss mentions, he writes that Slack has said there are some issues in the conversion of potential users to paying customers. “Even though individuals are still going to the website and signing up (resulting in solid increase in free users) there is a slowdown in the number of those free users who are setting up their teams and starting to engage with the platform,” he writes.Weiss notes that through yesterday, Slack shares had dropped 20% since before second-quarter earnings and are off 36% from the closing price on the day the company started trading in June. He still thinks there’s a huge opportunity for Slack, as the pioneer in “an under-penetrated market opportunity,” which he estimates to be $30 billion or more. While he warns that competition from Microsoft Teams in particular will limit Slack’s “realizable” total addressable market, he also thinks the company can sustain 35%-plus revenue growth through 2024. His issues on Slack boil down to valuation. “We do not think Slack will benefit from expanding multiples, so upside from current levels will come from more gradual outperformance over time,” he writes.As noted, Weiss does a deep dive on software multiple compression in a separate note, asking rhetorically if the sharp pullback in enterprise software valuations offers a buying opportunity in the group. Weiss advises against bottom-fishing, warning that there is still risk in “high multiple names.”“Despite solid secular demand trends behind software and generally solid Q2 results, software stocks have pulled back 23% on average from the 52-week highs,” he writes. “With a combination of high growth software multiples at historical peaks and heavy institutional ownership of the names, prices proved difficult to sustain against a volatile macro environment and sector rotations away from momentum names.”So is it time to buy? Nope, he says. Weiss notes that many stocks still trade at sales multiples above historical averages, with stocks still up 27% year to date on average despite the pullback. He also says the company’s CIO survey finds “a steep deceleration in software spending growth into 2020,” and he cautious that many companies face “difficult comps” in the second half of the year. “We see unfavorable risk/rewards for a lot of the high fliers in software,” he writes. Weiss does find some stocks attractive, including those in the “growth at a reasonable price” category, like            Adobe      (ADBE) and Microsoft. But he cut price targets today on a host of names, including            MongoDB      (MDB),            PagerDuty      (PD),            LiveRamp Holdings      (RAMP),            VMware      (VMW),            Workiva      (WK), and            Yext      (YEXT).Slack shares were down 7.1%, to $22.98, in recent trading, and ServiceNow was down 7.7%, to $124.51. All of the other names Weiss called out were down as well, with MongoDB off 7.8%, to $10.53; PagerDuty off 1.8%, to $26.93; LiveRamp off 0.1%, to $39.99; VMwre down 2%, to $151.96; Workiva down 5.5%, to $42.70; and Yext down 3.7%, to $14.85.

0,"When should you buy shares of            ServiceNow      ? Possibly, right now.ServiceNow stock (ticker: NOW) was trading higher Wednesday after Stifel analyst Tom Roderick raised his rating on the provider of software for IT service management to Buy from Hold. He increased his target for the stock’s price to $320, from $290.Haven’t heard of ServiceNow? Too bad. As Roderick points out, anyone who invested in the company’s June 2012 initial public offering at $18 a share and simply held on would have a return of more than 1,300%, versus 115% for the        S&P 500      over that span. Recently, though, some investors have become jittery. As of the close of trading on Tuesday, the stock was down 16% since July 11. But Roderick says that a round of checks with ServiceNow customers indicates that the business continues to thrive even in the face of a more challenging macroeconomic environment. “We see no good reason why we should remain on the sidelines,” he wrote.Roderick says that his discussions with customers showed “fundamental enthusiasm” over the company’s ability to improve how IT departments operate. That is in contrast to investor concerns that bookings in the third quarter were light. “ServiceNow is like a drug,” he quoted one of the company’s U.S. business partners as saying. “Once you are hooked on the capabilities, you constantly look for ways to expand the use cases. Once you have it implemented, there is no limit to extension on workflows that customers can use.” He quoted another partner as saying that “U.S. business is speeding up. Both with installed customers and net new.”Roderick echoed that idea, writing that ServiceNow has plenty of room to increase its share of spending by existing customers. “Many companies have ripped out their old on-prem ticketing and alerting software over the past several years...but the long-term value…is to automate and integrate all of the IT systems with non-IT systems of record to improve work flows and enable visibility and automation,” he wrote.In Roderick’s view, the time to buy the stock is as soon as possible.“There’s only so long you can sit outside a party, watching everyone else having fund and wondering what it’s like in the party,” wrote Roderick, who clearly likes a good party. “In the face of some recent fundamental uncertainty and a CFO transition that has left other investors nervous, we’ll happily join the festivities while offering our two cents: we don’t think the business is slowing in a way that some investors fear.”The stock was up $8.77, or 3.4%, to $264.05.

All Rights ReservedIt’s always a little dangerous for analysts to do a sum-of-the-parts analysis. The approach leads to speculation of theoretical transactions that aren’t likely to happen. What would Amazon Web Services be worth as a stand-alone business? Or how much would the Apple App Store be worth on its own? And what if News Corp. spun off Barron’s? Piper Jaffray analyst James Fish Tuesday unveiled a detailed analysis on            Cisco Systems       (ticker: CSCO), and found—surprise!—that the parts are worth more than the whole. His base case found $244 billion in value at Cisco, which would be about $57 a share, suggesting nearly 20% upside for the stock. His calculation includes $101 billion for infrastructure platforms, $47 billion for applications, $37 billion for security, and another $50 billion for other stuff. The infrastructure calculation reflects $25 billion for campus switching, $40 billion for data-center switching and routing, $13 billion for software-defined wide-area networking, $18 billion for wireless, and $4.5 billion for servers and hyperconverged infrastructure. For applications, he counts $27 billion for collaboration software and $17 billion for AppDynamics, which Cisco bought in 2017 for what now appears to be a bargain price of $3.9 billion.Fish is quick to note that he is not advocating for a Cisco split up but instead asserts that the analysis supports a higher valuation for the stock and that recent multiple expansion is likely to continue as long as the “growth” segments can execute. He finds good risk-reward in the shares with the stock at the low end of his sum-of-the-parts range, which goes from $43 to $70. Fish has an Overweight rating on Cisco stock with a $55 target price.Fish also uses his note to engage in some speculation on potential M&A targets for the always-acquisitive networking giant. His list of potential deals is long, but he singles out companies as the best ideas for an “elephant-sized deal,” including            Splunk       (SPLK);            PagerDuty      (PD);            ServiceNow       (NOW); “an edge compute vendor” like            Akamai       (AKAM), Cloudflare (which just filed for an IPO), or            Fastly       (FSLY);            Sailpoint       (SAIL); privately held Exabeam, and            Nutanix      (NTNX).

1,"It is usually a good sign when a stock is loved by many fund managers, but sometimes investors get worried about so-called “crowding.”When a stock becomes very popular among investors, the price can be bid up beyond its actual value, making it vulnerable to any negative event in the market if everyone wanted to get out at the same time.Still, investors should be more well off if they follow the “wisdom of the crowd” instead of going against it, according to a Goldman Sachs report issued on Monday.Statistically, concentrated ownership among fund managers has generally been a positive signal for subsequent stock returns, according to the report. Since 2009, the top 20% of stocks with the highest number of hedge fund owners have outperformed the least popular quintile in 65% of quarters during the 3 months following the position filings, with an average excess return of 0.9 percentage point. The same pattern is reflected in mutual funds’ most-popular positions. Since 2013, the top 20% of stocks with highest overweight in large-cap mutual funds have outperformed the bottom quintile by an average excess return of 0.67 percentage point. The shared favorites for both hedge funds and mutual funds have shined even brighter, generating an annualized return of 19% since 2013, while the        S&P 500      returned 13%.That being said, the popular names are still more susceptible to a risk-off environment and falling market in the short term. Since 2013, the group underperformed the S&P 500 about 56% of the time during weeks when the broader market went down, while they outperformed 60% of the time when market climbed. The 12 most-popular stocks among both hedge funds and mutual funds in the first quarter were:            Adobe       (ticker: ADBE),            Booking Holdings      (BKNG),            Citigroup       (C),            Comcast       (CMCSA),            salesforce.com      (CRM),            Delta Air Lines      (DAL),            Alphabet       (GOOGL),            Mastercard       (MA),            ServiceNow       (NOW), PayPal Holdings (PYPL),            UnitedHealth Group       (UNH), and            Visa       (V). It’s worth noting that Alphabet is the only stock that has been a shared favorite in every quarter during the past five years. The popular basket trades at a median price-to-earnings ratio of 26 times, much higher than S&P 500’s 16 times.

During his self-imposed time out, Donahoe shadowed Van Morrison across the U.S. and Europe as a “glorified groupie,” and took a life-altering 10-day silent meditation retreat in Marin, Calif.“We’re at a stage in our life where shame on us for not focusing on important things,” says Donahoe, 58, a self-described extrovert who has grown more introspective with meditation. “The path to happiness is inner health.”ServiceNow is on a path to fulfill its investors. ServiceNow stock has tripled since January 2016 to nearly $200, and one analyst predicts it’s on the fast track to $10 billion in revenue in several years.ServiceNow is soaring on the “massive tailwind” of the cloud, Donahoe says. With            Salesforce.com      (CRM),            Workday (WDAY),      and other software vendors it is leading a digital revolution across businesses that is “hiding all the complexity of work,” Donahoe says.The laid-back Donahoe may have taken a circuitous route along the way, but his resume reads like something straight out of CEO central casting: Ivy League- and Stanford University Graduate School of Business grad who cut his teeth at Bain & Co. for 23 years, rising to CEO in 1999. A little over a decade at eBay, most of it as CEO, where he succeeded Meg Whitman and doubled the company’s revenue to $18 billion. And now CEO at ServiceNow for nearly two years, where he’s overseen the surge in the company’s stock.The Silicon Valley-based company is scheduled to release financial results for its December quarter after U.S. markets close Jan. 30. Analysts expect earnings of 63 cents per share on revenue of $718 million, according to a consensus of analysts polled by FactSet. For the year, they anticipate about $2.6 billion in revenue.Of 35 analysts who cover the company, 29 have Buy ratings, five are at Hold, and one stands at Sell. Their mean target price of $212.84 implies 12% upside to ServiceNow’s Wednesday closing price of $189.59.Donahoe has “done a really nice job helping position ServiceNow as an enterprise workflow platform in the eyes of executives and partners, and broadening the message beyond just the IT department,” Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne told Barron’s in an email. He has an Outperform rating and target price of $230 for ServiceNow.Materne believes ServiceNow isn’t merely in position to reach its publicly stated goal of $4 billion in revenue by the end of 2020, but could soar to more than $10 billion by 2025. The market is clearly for the picking, says Materne, who estimates 30% of ServiceNow’s new business is replacing spreadsheets and other manual processes.Donahoe, who has parlayed his C-suite experience at Bain and eBay into 600 to 700 meetings with customers in the last two years, says the message he gets from major corporations is always the same. “No one said they could afford to skip the digital transformation.”Some of the country’s largest companies–            FedEx (FDX),Walmart      (WMT), and            JPMorgan Chase      (JPM), to name a few–are relying heavily on ServiceNow to make that change.Companies are mixing and matching complementary products from ServiceNow, Salesforce, Workday, and others to ramp up their shift to the cloud, Andrew Wilson, chief information officer of Accenture (ACN), told Barron’s over the phone.“They are a cloud accelerator,” says Wilson, who oversees 500,000 users worldwide, a vast majority of which use the cloud. Donahoe says, “Technology is complicated and frustrating, and it shouldn’t be. Let me show you something.”He interrupts the interview to pop out of his seat, comes from around his desk, and runs a quick demo of a ServiceNow app on his phone that accommodates new employees. The app is sleek and easy to use. These are the types of tasks ServiceNow can handle, he says. An estimated 30% to 40% of the workday is squandered on administrative, redundant, and low-value tasks, according to an internal ServiceNow survey.Donahoe has “accelerated diversification” of ServiceNow’s business model from a single-product company for IT services to a true services platform across an enterprise’s global operations, Sarah Hindlian, head of software research at Macquarie Securities, tells Barron’s in a phone interview. ServiceNow is Hindlian’s top pick, with an Outperform rating and a target price of $215, raised from $210 in September.ServiceNow’s success isn’t surprising to Donahoe’s eBay successor, Meg Whitman, who sees the same transformative qualities that propelled the online marketplace.“John is a tremendous leader who understands the value of culture and the importance of having the right people, in the right jobs, at the right time,” Whitman tells Barron’s in an email. “He took eBay to new heights after he took the reins and has continued that success at ServiceNow.” Write to Jon Swartz at jonathan.swartz@dowjones.comFrom personal transformation to digital transformation.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"As the coronavirus spreads beyond China, Italy and South Korea are focal points for investors worried about the growing scope of the outbreak. Barron’s dug into U.S.-listed companies with exposure to those two countries.We looked at all stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges and trade at least 100,000 shares a day, on average. Of those stocks, four were companies that generated at least 10% of 2019 revenue from Italy, where at least 322 people had been confirmed to have contracted the virus and 10 have died as of Tuesday afternoon.  Barron’s found 18 U.S.-listed companies that get at least 10% of revenue from South Korea, where the World Health Organization counts 763 cases and 7 deaths. (The virus is also spreading in Iran, but sanctions limit U.S. companies’ activity there).Here is a look at the U.S. companies most exposed to Italy and South Korea. ITALY  International Game Technology      (ticker: IGT)  The electronic-gaming equipment and software maker, based in London, gets more than a third of its revenue (37.6%) from Italy. Since the start of the year, the stock has tumbled 18%. Much of that decline came this week, as global indexes slid on virus fears. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.86. For reference, the        S&P 500       has a P/E of 20.8. Dana       (DAN)  This Ohio-based company makes power-conveyance and energy-management solutions for vehicles. About 14% of its sales come from Italy. Like IGT, Dana has dropped 18% since the beginning of January. It is trading at 5.2 times earnings.  Guess       (GES)  Italy accounts for 12% of revenue for the apparel company. The stock has fallen 17% this year. With a P/E of 15.9, it is still relatively expensive compared with other U.S. stocks exposed to Italy.  CNH Industrial      (CNHI)  The agricultural-equipment and commercial-vehicle maker, based in London, derives 11% of total sales from Italy. The stock was up slightly on Tuesday amid a sea of red, but it is still down 20% since the start of January. CNH is trading at a P/E of 8.8.  SOUTH KOREA  Universal Display      (OLED)  The maker of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), based in New Jersey, gets 62% of its revenue from Korea. Investors have taken the stock—which gained 126% in 2019—lower by 25% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 53.9. Xperi       (XPER)  For the San Jose semiconductor company, South Korea accounts for 52% of sales. The stock has fallen 3% since the start of 2020, a loss that appears contained in part because it has given up 26% over the past 12 months.  Onto Innovation      (ONTO)  The chip company, based in Massachusetts, gets a third of its revenue from South Korea. The stock has dropped 8% this year but is holding on to a 14% gain over the past 12 months. It is trading at 63.4 times earnings.  MagnaChip Semiconductor      (MX)  The Luxembourg-based company also gets about a third of total sales from Korea. Despite a 13% decline this week, shares are up 9% since the start of January.  Photronics      (PLAB)  This one is another chip company, based in Connecticut. It derives 27% of revenue from Korea. The stock has lost 20% this year after gaining 62% in 2019. Its P/E stands at 27.9. Silicon Motion Technology      (SIMO)  This Hong Kong-based chip maker gets a quarter of total revenue from Korea. Its stock has fallen 20% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 20.2. Ceva       (CEVA)  For the Mountain View, Calif.,-based company, 24% of sales come from Korea. Though down 10% this week, this one is up 11% on the year.  Lam Research      (LRCX)  Another California chip maker, Lam derives 23% of sales from Korea. Another highflier in recent years, the stock is down 7% this week. It is holding on to a 0.7% gain for the year and is trading at a P/E of 21.1. Coherent Inc.      (COHR)  The California-based industrial laser company derives 22% of revenue from Korea. The stock is down 21% since the start of the year and is trading at a P/E of 88.9. FormFactor      (FORM)  The semiconductor maker, also based in California, gets a fifth of its revenue from Korea. The stock, still up 40% over the past 12 months, is down 11% since the beginning of the year. Its P/E stands at 45. Nu Skin Enterprises       (NUS)  Based in Provo, Utah, Nu Skin sells personal-care products and nutritional supplements, deriving 14% of its revenue from Korea. Shares have dropped 35% this year, bringing the loss over the past 12 months to 58%. The stock is trading at 8.9 times earnings.  Acushnet Holdings      (GOLF)  For the golf-products maker, which owns the Titleist brand and is based in Massachusetts, Korea makes up 14% of total sales. The stock has declined 16% this year and is trading at a P/E of 18.2. Applied Materials      (AMAT)  The California chip maker derives 13% of revenue from Korea. The stock gained 82% in 2019 and has hung onto most of that gain. Year-to-date, shares are down 3.5%. It trades at a P/E of 19.3. KLA Corp. (KLAC)  KLA is another California semiconductor company, reliant on Korea for 13% of its sales. Shares have declined 16% since January, leaving its gain over the past 12 months at 29%. The stock trades at a P/E of 17.3. eBay Inc.      (EBAY)  For the online auction platform, Korea represents 11% of revenue. The stock has slipped 4% this week but is still up 1.5% on the year, following reports it may sell its classified-ads business for around $10 billion. eBay has a P/E of 14.5. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  This Massachusetts chip company also gets 11% of its revenue from South Korea. Shares are down 12% since the start of the year after gaining 78% in 2019. Skyworks P/E stands at 20.3. Synopsys      (SNPS)  A 10th of this electronic design company’s revenue comes from Korea. The California company’s stock has fallen 5.2% this week but is hanging onto a 1.8% gain for the year. It is trading at 41.4 times earnings. Lumentum Holdings      (LITE)  The optical and photonic product maker, based in California, derives 10% of overall sales from Korea. Shares in the company have fallen 1.1% this year after gaining 53% in 2019. Its P/E stands at 47.03.

All Rights ReservedThe recent market decline due to uncertainty over the coronavirus is providing attractive buying opportunities in the semiconductor sector, according to Wells Fargo Securities. Chip stocks have tumbled, along with equity markets. The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (ticker: SOXX), which tracks the performance of a widely followed semiconductor-sector index, has declined by about 14% over the past month, compared with the 16% drop for the        S&P 500.      Wells Fargo analyst Gary Mobley on Monday reiterated his Overweight ratings for both            Qorvo      (QRVO) and            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS). He noted both chip makers already modestly lowered their financial forecasts due to the coronavirus last week. “Following a recent round of estimate cuts for QRVO & SWKS...we believe next 12 months estimates have been largely de-risked,” he wrote. “We suggest investors buy shares of QRVO & SWKS following the recent sell off.”Qorvo shares were down 4.5% to $90.09, while Skyworks stock declined 6.7% to $89.27 on Monday afternoon. The chip companies make radio-frequency, or RF, semiconductors, which enable smartphones to communicate with wireless networks.The analyst said the two companies are the “best-in-class” ways to play the growth in 5G smartphones as the amount of RF chip content is much higher in 5G phones than in the prior 4G models. He also thinks China may subsidize the cost of 5G handsets to boost demand and help its economy. “We believe wider adoption of 5G...will drive the smartphone industry to transition to more global designs (which uses more expensive RF...solutions),” he wrote.Wall Street analysts are mixed on Qorvo. About 54% have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 46% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet. Views about Skyworks are similar, with 55% at Buy and 42% at Hold.

0,"Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) is the latest tech company to lower its outlook because of coronavirus’ impact on both global supply chains and demand in China. But, for now, the market seems to be looking past the current quarter issues, focusing instead on the longer-term picture.On Wednesday Skyworks (ticker: SWKS), which makes chips used by            Apple      (AAPL) and other mobile phone companies, said it now sees revenue of $760 million to $770 million for its fiscal second quarter ending March 27, down from a previous forecast of $800 million to $820 million. The company trimmed its non-GAAP profit outlook to $1.34 a share at the midpoint of the revenue range, from $1.46. “Although COVID-19 has caused no significant disruption within Skyworks’ manufacturing operations to date, the current demand environment for our products has been negatively impacted by interruptions in global supply chains,” Skyworks COE Liam Griffin said in a statement.Skywork’s revised forecast isn’t a huge surprise, given other recent warnings about Coronavirus’ impact. Apple recently said that it wouldn’t hit its previous March quarter revenue guidance of $63 billion to $67 billion, due to virus-related supply chain and demand issues in China, and there were similar warnings earlier this week from Skyworks’ rival            Qorvo      (QRVO).Here’s a quick look at the growing list of tech companies that have issued warnings for the current quarter:While most of these stocks sold off in recent weeks as the market tumbled on coronavirus fears, the specific announcements had little immediate impact on the stocks—shares of Skyworks are up 3.3% on Wednesday, to $102.88, outpacing the        S&P 500’s      2.7% gain, as of 1:45 p.m. ET. Investors continue to expect supply chain and sales disruptions caused by the coronavirus to be transitory—and that sales lost in the March quarter will mostly be made up in subsequent quarters. In short, the view is that we’re seeing orders delayed, not canceled.  Write to Eric J.

1,"Multiple chip stocks are heading lower Tuesday in the wake of            Apple’s      announcement that its March-quarter revenue will fall short of previous guidance due to the impact of the spreading coronavirus crisis on both contract manufacturing and retail sales in China.Apple (ticker: AAPL) had previously forecast March-quarter revenue of $63 billion to $67 billion but now says it won’t reach that level, and Wall Street estimates are dropping to the $60 billion level or lower. Barclays      analyst Blayne Curtis published a list of component makers Tuesday morning by their revenue exposure to Apple—and most of the names on the list are heading lower. Note, though, that the losses are modest, a reflection of the relatively muted reaction to the announcement on Apple shares. Analysts are cutting their estimates on Apple’s March-quarter results but lifting projections for the June quarter. The widespread view is that the long-term impact on Apple’s business will be minimal.On the other hand, for companies who makes parts for mobile phones, exposure goes beyond Apple and includes both China-based phone makers like Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi and other Android handset makers who rely on Chinese contract manufacturers.Here’s the Barclays list of chip stocks ranked by estimated revenue exposure to Apple:Curtis also ranks chip companies by exposure to Huawei, the leading Chinese mobile-phone manufacturer, and by exposure to non-Huawei Android phone makers like            Samsung Electronics      (005930.Korea):Huawei exposure:Non-Huawei Android phone exposure:In early trading Tuesday, shares of Apple, Micron, Cirrus, Qorvo, Lumentum, and Skyworks were all off more than 2%.

0,"The stock market’s reaction to Coronavirus has been mixed, with some companies that rely on China for customers or supplies falling by double-digits while others have barely shrugged.The virus is likely to reduce economic growth in the first quarter by 2 percentage points globally and 0.4-0.5 points in the U.S., according to            Goldman Sachs      strategists. But Goldman predicts that nearly all of that economic activity will be made up in the second and third quarters, so that there’s barely any net economic impact from the disease. For the full year, U.S. GDP could take a 0.1 to 0.2 point hit, reducing cumulative corporate earnings per share for        S&P 500       companies by 30 to 60 cents. Given that Goldman expects S&P earnings to hit $174 this year, 60 cents is basically chump change.So far, the virus has mostly been contained in China, with nearly 99% of the known cases being recorded there. There’s no guarantee that it won’t begin to spread more aggressively outside the country. For now, investors have mostly treated it like an isolated issue. In China, the death toll hit 910 on Monday morning, surpassing the SARS epidemic. But some analysts see signs that the economy could begin to rebound in February. In fact, some factories that had been shut down could get back to work this week, according to analyst Edward Moya at currency broker OANDA.“Foxconn got approval to resume production in Zhengzhou, the main production point for iPhone 11, with most of the other manufacturing giants all to be poised to back to work within the next couple of weeks,” Moya wrote in a report on Monday. “GM will resume Chinese production on February 15th,            Hyundai Motor      will resume their domestic production tomorrow, both            Sony       &             LG Display       resumed normal operations today, while            Tencent       asked workers to stay at home until February 21st.”That said, businesses had previously predicted they’d restart operations after the Lunar New Year only to be delayed, so these dates could always be pushed back.The Goldman strategists have identified stocks with outsize exposure to China that have fallen the most since investors started to worry about the outbreak. They include            Wynn Resorts      (ticker: WYNN), which makes most of its money in Macau, a gambling resort area in China.            Yum China      (YUMC), which operates KFC and Pizza Hut inside China, has also been hurt. And computer chip maker            Qorvo      (QRVO) makes nearly three quarters of its revenue in China.Other consumer stocks focused on growing sales in China have also been hurt. Both            Royal Caribbean      (RCL) and            Carnival       (CCL) cruise companies are down about 10% since late January.            Starbucks      (SBUX) has closed more than half of its stores in China. Airlines including            Delta       (DAL),            United Airlines      (UAL) and            American Airlines      (AAL) have canceled flights to and from the country. Of those, United has the most exposure to China. Its stock is down 10% this year.Still, the strategists don’t think investors should buy every stock that’s fallen in the hope that the virus will be contained. People should look in particular at cyclical and value stocks, they say. Companies that are growing their dividends have been trailing the market and could rebound on expectations that virus-related declines could reverse. Stocks with growing dividends that are likely to swing on market shifts include            Skyworks       (SWKS),            DXC Technology       (DXC),            Wynn Resorts       (WYNN),            Broadcom      (AVGO), and            Caterpillar      (CAT).

1," 12:36 p.m. Advanced Micro Devices is climbing Monday, and could end the day at an all-time high—despite the risks posed by coronavirus. AMD (ticker: AMD) has jumped 4.5% to $51.99, though there is little news that would seem to be moving the stock. In fact, the only piece is see is an unconfirmed report on Benzinga that its chips could replace            Intel’s      in            Apple’s      (AAPL) iPhone. Intel stock is down 0.4% to $65.74.AMD isn’t the only stock showing strength Monday.            Nvidia      (NVDA) has risen 3.1% to $259.34, while            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) has advanced 1.3% to $114.92.            Broadcom      (AVGO), though, is off 0.9% at $312.25.What about coronavirus? Well, it seems that the market just isnt that worried. Yes, Apple is down after a report raised concerns about the impact of delays at Foxconn on iPhone sales, but just 0.1% to $319.60. So not much worry. And for now, there doesn’t seem to be much worry emanating from the chip makers themselves. “While several chip companies have noted that the coronavirus outbreak creates risk, there has not been any major semiconductor company so far, to our knowledge, that has confirmed any major impact to its business as yet. Memory spot prices appear to be holding fairly steady,” writes Nomura analyst David Wong. “Nevertheless, we continue to think that coronavirus might pose a risk to semiconductor sales in 2020.”Just not yet.

All Rights ReservedU.S. stocks are set to open flat on Monday as investors digest the ongoing threat of the coronavirus. All the benchmark indexes closed at records last week before slipping on Friday as optimism over the virus subsided. Stock futures have fluctuated on Monday as investors work out what to make of the latest developments. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      was set to open slightly lower as futures dipped, along with the        S&P 500      and the        Nasdaq.      Chinese officials reported 97 deaths on Sunday, a new daily record, diminishing hopes that the outbreak was stabilizing. However, a scientific model predicted the number of cases would peak in mid-to-late February.Companies, economists, analysts and investors have been trying to count the cost of the full impact of the virus as it continues to spread.Goldman Sachs analysts said the economic impact will be limited and investors should look to cyclical and value stocks. Goldman analysts said the virus would hit U.S. economic growth by up to 0.5 percentage points in the first quarter, but the drag would be recouped over the next two quarters and the global damage could be as low as 0.1 percentage points over the full year. “The impact of the lower global and U.S. economic activity on 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share will be limited,” Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David Kostin, said in a note.“Investors who believe the economic consequences of the coronavirus will be limited should increase exposure to cyclicals and value stocks,” they said.The bank’s sector-neutral dividend growth basket of 50 stocks has “declined sharply” alongside cyclicals and trades with depressed valuations.“If fears of global pandemic are allayed, the basket should outperform,” they added.The basket’s stocks set to outperform the most are semiconductor company            Skyworks,      IT services provider            DXC,      hotel and casino operator            Wynn Resorts,      technology company            Broadcom      and construction equipment manufacturer            Caterpillar,      the note said.Goldman analysts said barring a “significant change” in circumstances, the impact of coronavirus on U.S. equities would be focused on a select group of companies most exposed to China — including restaurant owner            Yum China      and component manufacturer            Qorvo.When it comes to sectors, airlines and gaming will be the most affected, due to travel restrictions and U.S. casinos operating in Macau — particularly as the Lunar New Year is the most lucrative time for gaming, they added.U.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Skyworks Solutions      shares were losing ground in aftermarket trading Thursday despite the company reporting better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27.For the quarter, the mobile-phone radio-chip company posted revenue of $896.1 million, down from $972 million a year earlier but above Wall Street’s consensus at $880.6 million. Non-GAAP profit was $1.68 a share, 3 cents better than consensus, though down from $1.83.Skyworks (ticker: SWKS) expects current-quarter revenue of $800 million to $820 million, above the Street consensus at $788.4 million, with non-GAAP profit of $1.46 a share, ahead of the Street at $1.40.“Skyworks exceeded December quarter expectations driven by global demand for our high performance connectivity engines,” CEO Liam Griffin said in a statement. “With an expansive suite of applications from smartphones to wireless infrastructure, industrial robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart homes and virtual assistants, our solutions provide the critical connection, ensuring peak performance for 5G and IoT usage cases. At the same time, through crisp operational execution and a strong business model, we are translating these results into long-term shareholder value.”Earlier Thursday, Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman warned investors that Skyworks stock could sell off if the company didn’t deliver a big earnings beat. He said investors have been expecting current-quarter revenue above $850 million. And in fact, there does seem to be some disappointment on the Street with the Skyworks report. The stock was down 2.8% to $124.60 around 5 p.m., after climbing 3.3% in regular trading. Skyworks shares soared 84% in 2019.  Write to Eric J.

0,"Seeing “5G tailwinds” for makers of mobile-phones, Citi analyst Atif Malik this afternoon raised his price targets on two companies.Malik raised the price target on            Skyworks Solutions      stock (ticker: SWKS) to $125 from $98, and raised the price target on            Qorvo      stock (QRVO) to $118 from $98. In both cases, he keeps Neutral ratings, citing concerns about both “long-term China substitution risk at Huawei and concentration risk at            Apple      (AAPL).” Malik says his move comes in response to a positive December quarter earnings announcement Monday from the London-based chip maker            Dialog Semiconductor      (DLGNF).  Dialog Monday announced that revenue for its December quarter would be about $381 million, above the midpoint of its previous guidance range of $350 million to $390 million. Dialog makes mixed-signal chips for power management, Buetooth, backlighting, and various other applications for customers such as Apple, Xioami, Huawei Technologies, and            Samsung.Malik writes that historically, fundamentals at mobile-chip makers like Skyworks and Qovo “correlate decently” with conditions at Dialog. In a note last month, Malik placed Skyworks on Citi’s “catalyst watch list,” anticipating that the stock would outperform over the next few months based on strong holiday sales, the expected Apple SE2 iPhone launch in the first quarter, last week’s CES conference in Las Vegas, and Mobile World Congress next month in Barcelona.Dialog stock rallied 5.2% to $54.80 on Monday. Skyworks stock surged 3.7% to $124.51. Qorvo stock rose 2.1% to $115.74. Write to Eric J.

0,"Everyone loves a comeback story. Especially investors.To identify the stock market’s best 2019 comebacks, Barron’s ranked the companies in the        S&P 500      index by their 2018 and 2019 price changes. We then calculated the difference in the price changes to come up with the best improvements. It’s worth noting that a stock that falls 50% one year, needs to gain 100% in the following year to reach break-even.Lam Research      (ticker: LRCX) topped the list. It soared 117% in 2019, following a 26% decline in 2018, for a delta of 143 percentage points.Chips and chip equipment makers dominate the list of comeback stocks, reflecting what bulls think will be an upturn in memory chip demand starting in 2020. Investors are hoping that 5G wireless services will drive an uptick in mobile phone sales, along with a pickup in chip demand from public cloud companies. Here’s a list of the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with the most dramatic reversals of fortune. (The data reflect the stocks’ closing prices on Dec. 26.) Lam Research (LRCX)  Price change, by year  2018: -26%,  2019: +117%  Lam’s rebound was part of a broad 2019 recovery in companies that make chip manufacturing hardware. Lam expects to see a pickup in spending on memory chip manufacturing in 2020 and beyond, with continued stable demand from logic chip companies and contract chip manufacturers. Over the last two years combined, Lam stock is up 59%.Coty (COTY)  2018: -67%  2019: +67%  In July,            Coty      announced a turnaround plan intended to “drive substantial improvement” in its consumer beauty business while deleveraging and improving profitability. In November, the company announced a deal to buy a 51% stake in Kylie Jenner’s company Kylie Cosmetics for $600 million. Coty is still down 45% over the last two years. Western Digital (WDC)  2018 -54%  2019 +70%  With the 2015 acquisition of SanDisk,            Western Digital      has become a bet on memory chips—with both DRAM and NAND memories expected to show better pricing and improved demand in 2020 and beyond. The stock is down 22% over the last two years.Applied Materials      (AMAT)  2018 -36%  2019 +87%  Like Lam, Applied is benefiting from anticipation of improving demand for chip making gear. On the company’s most recent earnings conference call, CFO Daniel Durn said that “while it’s always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it’s a matter of when, not if.” Shares are up 19% over the last two years.Arconic (ARNC)  2018 -38%  2019 +85%  The specialty metals company, spun off from            Alcoa      (AA) three years ago, rejected a buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in January. Instead, the company has filed with the SEC to split in two, with one company focused on aerospace and the other on autos—a move investors expect to unlock value for shareholders. Arconic shares are up 14% over the last two years.Xerox Holdings      (XRX):  2018 -32%  2019 +90%  Xerox shares have gotten a boost from the company’s aggressive cost-cutting moves, as well as its decision to sell its long held joint venture in Japan with Fujifilm. In recent weeks, the focus has shifted to the company’s bold unsolicited bid for            HP      (HPQ). Xerox is up 28% over the last two years.Fortune Brands Home & Security      (FBHS)  2018 -44%  2019 +72%  Fortune makes cabinets, plumbing supplies, and other home building wares. While the company said in reporting third-quarter results that the market had been slower than expected, it also said that there was a pickup in demand in September and October from both the new construction and home repair markets. Starting in January, President and COO Nicholas Fink becomes CEO, taking over for Christopher Klein, who is retiring. The stock is down 4% over the last two years.KLA (KLAC)  2018 -15%,  2019 +100%  The semiconductor capital equipment firm is seeing good demand from the logic chip sector, and it sees broad trends driving growth in 2020 and beyond. CEO Rick Wallace said on the company’s latest conference call that “the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence growing semiconductor investment in China, and continued device and process innovation.”            KLA      shares are up 69% over the last two years. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  2018 -29%  2019 +82%  Skyworks makes radio chips for mobile phones, which are expected to see accelerating demand in 2020 with the arrival of the first 5G handsets. The stock is up 27% over the last two years.General Electric      (GE)  2018 -57%  2019 +54%  After a disastrous 2018, GE shares are showing signs of life. Investors seem to have gained confidence that GE has gotten a grip on its operating issues. Bulls expect improvements ahead at GE Power, continued solid performance at GE Healthcare, and growth in aircraft leasing. That said, its aircraft engine business remains vulnerable to the continued troubles with            Boeing’s      737 Max aircraft. GE shares are still down 33% over the last two years.

0,"With semiconductor stocks up more than 55% this year, the chip sector is an increasingly tough place for bargain hunters to find opportunity. But Vivek Arya, semiconductor analyst at BofA Securities, has taken up the challenge—in a research note Monday, he offered up six ideas on value-priced chip stocks to buy despite this year’s robust sector rally.Arya divides his list of Buy-rated bargains into three categories: compute, diversified and smartphone.In the “compute” category, he picks            Intel      (INTC) and            Broadcom      (AVGO), both of which have produced returns this year that fell well short of the overall chip sector—Intel is up 24%, Broadcom 29%. Arya writes that “compute” remains his preferred area in semis, with exposure to cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and 5G, which he says should make the group more resilient even in a tougher macro environment.The analyst says            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD) are his favorite picks in this area, but that Intel and Avago are cheaper, trading at multiples of earnings and cash flow well below peers. Arya notes that both companies face competitive and business headwinds, but that both companies have underperformed the SOX semiconductor index for two years running, and “offer catch up potential as secular trends emerge in 2020.”Among diversified chip makers, Arya recommends            NXP Semiconductors       (NXPI) and            ON Semiconductor      (ON). He asserts that thawing of U.S./China trade tensions could boost industrial sector confidence and lift demand for companies that make microcontrollers, discrete components and analog chips. The analyst notes that both companies have appreciated just 5%-6% since the start of 2018, versus 40% for the SOX, and trade at a discount to peers. For NXP, he notes that the company has a $2 billion buyback plan in place, and adds that having its home base in the Netherlands gives it advantages over U.S. companies with China customers. In the smartphone category, his value picks include both            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) and            Qorvo      (QRVO), asserting that 5G wireless could offer “a multi-year investible theme.” He thinks both companies offer “compelling value” given potential for 10%-plus sales growth and 15%-plus EPS growth for the next three years. “While these stocks have done well since their Q3 reports, we note they underperformed for 4 years prior, and that there is substantial upside to earnings with less than 1% 5G penetration in 1.4 billion-plus global smartphones and hundreds of millions of connected Internet of Things devices currently.”On a strong day for chip stocks, all six stocks are trading higher Monday.

1,"With 5G wireless mobile phones on the way, the time has come to buy shares of the key radio component vendors, according to BofA Global Research analyst Vivek Arya.Arya today did a “double upgrade” of both            Skyworks Solutions      (ticker: SWKS) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) to Buy from Underperform. He lifts his price target for Skyworks to $122 from $92, and for Qorvo to $130 from $90. He also repeats a Buy rating on            Broadcom      (AVGO), which he also expects to benefit from the growth in 5G handsets.“In our view, 5G could prove to be one of the more compelling and investible themes in semis, driven by the exponential growth in components required to upgrade ~1.4 billion 4G smartphones and several hundred million IoT Internet of Things devices,” Arya writes in a research note. “Radio Frequency chips will be a critical enabling technology to help monetize expensive spectrum and enhance battery life.” He says the first round of 5G stock investments focused on infrastructure plays, including            Marvell Technology      (MRVL),            Analog Devices      (ADI) and            Xilinx      (XLNX), but that the next phase could also favor RF chip stocks that have underperformed the PHLX Semiconductor Index since 2015.Arya notes that 5G technology should provide 10 times the bandwidth, requiring “highly complex/integrated RF components.” BofA sees $12.6 billion in RF sales this year, with growth accelerating to 14% annually over the next three years, from just 2% over the last three years. He says 5G phone adoption should grow from under 20 million this year to 200 million next year and 450 million in 2021.

1,"As the coronavirus spreads beyond China, Italy and South Korea are focal points for investors worried about the growing scope of the outbreak. Barron’s dug into U.S.-listed companies with exposure to those two countries.We looked at all stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges and trade at least 100,000 shares a day, on average. Of those stocks, four were companies that generated at least 10% of 2019 revenue from Italy, where at least 322 people had been confirmed to have contracted the virus and 10 have died as of Tuesday afternoon.  Barron’s found 18 U.S.-listed companies that get at least 10% of revenue from South Korea, where the World Health Organization counts 763 cases and 7 deaths. (The virus is also spreading in Iran, but sanctions limit U.S. companies’ activity there).Here is a look at the U.S. companies most exposed to Italy and South Korea. ITALY  International Game Technology      (ticker: IGT)  The electronic-gaming equipment and software maker, based in London, gets more than a third of its revenue (37.6%) from Italy. Since the start of the year, the stock has tumbled 18%. Much of that decline came this week, as global indexes slid on virus fears. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.86. For reference, the        S&P 500       has a P/E of 20.8. Dana       (DAN)  This Ohio-based company makes power-conveyance and energy-management solutions for vehicles. About 14% of its sales come from Italy. Like IGT, Dana has dropped 18% since the beginning of January. It is trading at 5.2 times earnings.  Guess       (GES)  Italy accounts for 12% of revenue for the apparel company. The stock has fallen 17% this year. With a P/E of 15.9, it is still relatively expensive compared with other U.S. stocks exposed to Italy.  CNH Industrial      (CNHI)  The agricultural-equipment and commercial-vehicle maker, based in London, derives 11% of total sales from Italy. The stock was up slightly on Tuesday amid a sea of red, but it is still down 20% since the start of January. CNH is trading at a P/E of 8.8.  SOUTH KOREA  Universal Display      (OLED)  The maker of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), based in New Jersey, gets 62% of its revenue from Korea. Investors have taken the stock—which gained 126% in 2019—lower by 25% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 53.9. Xperi       (XPER)  For the San Jose semiconductor company, South Korea accounts for 52% of sales. The stock has fallen 3% since the start of 2020, a loss that appears contained in part because it has given up 26% over the past 12 months.  Onto Innovation      (ONTO)  The chip company, based in Massachusetts, gets a third of its revenue from South Korea. The stock has dropped 8% this year but is holding on to a 14% gain over the past 12 months. It is trading at 63.4 times earnings.  MagnaChip Semiconductor      (MX)  The Luxembourg-based company also gets about a third of total sales from Korea. Despite a 13% decline this week, shares are up 9% since the start of January.  Photronics      (PLAB)  This one is another chip company, based in Connecticut. It derives 27% of revenue from Korea. The stock has lost 20% this year after gaining 62% in 2019. Its P/E stands at 27.9. Silicon Motion Technology      (SIMO)  This Hong Kong-based chip maker gets a quarter of total revenue from Korea. Its stock has fallen 20% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 20.2. Ceva       (CEVA)  For the Mountain View, Calif.,-based company, 24% of sales come from Korea. Though down 10% this week, this one is up 11% on the year.  Lam Research      (LRCX)  Another California chip maker, Lam derives 23% of sales from Korea. Another highflier in recent years, the stock is down 7% this week. It is holding on to a 0.7% gain for the year and is trading at a P/E of 21.1. Coherent Inc.      (COHR)  The California-based industrial laser company derives 22% of revenue from Korea. The stock is down 21% since the start of the year and is trading at a P/E of 88.9. FormFactor      (FORM)  The semiconductor maker, also based in California, gets a fifth of its revenue from Korea. The stock, still up 40% over the past 12 months, is down 11% since the beginning of the year. Its P/E stands at 45. Nu Skin Enterprises       (NUS)  Based in Provo, Utah, Nu Skin sells personal-care products and nutritional supplements, deriving 14% of its revenue from Korea. Shares have dropped 35% this year, bringing the loss over the past 12 months to 58%. The stock is trading at 8.9 times earnings.  Acushnet Holdings      (GOLF)  For the golf-products maker, which owns the Titleist brand and is based in Massachusetts, Korea makes up 14% of total sales. The stock has declined 16% this year and is trading at a P/E of 18.2. Applied Materials      (AMAT)  The California chip maker derives 13% of revenue from Korea.

After the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      rallied 115.27 and the S&P 500 closed at a new high of 3,046.77 on Wednesday, stock futures were pulling back this morning. One reason? Bloomberg Television reported China has doubts it can reach a long-term trade deal with the U.S. More data is ahead—weekly jobless claims and consumer spending—which come on the heels of another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy looks strong enough not to need more cuts in the future. We’ll see.Investors will be reacting to results from those big tech names and wading through more reports, from            DuPont      (ticker: DD),            Clorox      (CLX), and others. Still enthralled by big tech names such as Apple? BlueBox Asset Management’s co-portfolio manager William De Gale who says it’s time for investors to look past that household names toward companies on the cutting edge of the next big technology shift—connecting computers to the real world.“I want to own companies that are going to be dramatically better than five years from today,” the former BlackRock tech fund manager tells MarketWatch in an interview. In the Global Technology Fund he manages, he offers up alternatives like decades-old            Texas Instruments      (TXN). “It makes power management integrated circuits, a very small, very cheap chip that controls the flow around a circuit, and basically allows a battery to last as long as possible,” said De Gale, who adds that Texas Instruments has very little competition. Then there’s            EPAM Systems      (EPAM), a software-services company that made Fortune’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list for 2019. “They write software for companies that can’t do it themselves, mostly working for non-tech companies,” so in a sense a “sophisticated niche business,” he says.Also            Cadence Design Systems      (CDNS), which writes software to help chip designers design chips. De Gale says it stands out among the competition—            Synopsys      (SNPS) and Mentor Graphics, which was acquired in 2016 by            Siemens      (SIE.Germany).

1,"A Trump administration ban on U.S. companies using telecommunications equipment produced by the Chinese tech giant            Huawei,      coming on the heels of a trade war between China and the U.S., is sending shivers through the semiconductor industry.In a report issued Monday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves says semiconductor firms are being affected differently by the Huawei ban and the tariff fight, depending on their focus and exposure, but all bear risks.“We view the Huawei and China/US relationship as a negative overhang on the semiconductor space and a lift of either would likely send the Semiconductor industry materially higher,” Steves writes. “In addition, if the relationship between the US and China worsens, positive earnings results could be quickly offset by another tariff hike.” The back story. Huawei (ticker: 002502.Shenzhen) is among the world’s largest buyers of semiconductors, a key component in electronic devices. A Trump executive order, signed last week, effectively bans the company from doing business inside the U.S. The ban came as faltering talks between the U.S. and China sparked fears of a trade war.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF       (SMH), which tracks the semiconductor industry, had dropped 11.6% from April 24 through Friday. What’s new. In his note, Steves identifies the semiconductor firms that have an exposure to Huawei, and those that are exposed to the trade war.In the Huawei column, Steves places            Analog Devices       (ADI),            Synopsys       (SNPS),            Cadence Design Systems       (CDNS), and a handful of others.Huawei is a major builder of equipment needed for new 5G networks, and the semiconductor firms most at risk, Steves writes, are those with exposure to 5G. Analog Devices, for example, owes 12.5% of its total revenue to 5G, he says.In the China trade war column, Steves places            Advanced Micro Devices       (AMD),            Nvidia       (NVDA), and others, because they are exposed to the risk of new tariffs in a prolonged trade war. Looking ahead.

0,"Trade concerns heightened over the weekend as President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on Chinese imports. U.S. stocks tumbled on the news, but things could deteriorate further, say analysts, especially for this year’s winners—semiconductor stocks. The back story. The U.S. stock market has been rallying this year with both the        S&P 500      and        Dow Jones Industrial Average      reaching new highs not long ago. The optimism and tranquility in the market was partly driven by the wide anticipation of a U.S.-China trade deal by the end of this year, which could boost slowing growth in the world’s two biggest economies. The technology stocks in the S&P 500, especially, have been the best performers, surging over 25% year to date. What’s new. On Sunday afternoon, President Trump took investors by surprise, tweeting that he intends to increase tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, and is also considering placing 25% tariffs on another $325 billion worth of goods that aren’t currently affected by the tariffs. Later Sunday evening, Chinese negotiators were reportedly considering delaying the trade talks scheduled for this week in Washington.S&P 500, Dow and        Nasdaq Composite       futures all fell sharply on the news, and remain down in trading Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently down 245.36 points, or 0.9%, to 26,259.59, while the S&P 500 has tumbled 30.27 points, or 1.0%, to 2,915.37 and the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 99.79 points, or 1.2%, to 8,064.20.Any additional tariffs—and higher raw material input costs as a result—could spark downward revisions to earnings expectations, wrote Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, as “corporate management teams and the sell-side community have only baked in the current tariff regime to guidance and stock level forecasts.”But the re-escalation in trade tensions might “have a greater price impact than fundamentals may indicate,” according to            Morgan Stanley      strategist Michael Zezas. The latest developments come at a “tricky time,” wrote Calvasina, as the current market condition is especially vulnerable to bad news due to investors’ excess euphoria and overvaluation.Calvasina noted some “eerie similarities” between the current conditions and those preceding the S&P 500’s peaks in January and September last year. In the futures market, net longs had crossed above 2010-2014 highs to approach the peaks in late January and late September 2018. As of early May, retail investor sentiment suggests that the percentage of bears has fallen back down to January 2018 lows. RBC’s model capturing 17 valuation metrics for the S&P 500 has also returned to levels that preceded both of 2018’s major market peaks in January and September.What’s more, as Calvasina pointed out, this year’s winning stocks have already started to show signs of fatigue. The best performing stocks in the S&P 500 during the first quarter of 2019 have been flat over the past few weeks. Calvasina thinks the S&P 500’s short-term peak might come sooner than anticipated and recommends investors sell and take away the profits while they still can, particularly in areas that have been helped by the improved outlook for trade. It might also be time to add some defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities, wrote Calvasina. Looking ahead. A delay or even cancelation of the deal with China is particularly negative for industrial and semiconductor stocks, wrote Calvasina. Both sectors have outperformed strongly this year partly due to the improved outlook on trade.RBC analyst Mitch Steves sees major concerns for GPU producers such as Advanced Micro Devices (ticker: AMD) and            Nvidia      (NVDA). If the trade tensions escalate, he wrote, the U.S. might prevent shipments of semiconductors to China, or tax them heavily.The manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment, such as            Lam Research Corp      oration (LRCX),            Applied Materials      (AMAT), and            ASML Holding      (ASML), are also susceptible to trade-related volatility given that “the large products would be easily traceable and taxable,” wrote Steves.One safer space might be the electronic design automation software, or EDA, producers, which only have about 10% of revenue exposed to China and continued to show no slowdown in demand, growth, or profitability, according to Steves.“Despite the volatility in the semiconductor industry, we’ve seen solid results from both            Cadence Design Systems      (CDNS) and            Synopsys      (SNPS) and private start-ups continue to ramp in both the United States and China,” wrote Steves, “We think the number of design starts will remain robust, and as the competition heats up at smaller and smaller nodes (7nm and lower), EDA will become a more important component of the R&D budget.” Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.comTrade concerns heightened over the weekend as President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on Chinese imports.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein disclosed on Friday the first stock transactions of the year made by her husband, Richard Blum.Blum is the founder and head of private-equity firm Blum Capital Partners, and normally a private investor wouldn’t be subject to reporting relatively small changes in his portfolio. However, financial-disclosure laws require the senator and members of her immediate family to disclose transactions valued at $1,000 or more.In January, Blum bought            Nvidia      (ticker: NVDA),            Synopsys      (SNPS), and            FedEx      (FDX) stock, and sold            Hologic      (HOLX) and            3M      (MMM) stock.Feinstein’s office didn’t immediately return a request for comment on the transactions. Blum Capital didn’t respond to a request to make Blum available for comment.For a prior and recent story about Blum’s stock transactions, the senator’s office had written via email that Feinstein “has no involvement whatsoever in her husband’s financial and business decisions aside from the Senate’s routine reporting requirements.”Blum bought $250,001 to $500,000 of Nvidia stock on Jan. 10. Regulatory forms only require ranges, not specific transaction values. The chip maker’s stock was crunched in 2018, losing a third of its value, but its fortunes have changed in the new year. Blum bought on a day that ended with Nvidia shares sporting a year-to-date gain of 8.8%. They’ve continued to gain, and as of early afternoon trading Tuesday, Nvidia stock is up 18% so far in 2019. Barron’s reported that some analysts think Nvidia’s sales target looks too optimistic.Feinstein’s husband also bought $250,001 to $500,000 of Synopsys stock on Jan. 10, which now looks like a particularly savvy purchase. Synopsys, a maker of chip-design software, had a nearly flat 2018, with shares slipping a little more than 1%. They began to heat up in 2019, however, and Blum bought Synopsys stock on a day it closed with a year-to-date gain of 4.2%. They are now up nearly 21% this year. We noted in January that a member of the Barron’s Roundtable recommended Synopsis.Blum bought $50,001 to $100,000 of FedEx stock on Jan. 29. The shipper’s shares took a pounding in 2018, losing more than a third of their market value, and disappointing guidance in December sealed the stock’s fate for the year. Like Nvidia, however, the new year has changed FedEx’s fortunes. Blum bought FedEx stock on a day it closed with a 7.6% year-to-date gain. The shares are now up 12% in 2019. There’s been speculation that            Amazon.com      (AMZN) will buy FedEx, but we don’t think that’s likely.Blum sold $501,000-$1,000,000 of Hologic stock on Jan. 10, a day that saw it close with a 3.6% year-to-date gain. The medical-technology firm saw shares slip 4% in 2018, but they are now up nearly 13% in 2019, despite being downgraded early in the year. Barron’s reported that Blum has been selling 3M stock of late. He sold another $501,000-$1,000,000 of 3M stock on Jan. 10. The maker of Post-its and Scotch tape was caught in a downward trend in 2018 as 3M stock slid 19%. Investors sticking it out, however, have seen 3M stock rise to a 9% gain so far in 2019. The company earlier this month raised its dividend for the 61st consecutive year.

1,"David Dorman , the former chief executive of            AT&T      (ticker: T), is now chairman of a start-up he’s convinced can make history of its own.He believes Infoworks, a Silicon Valley-based software maker that helps usher major corporations into the digital age, is the rare tech company at the intersection of the “right place, right time, right technology,” as he puts it.The company named Dorman—chairman of CVS Health (ticker: CVS) and a board member of Dell Technologies (DELL) and            PayPal Holdings      (PYPL)—to the job on Thursday. “If we execute as a company, we can empower enterprises to organize, manage and utilize data as they strive to compete in the rapidly evolving digital economy,” Dorman told Barron’s in a phone interview. Infoworks’ automation, he adds, allows companies to “achieve analytics agility without hiring armies of big data specialists.”That could be a critical contribution. If the past 10 years saw the rise of mobile devices, the next decade could be defined by whether companies can tap and analyze data through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other developing technologies.            Salesforce.com      (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff has called it the Fourth Industrial Revolution.The market is so broad and filled with competing vendors, it is hard to put a monetary figure on its size, says Ben Bloom, a marketing technology analyst at Gartner. He points to two compelling figures: 83% of firms say they rely on customer data to make decisions, and through June 2018, venture capitalists had poured $600 million into digital-transformation companies.It’s clear there’s a consensus that the shift is critical.If companies don’t act, as former            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) CEO John Chambers recently told Barron’s, they’re toast. He predicts 40% of large companies will go out of business because they can’t keep pace during the digital transformation. So far, digital-transformation efforts aren’t up to speed, according to a report from Dell. Some 78% of 4,600 business leaders polled worldwide said things are proceeding too slowly, and a majority think that could lead to serious trouble in meeting customer demands within five years.Tech veterans like Chambers and Dorman, who served seven years as AT&T CEO until 2006, have put money into companies aiming to facilitate the shift.Dorman has not disclosed his investment in Infoworks, which is a private company, but as chairman and an owner, he expects to be hands on. One of his tasks will be spreading the word about what Infoworks does to companies other than existing customers such as the Hearst media organization. The Palo Alto, Calif., company announced separately that Buno Pati, who was executive chairman, has been appointed as CEO. Co-founder Amar Arsikere moves from CEO to chief product officer and chief technology officer.“Dave deeply understands technology and the need by large companies to make that transition to digital technology, says Pati, a former associate professor at Harvard University. He sold his first company, the semiconductor-technology company Numerical Technologies, to            Synopsys      for $250 million in 2003.“The big question is, can a young company serve these Goliaths to help make the digital transition?” Pati told Barron’s in a phone interview. “I know we can.” Write to Jon Swartz at jonathan.swartz@dowjones.comDavid Dorman , the former chief executive of AT&amp;T (ticker: T), is now chairman of a start-up he’s convinced can make history of its own.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"The Wuhan coronavirus has infected nearly 10,000 people in China and killed 213. To contain the outbreak, national holidays were extended, stores were closed, public events were canceled, and travel plans and movie screenings were delayed. The economic repercussions can’t be ignored, and are reflected in the falling stock prices around global markets. Stock markets in China were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, but trading in exchange-traded funds continued.        iShares MSCI China      (ticker: MCHI) has declined 11% since Jan. 17, while        iShares MSCI World      (URTH) and        iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted      (EUSA) have both lost more than 3%.During the SARS epidemic in 2003, China’s gross-domestic-product growth fell to 0.8% in the second quarter of 2003 from 2.9% in the first quarter, before bouncing back to 3.7% in the third quarter. Retail sales fell 4%, and air-passenger traffic plunged by 70%-80% for tourist-heavy economies such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, according to Robert Buckland, an equity strategist at Citigroup. Read Next: Sports Gambling Will Be a Huge Opportunity. Bet on These Stocks. Asian stocks were hit the hardest and continued to sell off in March 2003, even as markets elsewhere recovered. Indeed, Asian equities didn’t bottom out until new cases of infection peaked in late April. Cyclical sectors sold off the most, while defensives held up better. Some of the hardest-hit industries included airlines, hotels, restaurants, and banks.We should see a similar pattern this time. Citigroup economist Li-Gang Liu expects China’s GDP growth to slow down to 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020, and has cut his forecast for the full year to 5.5% from 5.8%. The outbreak is expected to peak in March, Citi strategists estimate, and Asian equity markets are likely to keep falling until there are signs infections are leveling out.Yet a China slowdown this time around will have a much bigger impact on the world economy than during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The Chinese economy made up only 4% of global GDP back then. Now, it is 17%.In the U.S., the coronavirus outbreak comes when stocks have been rallying for most of the past year and hitting new highs. According to a market sentiment indicator from Citigroup chief U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich, the U.S. market has entered euphoric territory and investors should exercise some short-term caution.The stock market was already due for a pause, and the coronavirus has proven to be the catalyst. Some might worry that the latest dip could mark the beginning of the next major bear market, but Citi’s economists think it’s still too early to make the call. Out of the bank’s 18 economic indicators, only five have turned red—the most for the current cycle, but still not enough to make a bearish call.Instead, the coronavirus-triggered selloff might present a good opportunity to buy the dip. Global equities will likely track the growth of earnings to post about a 4% gain in 2020, according to Buckland, and that means any further drop in prices would make expected returns more attractive.Buckland argues that it might be time to hunt for some bargains. His team has put together a list of large-cap developed-markets stocks that generate at least 15% of their sales from China. Stocks in the list, including 25 U.S., 19 European, and 16 Japanese companies, performed strongly in 2019, rallying 36.6% for the year as the MSCI World benchmark gained 25.2%. They have recently underperformed, falling 4.6% since Jan. 17. These stocks could be vulnerable if worries around the coronavirus and Chinese economy escalate, and should remain under pressure until the outbreak is brought under control. That makes them a good buy. Many of the listed names are in the semiconductors, autos, and tech hardware sector, including            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Intel      (INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            TE Connectivity      (TEL), and            Western Digital      (WDC).

0,"TE Connectivity      just reported earnings per share that beat guidance and Wall Street estimates. That’s good news for investors. And management said it saw solid results across all of its businesses. More good news.The sensors and connectors company reported results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2020—which corresponds to the calendar fourth quarter of 2019—on Wednesday morning. It was a tough year for much of the industrial sector, and companies like TE Connectivity (ticker: TEL), as industrial activity contracted in the U.S. and China. Companies up and down the industrial supply chain held back on orders as trade-war uncertainty weighed on confidence.That environment meant that TE’s sales dropped 5% from the same period a year ago, to $3.2 billion, while adjusted EPS slipped 6%, to $1.21. (Adjustments include accounting for a noncash charge due to tax reform in Switzerland, where the company is based.) But both were better than analysts’ forecasts and the midpoint of company guidance.“When you look at our first quarter, it was a strong quarter across our businesses,” TE Connectivity CEO Terrence Curtin told Barron’s. “I’m very pleased with the execution.... It was really an operational beat, it wasn’t due to tax or things like that.”Some headwinds remain for 2020. The coronavirus outbreak in central China along with            Boeing’s      (BA) 737 MAX turmoil threaten 2020 earnings growth. Still, TE felt confident enough to raise 2020 guidance by a nickel, to about $5.10 a share. Even more good news. And orders grew year over year. The reported book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1, which means the company is recording more new business than current sales.The one negative in the earnings release may have come from something beyond the company’s control: Wall Street. Analysts predict TE will earn $5.12 in 2020. Street estimates and the company’s new guidance are close. But TE is in an unusual situation where Wall Street is more aggressive than the company. That could create volatility for the stock Wednesday. Still, results for the reported quarter look solid. TE’s stability and higher guidance are small positives for the entire industrial sector. “We liked what we saw in a constructive backdrop of stability, versus what has been an ongoing challenging environment,” Curtin told Barron’s. “As we went through the quarter, orders picked up across all regions. And it really gave us increased confidence to where we guided 90 days ago.”Not everything is positive. Boeing and its troubled 737 MAX jet remain a headwind for the company. Curtin told Barron’s the MAX is hitting the company’s sales outlook: “737 platform growth is a 0.5% headwind.” But it didn’t upend full-year guidance because TE is diversified. Total aerospace sales last quarter totaled about $1.2 billion, a little less than 10% of total company sales. That’s split between commercial aerospace and defense markets. What’s more, the commercial aerospace portion is split between Boeing,            Airbus      (AIR.France), and other suppliers. The MAX has been grounded worldwide since mid-March, following two deadly crashes of the single-aisle jet within five months. Boeing has been working on fixes with global aviation authorities for months and temporarily halted MAX production in January, in part to stop building inventory. About 400 planes have been produced and parked since the grounding. The halt has created a lot of uncertainty for all aerospace suppliers.It hasn’t affected stock prices, though. Most suppliers, like TE, are diversified. The aerospace suppliers Barron’s tracks are up about 22% since the second MAX crash, better than the comparable gains of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      and        S&P 500      over the same span. Over the past year, TE stock is up about 22%, closely mirroring gains of the broader stock market. Shares closed Tuesday up 1.3%, at $98.10.

1,"“Brake!” scolds a big orange display in the middle of my dashboard a few times a week, making a routine bend in the road a moment of white-knuckle panic. One time, the brakes engaged with no trouble in sight. The manufacturer calls this computerized incontinence facilitator a “collision mitigation system.” I’d like to sneak up on the CEO a few times a week and set off an air horn, then tell him I’m still working out the kinks on my management salutation system. Stock investors should nonetheless look for exposure to semiconductors in cars. That includes people who are scared to chase soaring            Tesla      (ticker: TSLA) and too impatient for            General Motors (GM)      and its Cruise division. It turns out my car brand scored poorly in a recent Consumer Reports survey on robo-braking systems, but others did better, and 69% of respondents said they were “very satisfied.” Technically, my car can drive itself on highways, too, although it won’t let me recline the seat, put both hands on a pastrami sandwich, and blast Carrie Underwood’s “Jesus, Take the Wheel,” as I feel I deserve.That’s because it is a 2018 model, with mere Level 1 autonomous driving features, as they’re called. Later this year, when I’m in the market again, the company will roll out the same model in a Level 3, which will allow for a modified pastrami-Underwood. It will drive itself in slow-moving traffic, but while drivers may let go of the wheel, they must remain alert and ready to take over. On Tuesday, the Cruise division of General Motors introduced a robotaxi with no steering wheel, called Origin. Passengers sit facing each other, prom-limo-style. To my eye, the vehicle appears to have two rears and zero fronts. Time to buy GM? I’ve honked about those stalled shares so many times I’m at risk of losing my automotive stock-picking license. Turn sweet on Tesla instead? Barron’s Roundtable member James Anderson said this month that the stock, which has multiplied more than tenfold in price over the past seven years, to a recent $543, could one day be worth $5,000. We’ll see.I’ll shift gears to car chips instead. Nearly five years ago I recommended a spinoff of German conglomerate            Siemens,      called            Infineon      (IFX. Germany), for its exposure to car electrification—both electric drive systems and automation. It has returned 117% since then, versus 85% for the S&P 500 index and 32% for Germany’s DAX index.On Jan. 15, Bank of America published a report predicting car semiconductor companies will outperform the market over the next three years. Its reasoning: The gradual uptake of electric and sort-of autonomous vehicles will push semiconductor spending higher. Currently, spending on semiconductors for electric propulsion works out to $37 for every car sold, while chips for driver-assist systems comes to $66. Those figures are projected to hit $74 and $136, respectively, by 2022.That means semiconductor companies can prosper in cars even if the world isn’t buying more of them. Just the same, J.P. Morgan on Tuesday predicted that after two years of declines, global car production would stabilize this year and recover in coming years. BofA says to buy            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI) and            ON Semiconductor      (ON) in the U.S., which are cheaper than the broad market, and in Europe, Infineon and            STMicroelectronics      (STM. France), which are more expensive than the market. J.P. Morgan on Tuesday upgraded shares of            TE Connectivity      (TEL), a U.S. maker of sensors and such, for its exposure to electric and autonomous vehicles. It goes for 19 times forward earnings, with double-digit earnings growth projected over the next few years. I brake for valuations like that. Until I get a car with smarter sensors and chips, of course, I brake for just about everything.

0,"The car business is struggling. Light vehicle sales are falling and new tariffs threaten to raise the price of new and used cars everywhere. Investors already know this. Shares of auto makers around the world trade for less than seven times earnings and the Russell 3000 Auto & Auto Parts Index has returned 2.5% for the past three years, worse than the 16% return of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      That doesn’t faze Baird automotive analyst David Leiker. He sees the auto industry glass as half full, pointing out that first-quarter industry sales and earnings were OK despite all the headwinds. Investors would be wise to note the better financial performance in today’s down market, keeping a couple of automotive stocks on their radar in preparation for better times ahead. “Global production declines of 7% during the first quarter are consistent with historical performance during recessions,” writes Leiker in a Thursday research report. “And in the context of a recessionary environment, underlying results from auto suppliers fared better than what we believe many investors have come to expect.” Industry sales declined and profit margins narrowed in the first quarter, but less than Leiker feared. Cost cuts and other restructuring moves by auto makers and parts suppliers since the financial crisis look like they’re yielding results. The electronics-parts category held up the best. That’s because auto makers are adding more electronics to cars. Electronics revenue can stay flat even when car production drops.            Aptiv      (ticker: APTV) and            TE Connectivity      (TEL) are two large suppliers of electronics for the automotive industry. Leiker rates shares of Aptiv a Buy and shares of TE Connectivity Neutral. He see Aptiv hitting $103, up about 35%, and 11% upside in TE stock. Seating revenue fared the worst in the first quarter. That hurts seat-supplier            Adient      (ADNT), whose shares are already down 67% over the past 12 months. Leiker rates Adient stock Neutral with a $24 price target. That price is 29% higher than current levels, but Adient is saddled with debt, and investors don’t like to pay up for stocks without electronic-like content growth stories. First-quarter earnings are in the books, and the global automotive sector looks cheap. Barron’s has recently recommended shares of            General Motors      (GM) and Aptiv. We have made positive comments about TE Connectivity and            Lear      (LEA) as well. Sometimes it is hard to be a contrarian investor and go against prevailing wisdom, but it’s usually a good idea to zig when other investors zag. Just don’t drive like that.

1,"TE Connectivity      may be the biggest industrial company you have never heard of. It is a maker of electrical connectors and sensors whose products end up in almost every car and in countless factories around the world. With a market value of more than $35 billion, including debt, it is one of the U.S.’s largest industrial enterprises.TE Connectivity (ticker: TEL) CEO Terrence Curtin sat down with  Barron’s on Monday to talk about the business. We were impressed, and learned a few things about the state of global demand for cars, as well as other smart technologies that investors should know about. Some highlights follow. TE is a global business, generating about one-third of sales in Asia, so its performance is a powerful indicator. Orders from China grew 9% in the January-March quarter. “Six months ago we said China was slowing,” said Curtin. “Now China business is stabilizing and growing. The inventory correction is behind us.” That’s one bit of good news for investors. Weak Chinese demand has been a concern for everyone. The Chinese manufacturing sector contracted in three of the past four months. One of TE’s businesses makes connectors for fifth-generation telecommunications antennae, and its customers include network-hardware makers such as            Nokia      (NOK) and            Ericsson      (ERIC). The company expects that there will be 150 million 5G subscribers world-wide by 2021. Whether that happens depends on spending by network providers such asAT&T      (T). Revenue in TE’s communication segment fell by 2% last quarter, yet management remains optimistic about the impact of 5G on its business. The company is ready for higher growth. Curtin says that 5G is important for autonomous driving too: Lower data latency and higher transmission capacity will let vehicles talk to one another and with infrastructure. TE believes that so-called level 4 autonomous-driving technology will be ready before governments are ready to accept self-driving cars. Government policy and regulation will be what slows things down. That’s actually good news. If technology exists for self-driving cars, now or in the near future, it would transform a host of companies, including Uber Technologies (UBER). Level 4 autonomous cars would be able to handle all driving tasks, requiring operators to intervene only when warned. “It is important to remember that autonomous driving is all about safety,” says Curtin. “It is about cutting the number of accidents on the roads.” Many global auto makers have big plans for electric vehicles.            Volkswagen      (VOW.Germany), for instance, want to sell 70 new hybrid and plug-in electric models by 2025. Electric cars are still more expensive than gasoline-powered ones, but it will be difficult to slow the shift to battery-powered light vehicles. “It is different this time,” says Curtin, while acknowledging those are often famous last words. “China is the largest car market in the world and the government strongly supports EVs, Europe is moving away from diesel technology and you just can’t hit tightening emissions standards without EV technology.” TE sells two to three times as many parts for an electric car as for a gas-powered car. 5G networks contain 1.5 to 2 times as many TE parts as older networks, so the company stands to benefit as technology changes.Management isn’t sitting still even though automotive production is expected to fall about 5% in 2019. Curtin sees the downturn as a time to manage costs and improve profit margins while waiting for demand to improve.TE Connectivity stock is up 26% year to date, better than the 14% return of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      TE stock trades for 17 times estimated 2019 earnings, in line with its historical average and at a similar level to other large industrial companies.

0,"Industrial-technology providers            Zebra Technologies      and            Cognex      reported earnings Tuesday. Both companies beat Wall Street sales and adjusted earnings-per-share estimates. Topping expectations sounds good on the surface, but both stocks traded significantly lower after reporting results. Zebra stock (ticker: ZBRA) closed down 7% on Tuesday. Cognex stock (CGNX) ended with a 6% loss. And that’s good news in at least one respect. It gives investors a chance to invest in the growing trend of industrial automation at a better price. Of course no one wants their stock portfolio to decline in value, but nothing we heard on either conference call impacts the long-term growth drivers of either business. “We executed well and sales grew 9%,” CEO Anders Gustafsson told Barron’s in a phone interview. “All business lines grew and we increased revenue guidance.” That doesn’t sound like a recipe for a stock decline. Gustafsson went on to add, “Asia was our fastest-growing region and China was up 12% in the first quarter.”That’s the second time in as many days a CEO has told Barron’s that Chinese growth has improved.            TE Connectivity      (TEL) CEO Terrence Curtin told us Chinese orders grew 9% in TE’s first quarter and the worse was passed for that economy. It’s possible that Zebra shares are being dragged down by Cognex, whose stock-price decline is easier to understand. Cognex management forecast second-quarter sales of $195 million–$8 million below, or 4%, what Wall Street was expecting.  Baird analyst Richard Eastman explained in a research report that large consumer-electronics orders don’t repeat each year, creating a 2019 sales headwind, but adds that Cognex is “still well positioned for multiple secular tailwinds and insistent the 2019 weakness not indicative of market share loss.” Cognex supplies vision systems to assemblers of            Apple      (AAPL) iPhones and other consumer-electronics devices.  Barron’s wrote positively about Cognex on Dec. 28 when shares traded for $37.71. Back then industrial shares were down, near 52-week lows and trading for 15 times estimated 2019 earnings, a discount to their historical average. Our Cognex call wasn’t valuation-based. In December, Cognex shares traded at more than 30 times estimated earnings. The stock’s multiple is justified, as the top line has been growing quickly. Cognex sales have grown an average 22% a year for the past three years.Lower growth would be a problem for a stock with a premium valuation multiple, but, while lumpy, the direction of Cognex sales is up. Eastman predicts the company will generate $927 million in 2020 sales, up 17% from this year. Gustafsson doesn’t see a reason for sales growth to decelerate either. And new catalysts for the adoption of industrial-automation technology are emerging. For instance, the            Amazon.com      (AMZN) move to one-day free shipping for Prime customers keeps pressure on retailers to adopt the latest warehouse-automation technology. “Strong competition spurs innovation and everyone has to embrace technology,” explains Gustafsson.Zebra shares have returned almost 50% a year for the last three years, but they still trade at less than 17 times estimated 2019 earnings, in line with other industrial companies. That’s why days like Tuesday can be a good thing for savvy investors. Cognex is more expensive. It trades at 43 times estimated earnings, a big premium to the U.S. industrial sector. But Barron’s still believes Cognex has the leading technology in a growing field. Which stock—be it Zebra, Cognex, or another automation firm—appeals to investors depends on what kind of investors they are. But no matter what mix of growth and margins appeal to an investor, we think the trend toward higher industrial automation warrants a closer look.

All Rights ReservedBerkshire Hathaway, Royal Dutch Shell, Oracle, and Visa could be relatively solid stocks if volatility picks up in global markets.The stocks show up on a list of the least-volatile stocks within global sectors, according to a report out Monday by quantitative analysts at AllianceBernstein. Broad U.S. market indexes that emphasize low volatility now look quite pricey, the report notes. But individual low-volatility stocks globally are more attractively priced, according to the report, which recommends the stocks as a way to protect against a rise in market volatility. Low-volatility stocks in the U.S. trade at about a 20% premium to high-volatility stocks, on average, the report noted. But in global markets, the stocks trade at a discount to high-volatility stocks on a price-to-book basis, and they trade at nearly the same 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiples.  Volatility is low at the moment as a sense of calm pervades the equity landscape. Stocks have been rising for months: The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have both hit record levels, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is to close to a new high, too. And investors appear optimistic that two of the big risk factors for stocks—sharply higher interest rates and a worsening outlook for trade—won’t come to pass. But this may be the calm before the storm. Global economic growth and corporate profit forecasts would need “to maintain their current levels” to keep volatility at today’s levels, and “we don’t think that is likely,” Bernstein’s analysts wrote. The bond market may also be sending a signal that complacency won’t last: Credit quality has been declining, and that could provide an impetus for stock volatility to pick up. Rising volatility doesn’t just mean the market is getting choppy. It is a measure of investors’ fear of the future, and it usually telegraphs weak near-term returns. Historically, when volatility has picked up from exceptionally low levels, the average return over the following 12 months has been zero, according to Bernstein. Moreover, the most-volatile stocks tend to decline the most (partly because they helped fuel the market run-up). So what stocks look appealing? Bernstein compiled a list of the least-volatile stocks in each sector. Theoretically, they should decline less than the sector or market average in a downturn. Bernsein’s list includes:            Walt Disney       (DIS),            Verizon Communications       (VZ),            McDonald’s      (MCD),            Toyota Motor       (TM),            Royal Dutch Shell       (RDS.B),          Bank of China       (3999.HK),            Berkshire Hathaway       (BRK.B),            Merck       (MRK),            Sanofi       (SNY),            GlaxoSmithKline       (GSK),            Waste Management       (WM),            Visa       (V),            TE Connectivity       (TEL),            Oracle       (ORCL), and            Exelon       (EXC).

1," Growth stocks, fueled by the technology sector, are beating the        S&P 500.      But the market is also rewarding companies with a history of consistent growth—firms that have shown an ability to boost earnings at a stable, if not spectacular, rate. Companies in the S&P 500 that screen well for consistent growth gained 17.3% through February of this year, according to a note out Wednesday by BMO Capital Markets. That beat the S&P 500’s 11.5% return. It also edged stocks that screened well for dividend growth (up 11.7%) and “disciplined value” (up 15%).Consistent growth can mean different things, depending on how you measure it. BMO says it looks for S&P 500 stocks that combine “attractive growth” and consistency, along with “reasonable valuation levels.” The firm screens for five-year returns on equity greater than the S&P 500 and a price-to-earnings-growth ratio below the market average. BMO also screens for profit margins and earning per share stability that both exceed the market average.A total of 31 stocks pass all the tests. About a third are in the tech sector, helping the overall group outperform. They include            Adobe      (ticker: ADBE),            Arista Networks      (ANET),            Oracle      (ORCL), and            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS), all of which are beating the market this year. Not all of BMO’s consistent-growth tech stocks are holding up this year, though. Chip maker            Broadcom      (AVGO) and electronics components supplier            TE Connectivit      y (TEL) are both underperforming.Granted, stocks move in and out of BMO’s screens every quarter. Only 11 stocks have remained on BMO’s consistency list for more than 12 months. They are:            AbbVie      (ABBV), Aflac (AFL),            American Express      (AXP),          CBS      (CBS),          Celgene      (CELG),            Discover Financial Services      (DFS),            Mastercard      (MA),            O’Reilly Automotive      (ORLY),            Synchrony Financial      (SYF),          Total System Services      (TSS), and            Union Pacific      (UNP).Mastercard wins the crown for the longest tenure of consistency, making it on BMO’s list for 79 months. The stock has also been a consistent winner, gaining 18.7% on annualized basis over the past five years, beating the S&P 500 by an average of 12 percentage points, according to FactSet. It’s easy to see why: Mastercard is a free-cash-flow machine, boosting free cash at an 8.2% annualized rate. It’s also boosted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) at a healthy 12.8% rate.BMO analysts rate Mastercard a buy, along with CBS and Union Pacific. The stocks are doing their part to pull up the group, outperforming this year. Assuming that consistency is really showing up in their fundamentals, one might expect that trend to continue.

1,"Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe recently caused a kerfuffle with a defense-related investment, but his latest stock trades don’t touch on the sector.Inhofe is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and took to the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal in November to urge President Donald Trump to keep up defense spending.Then came a financial disclosure in early December that showed that Inhofe had purchased $50,001 to $100,000 of stock in defense contractor Raytheon (ticker: RTN) on Dec. 11, a transaction that appeared to be a conflict of interest. Inhofe said in a subsequent filing that he hadn’t been aware of the transaction, which had been executed by his financial advisor, and canceled the buy before it settled.Inhofe’s most recent disclosure, on Wednesday, shows no defense-related investment moves. He sold            XPO Logistics      (ticker: XPO) stock valued at between $15,001 and $50,000 on Dec. 13. The senator bought $50,001 to $100,000 of            TE Connectivity      (TEL) stock, and sold $15,001 to $50,000 of            Aptiv      (APTV) stock on Dec. 27. On the last day of the year, he sold $15,001 to $50,000 of          Celgene      (CELG) stock, and bought $15,001 to $50,000 of        SPDR S&P Biotech ETF      (XBI) shares.Disclosure rules don’t require exact values of transactions, only ranges.In response to a request for comment, Inhofe’s Senate office provided the following statement: “All of Senator Inhofe’s financial transactions are handled by a third-party advisor. The senator has had no involvement in and is not consulted about his stock transactions, and files the appropriate disclosure paperwork in accordance with the law.”The purchase of shares in TE Connectivity, a Swiss company that makes engineered connectors and sensors, came at the end of a weak year for the firm. TE tumbled 20% in 2018. In the middle of the year, TE CEO Terrence Curtin had been upbeat in an interview with Barron’s, but the outlook dimmed somewhat by October, when Curtin noted in the company’s fiscal-fourth-quarter report that he expected “a slower growth environment in some of our markets.”Inhofe’s trading of XPO stock has gone back and forth between buying and selling this year, records show. The most recent transaction before December was the purchase of $50,001 to $100,000 in the logistics firm’s stock on Oct. 25. We reported that the shares took a hit in response to a short-seller’s report in December.Inhofe had been buying Aptiv stock in June and October, but began selling in November. Barron’s is bullish on the automotive supplier. We see it providing “the key safety technologies to auto makers that will enable a driverless, all-electric future.”Celgene tumbled nearly 39% in 2018, weighed down by earnings disappointments and negativity about the biotech sector. It’s a shame, though, that Inhofe’s account sold stock on Dec. 31.            Bristol-Myers Squibb      (BMY) agreed to buy the company only days later, and the stock was up more than 30% so far in 2019 through Wednesday’s close.Inhofe did capture some of the Celgene upside—and a rally in the biotech sector—through the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF, as that company is the exchange-traded fund’s second-largest holding. The ETF is up nearly 13% so far in 2019.

1,"United Technologies      (ticker: UTX) rapidly revealed the results of its portfolio review after receiving approval for the          Rockwell Collins      acquisition last Friday. Management is splitting the firm into three parts, a plan that closely mirrors one that activist investor Dan Loeb spelled out in Third Point’s first-quarter 2018 letter. Loeb’s plan surfaced after CEO, Greg Hayes, had publicly spoken about a United Technologies portfolio review in September 2017. In Third Point’s letter, Loeb pointed to several recent spinouts that created shareholder value to justify his plan, including:            Danaher (DHR)/      Fortive (FTV);            Ingersoll-Rand      (IR)/Allegion (ALLE);            Northrop Grumman (NOC)/Huntington Ingalls      (HII); ITT/Xylem (XYL)/Exelis (XLS); and Tyco/Covidien/            TE Connectivity      (TEL).An equal-weighted portfolio of those pre- and post-spin companies returned 29% in the two years from the time the spunout firms began trading, 12 percentage points better than the overall market. There does appear to be a post-spin limbo period for the stocks, though. Checking performance from the times the spinouts were announced, there was little difference in the performance of the stocks and the market in the subsequent two years. United Technologies expects to take up to two years to complete the spins. CFO Akhil Johri told analysts on a conference call that separating the 1,200 legal entities that make up United Technologies will determine, to a large extent, that transition period. That length of time could increase the “limbo-risk” of these transactions. It’s a hazard Barclay’s analyst Julian Mitchell noted on Tuesday. He wrote to clients that in the time between the announcement and completion of spinouts, “the last 13 industrial stocks undergoing spins have underperformed the S&P by 4%.”  Barron’s speculated recently that the climate-control business would be the first to go, but that it could be sold. The decision to spin it out may affect other climate-control players including:             Ingersoll-Rand      (IR),            Lennox International      (LII) and            Johnson Controls International      (JCI). Without additional dramatic action, it looks like Carrier—the United Technologies brand name—won’t be sold or merged with one of those firms. Otis, the elevator portion of the United Technology business, is generally regarded as an attractive asset with high levels of recurring service revenues. The Finnish company            Kone      (KNEBV.finland) is the most directly comparable business and trades for 23 times estimates earnings. Many industrial conglomerates have caught spinout fever.            Honeywell      (HON) has spun out two assets. Barron’s profiled home technology firm            Resideo      (REZI) when that transaction was complete. And            General Electric      (GE) continues to spin out and sell assets. Other industrial conglomerates that may face pressure to conform to the trend could include 3M (MMM) or            Eaton      (ETN), although performance may not be the catalyst that drives those managements to spin out assets. Returns at 3M and Eaton have been 11% and 12.8%, respectively, over the past three years. The industrial components of the S&P 500 have returned 9.6% over that span. Still, they are large diversified business that haven’t spun out any assets historically. United Technology’s management updated guidance for 2018 when they announced the spins, but indicated that all the changes were a function of the acquisition. Now, investors should focus on spin “dis-synergies” and consider the tax implications if a spun-out business is purchased or merged. Stay tuned.

0,"It’s been a tough year for income investors. Rising interest rates have pressured various types of bonds and higher-yielding stock sectors, such as utilities. In response, fund managers are favoring shorter-dated securities—and higher-quality ones too.The Bloomberg Barclays 10-year U.S. Treasury Bellwethers index has returned -3.73% year to date through Sept. 30, and the 30-year index was off by 6.55%, according to JPMorgan Asset Management.Also underwater over that stretch are corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds—down 2.33%, 1.07%, and 0.66%, respectively.Even the relatively well-performing            ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats      exchange-traded fund (ticker: NOBL) has returned just 6.5% this year, trailing the S&P 500’s 10.9%. (The ETF tracks S&P 500 companies that have raised their dividend for at least 25 straight years.) For some perspective as the fourth quarter gets under way, Barron’s spoke to two veteran income investors: Dan Fuss, co-manager of the Loomis Sayles Bondfund (LSBRX), and Clyde McGregor, who co-manages the Oakmark Equity & Income fund (OAKBX). The Loomis Sayles fund is up 0.72% year to date; the Oakmark fund, up 0.96%. Stocks tend to constitute about 60% of the latter’s holdings, with various fixed-income holdings making up the remainder.“Interest rates are rising,” says Fuss, 85. “That, more than anything else, is the most important thing right now.”Note: Total returns as of Oct. 1Source: MorningstarThe 10-year Treasury was recently yielding 3.19%, up from about 2.4% at the end of last year. But it’s still well below its average nominal yield of 6.05% since 1958, according to JPMorgan. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.)Concerned about rising rates, Fuss has positioned the $12.1 billion fund more defensively by adding a lot of holdings with shorter maturities. Shorter-dated credits help to buffer the impact of rising rates, as bonds with longer maturities will make more payments than shorter-term holdings. In theory, the present value of those future cash flows can take a big hit when rates rise. Fuss has also put more emphasis on higher-quality issues. If rates were to rise another percentage point in a short time, longer-dated Treasuries “will probably outperform long corporates, but they will still get whacked 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%” in price, says Fuss. “That’s not good.” He also has increased the percentage of highly liquid holdings, including Treasury bills, to about 35% of the portfolio.“We are waiting for rates to go higher and spreads to widen out,” he says. “We are just much more conservative.”Oakmark’s McGregor, for his part, has a value investing framework focused on “how something is priced,” he notes.“Income has been overpriced” and “we have been defensive for quite some time, relative to duration risk,” says McGregor, 65, referring to the risk bonds face when interest rates spike.As of June 30, Oakmark Equity & Income had about 55% of its holdings in U.S. stocks and another 6% in non-U.S equities, according to Morningstar. Another 23% was in bonds, though only a tiny sliver of those holdings were in credits with maturities of more than 10 years. The fund’s largest stockholdings included            General Motors      (GM),            Bank of America      (BAC),            TE Connectivity      (TEL), and            Mastercard      (MA). Their respective yields were recently 4.5%, 2%, 2%, and 0.4%.  Corrections & Amplifications: The 10-year U.S. Treasury note was yielding 2.43% at the end of 2017.

1,"Shares of connector and sensor maker TE Connectivity (TEL) are down 77 cents, or 0.8%, to $93.24, after the company this morning reportedfiscal Q3 results that topped consensus, but missed consensus with its outlook for this quarter, though the company raised the year forecast. CEO Terrence Curtin, however, was upbeat in a phone interview in which he talked with me about the results.“The global economic environment has been pretty consistently healthy,” Curtin told me. “Business activity has stayed pretty consistent with the trends and momentum we’ve been seeing for well over a year now, with very good economic activity globally.Revenue in the three months ended in June rose 11.8%, year-over-year, to $3.76 billion, yielding earnings per share of $1.43. That was better than the average estimates for revenue of $3.69 billion and EPS of $1.37.But the forecast for revenue of $3.59 billion to $3.69 billion missed the consensus estimate of $3.7 billion.TEs global prominence, he says, is also an effect of the fact its parts, such as “connectors,” show up in an increasing variety of hardware. “You need to connect things to make electronics come together,” he says. “People are bringing connectivity, and data, to things that didn’t even have that connectivity before,” such as manufacturing equipment on the shop floor.TE makes a wide variety of parts that go into numerous electronics, inside cars, in capital equipment, in “connected” computing of all kinds.In factory equipment, “we are seeing pretty healthy investment,” says Curtin. “You’re seeing it in the European factory orders, youre seeing the benefit everywhere.” That trend was in place before last year’s U.S. tax cuts, he says.With over 500,000 products across 11 categories, TE is “a big indicator of the macro,” meaning, overall global economic health, said Curtin, in response to my question as to whether TE’s results are indicative of the industry and the economy generally. We cover the planet.About two-thirds of revenue comes from parts not out of a catalog but from custom parts, designed with customers in a “co-create” manner, says Curtin. Those parts are designed and built in facilities the company maintains throughout the world, giving TE a special perspective on global trends. “It’s very important to place engineers close to the engineering centers of the world,” he observes.Of course, with that global perspective comes the worry that the U.S. tariff battle with China will hit TE as much if not more than other parts of the electronics industry.Curtin sounded unconcerned, saying goods so far exposed to tariffs from either side are a small percentage of our business,” at less than 3% of our revenue. “We are not seeing any impact from the tariffs from the demand perspective.“We are a free trader,” is a phrase he likes to repeat. “We prefer not having tariffs. Anytime you put one on, it creates uncertainty.“You have supply chains built over decades, and there’s a lot of work that everyone does to focus on, How can we be the most competitive for the solution that has to get to the consumer?For TE’s purposes, we stay close to our customers” with those global engineering facilities, he says. “Our strategy has been to deploy manufacturing near our customers, and that could create opportunities over time as they are trying to solve the matter of the tariffs.“Of course, it creates challenges when you make investments; do you just wait?Ultimately, he believes, these things will be worked through.

1," This article first appeared on SumZero, the world’s largest research community of buyside investment professionals. In some cases Barron’s edits the research for brevity; professional investors can access the full version of this thesis and tens of thousands of others at SumZero.com.  Disclaimer: The author’s fund had a position in this security at the time of posting and may trade in and out of this position without informing the SumZero community.   • Recent price: $92.94• Target price: $140• Timeframe: 2-5 years    Overview: How would you like to own a supplier to the Ford Model T, back when 99% of the world was running on horse and carriage?Well you can’t.But you can own something almost as good, and for the low price of ~14x off 2019 earnings ($6.50 excluding buybacks and M&A; predicated on conservative mid-teen EPS growth off conservative 2018 guidance). Earnings should continue to compound at mid-teens for a decade-plus, with a free call option on autonomous driving that has more than 5x the connector content needed (not in my numbers). PS: All the electric vehicle (EV) stuff in this write-up also applies to NXPI, which I also recommend owning.I’m recommending            TE Connectivity      (TEL) as a long. Recent earnings allow for a great entry point, as results both confirmed the secular core thesis of accelerating content growth and alerted the public to unfiltered negative noise such as non-core SubCom’s weakness, global/North America auto production, and trade/tariff fears. TE Connectivity is a global provider of connectors and sensor technologies, serving multiple end markets such as automotive, A&D, industrial equipment, medical, energy/subcom, and consumer (data networks and appliances). The company enjoys ~30% market share in connectors within its largest segment of autos, and despite fragmented markets, has top-three market share in most of the applications it plays in. The Company has almost evenly split geographical exposure with very high Asia/China exposure. Autos is a huge percentage of the company, though North America autos is only 15% of the auto biz which is 40% of revenues (important to note).  Company TEL gave a pretty detailed background of the company at their December 2017 Investor Day (included with the SumZero research report), so I won’t go too much into the company itself. One thing I will mention about the history is that TE Connectivity was part of the large conglomerate Tyco, which was split up after a large scandal regarding accounting irregularities and fraud.The history with the Tyco break-up and damage fallout has afforded current shareholders increased transparency, as TEL reports three segments and nine sub-segments, among other detailed metrics. Management is conservative, as the growing backlog includes orders with cash deposits only, resulting in almost 0% cancellations historically. There is a large portion of orders not included in the backlog that almost every other industrial company would include. Thesis Secular growth in hybrid and electric vehicles (EV), and future autonomous driving technology, should drive outsized alpha generation for many years. The key to this thesis is that rising content growth in autos (50% of revenues) and industrials (30% of revenues) will drive HSD to LDD growth, almost irrespective of what happens to the global end market (math shown in report, with pretty conservative hybrid/EV content assumptions).The below chart (included with report) is well known to existing shareholders, but I will focus on why the below is underestimating the near-term opportunity (i.e. 2019+) given recent changes in China and Europe. As a more near-term catalyst, I’m calling for an acceleration of synchronous growth given accelerating Chinese auto demand dynamics, larger Industrial incremental margins, and a return to growth within the Comms segment as SubCom turns.1.2mm of the ~94mm global cars produced annually are EVs, with Hybrid+EV penetration at ~5mm units. Even though TEL’s content per vehicle is 2x higher in EVs ($120 average), this number varies wildly by OEM. When TEL is allowed to participate early on in the design process for EV models, the results can be outsized. On example is the NIO, where the average $ content is $500+. Luckily, this model is ripping right now and gaining market share in China.“If you are wondering which Chinese company leads the premium electric vehicle pack, wonder no more. It’s NIO.”People also forget that there are multiples more buses in China than in Western countries. Buses are mandated (and have already) gone 100% electric in some tier-1 cities. The effect is enough to even affect oil demand, which is significant despite how small buses are as a percentage of transportation—which is itself a small percentage of total oil usage. This government mandate will also drive growth going forward, even if production flatlines or even declines.Perhaps the most important dynamic to note is that China has pent-up auto demand. It’s surprising that most investors don’t know this, but just ask any Chinese citizen who’s been waiting to buy a car. Which brings me to the most important point. There are currently multi-year waiting lists in tier-1 Chinese cities, which will continue to drive EV demand, with a hockey stick starting in 2019 as new models are launched and solve the biggest pain for Chinese drivers: range.Why the acceleration? A green license plate initiative on top of subsidies and tax cuts allows citizens to IMMEDIATELY hit the road with an EV car versus a traditional ICE vehicle. In some cities such as Beijing, even green license plates have a small waiting list, implying that ICE registrations have little hope of hitting the streets anytime soon unless you expect to get VERY lucky. This is a game changer and a major cause of EV demand, as some niche investors in 2016/2017 were going as far as buying dozens of cheap cars just to win the license plate lottery to resell to those on the waiting list.Regarding Industrials, which has been beaten up in the past few weeks given a misread of CAT’s earnings call: I would read Emerson (EMR) and            Rockwell Automation      (ROK) recent transcripts for some conviction on the fact that we are nowhere near the peak of the cycle. In fact, we’re only about one year past trough, and I see 2020+ as peak for Industrials. Even if you didn’t believe this, factory floor automation and warehouse automation is seeing immense build-out as reshoring becomes a real theme and not just a talking point. Years of under-investment has created a massive aging installed base in the U.S.Combined with higher “electrification” content needed in robotic arms and other connected automation solutions, TEL should see even higher than LT guidance of MSD growth in 2H18 and 2019. Cash repatriation, tax reform, 100% accelerated depreciation, and localization all drive capex investment. Orders growth in the double digits gives me a lot of conviction in the industrial segment (30% of revenues), with the largest margin upside to 18%-19% in 2020E versus low teens today given rearview cost cutting and SG&A providing high incremental margins.Regarding SubCom, this business is very lumpy and becomes a tailwind rather than a headwind. What gives me comfort in growth coming back (which is not needed for the thesis) is the strong orders growth and conservative backlog buildup. TEL has record Subcom backlog, $600m YTD orders (higher orders for all of 2017), and Google has stated that they commissioned three new cables this year (per Google’s Q1 18 transcript).2019 should be a great year given the backlog and the high incremental margin at SubCom, which can then lead to a sale of the non-core biz as a medium-term catalyst.As an FYI, all the big tech companies are significantly increasing their spending on Hyperscale infrastructure. Google’s Q1 18 capex increased by more than 180% YoY.So why does the opportunity exist? Anything touching autos has gotten smoked but in any given recent month it’s been a mix of tariff/trade war fears combined with fears of declining auto production and/or North American seasonally adjusted annual rate. SubCom’s recent project delays were the most recent “issue” that popped up, despite it currently under-earning and contributing zilch to FCF and being a headwind to margins.First, TEL has proven that global auto production has nothing to do with growth. The company saw 10% core growth in Transportation despite flat auto production in 2Q18. Furthermore, math works out to HSD CAGR from content growth alone, using mgmt. estimates, which is outdated/too conservative. To frame the risk, North America is such a small piece of the business that even a draconian 5% decline in U.S. SAAR would be a headwind of only $0.02 to EPS. Global and U.S. SAAR is the ultimate red herring in this story.Though one can play the same theme with semis with high auto exposure (i.e Infineon and NXP), we believe the best connector play is with TEL given outlandish (50%+ revenue exposure) to autos and EVs, versus lower for comps like            Amphenol,      Aptiv, and            Ametek.      Most of these comps trade at higher valuations and still need to make substantial investments in R&D and capex versus TEL’s portfolio, which is already at the level for full autonomous driving.Furthermore, TEL has #1 market share in all geographies with harsh-environment connectors, which are mission-critical yet low-cost components relative to the total vehicle cost. This is a huge moat, as harsh environment connectors need to be able to transfer huge volumes of data within the car ecosystem and ECU while making sure there is 0 latency/lag. Imagine an autonomous vehicle going 70mph on the highway; there can be no lag or reliability issues or the driver would die.TEL’s market position and increasing design wins/market share are overlooked by the market, at the same time that secular trends are about to kick in. Given low leverage of 1x+, catalysts include increased buybacks, bolt-on M&A deals, a sale on SubCom or the Comms segment, and continued beats+raises for FY 2018. Free cash flow will ramp heavily as TEL converts growth and winds down working capital in 2H18. Risks: Short-term slowdown in EV mixshift, which is easily trackable via European and Asian car registrations (particularly PHEV and EV registrations),Global SAAR production (particularly a slowdown in Asia), trade war with Europe/China or both; though TEL produces locally with relatively low-cost components versus something more substantial such as Boeing planes.

0,"Revenue and profit estimates for the semiconductor industry continue to ratchet lower, amid a range of both supply-chain and demand issues. And the same process is under way for the chip equipment makers that serve them. But for both sectors, there are values to find if you know where to look.This morning, UBS chip analyst Timothy Arcuri reset estimates for his entire coverage universe, which includes all of the major chip and equipment companies. For most of the companies he covers, he reduced revenue forecasts for both 2020 and 2021, and he brought price targets down for most of the stocks he covers as well. He also shifted some ratings around. In a few cases, he’s feeling more bullish.Arcuri notes that revenue for the semiconductor industry fell 35% in two quarters during the 2008-09 downturn, and took three quarters to fully recover. But he adds that comparisons are easier this time, coming off a weak 2019, especially for memory chips. He writes that his new base case is for a 20% drop in semiconductor revenues through the September quarter with a gradual recovery to parity by June 2021. Calendar 2020 revenues, he says, will be off 15%-20% from pre-virus estimates. He adds that “computer” related stocks—            Intel       (ticker: INTC) and            Nvidia       (NVDA), for instance—should be more defensive, and that supply constraints should help on memory. (He likes            Micron.      ) But he sees risks for smartphone-related stocks, and weakness in the automotive chip sector.For the equipment sector, he says, revenue will follow semis lower, but he’s more bullish on the group than he is on chips. He says that “supply constraints should keep order books full making the snap-back faster than for semis,” and he adds that there are “few if any weak balance sheets among top chip spenders.” Arcuri also notes that Chinese customers “remain full speed ahead and may even accelerate timeliness.”Arcuri on Friday lifted his ratings on            Lam Research      (LRCX) to Buy from Sell and on            KLA       (KLAC) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT) to Neutral from Sell. He also upgrades            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Neutral from Sell.His bullish stance on Lam reflects the company’s out-sized exposure to the memory sector. He writes that Applied has growing exposure to memory, though he is concerned about the company’s display business, and he sees risk in its large exposure to the contract chip manufacturer            Taiwan Semiconductor      (TSM). He says KLA should get a boost from supply constraint issues in the equipment sector, though he thinks the story in the foundry and logic end markets—where KLA has significant exposure—isn’t as compelling as it is for memory.On Texas Instruments, Arcuri says that he still has concerns about their big exposure to the automotive and industrial vertical markets, but that the issue is already reflected in the stock price. “Virtually all of the company’s revenue growth over the past 4 years has come from this vertical so this remains a concern as we look forward but the sell side has also been aggressively cutting global production estimates over the past few weeks and highly visible production shut-downs in Europe make it hard to argue that investors have not contemplated this as a risk,” he writes.In Friday trading, amid a sharp market slide, chip and equipment stocks are trading lower across the board, with Lam, Arcuri’s favorite, down 6.4%, to $243.42.

0,"Many companies have suspended or cut dividends in recent weeks as the coronavirus outbreak has severely curtailed business, and hundreds more are possible in coming weeks and months. Beyond the basic need to conserve cash while business is depressed, the stimulus bill reportedly aims to restrict certain companies’ ability to pay dividends.“No companies were built to withstand zero revenue for an extended period of time,” says Bill Nygren, portfolio co-manager of the Oakmark fund (ticker: OAKMX). He calls the current market turmoil “uncharted territory.” Among the large U.S. companies that already have suspended their dividends are            Marriott International      (MAR),            Ford Motor      (F),            Nordstrom      (JWN), and            Boeing      (BA). Marriott and Nordstrom said the suspensions will take effect next quarter.IHS Markit      is forecasting that 230 of the largest 1,800 global companies will suspend their dividends.Even that gloomy assessment, however, doesn’t mean dividends are dead everywhere. “There are plenty of opportunities to find equity income right now,” says David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, though he cautions that it depends on the individual company and sector. “You have to make sure the company in which you are investing is well-capitalized.”Kelly is expecting a spike in unemployment, as major parts of the economy shut down, meaning companies’ cash flow is sure to take a hit. He says, however, that it’s important to take a long-term view—difficult though that is amid a “grim short-term outlook.”“There are plenty of sectors that will get through in a tough scenario,” Kelly says, pointing to financials and health care as examples.Nygren also likes financials, with a caveat. He says banks are “high on the list of attractive yields, but if the shutdown goes on long enough, I guess you’d have to add them to the vulnerable list.”Nygren says that two of his holdings “that seem to be less hurt by the shutdown than most” are            Texas Instruments      (TXN) and            CVS Health      (CVS). Both stocks recently yielded 3.6%. One potential silver lining for income investors during the pandemic’s gloom is the growing list of companies that are suspending their buybacks while maintaining their dividends, at least for now. Many of the large U.S. banks—along with companies in other sectors—have done that. For instance, energy firm            Chevron      (CVX) plans to suspend buybacks and slash capital spending by $4 billion, or 20%, as part of an effort to protect its dividend and support its balance sheet. The stock yields 7.2%. Chevron has been paying $1.29 a share per quarter, having declared an 8% boost in late January.Chip maker            Intel      (INTC) also said this week that it’s suspending buybacks to preserve its payout. The company said in a securities filing that the buyback suspension “will not impact dividend payments to stockholders and that the company has the ability to reinstate repurchases as circumstances warrant.” The stock yields nearly 2.5%.Elsewhere,            Dick’s Sporting Goods      (DKS), which yields nearly 6%, said in a filing Wednesday that it’s temporarily suspending its stock buybacks and evaluating its dividend. Retailing has been hit hard by the pandemic’s fallout, and more dividend suspensions in the sector are likely. One consolation: Dick’s said it plans to pay out its quarterly dividend of 31.25 cents a share on its common stock Friday for stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20.Whether it will deliver its dividend next quarter, or join many other companies in cutting, is a question that will be answered as the coronavirus toll becomes clearer. b Write to Lawrence C.

0,"Semiconductor shares were leading the market higher on a strong rebound day for the broader market Tuesday, as analysts and investors sort through the rubble of the downturn looking for likely winners coming out it. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised his rating Tuesday morning on            Nvidia       shares (ticker: NVDA) to Buy from Hold, setting a price target of $270. “We acknowledge it’s risky to upgrade a stock given this vicious pandemic and the subsequent economic fallout,” he writes in a research note. “However, during this uncertain time, we believe investors will flock to companies with superior balance sheets and robust free cash flow. Nvidia fits the bill.”Gill expects a pickup in demand for Nvidia graphics processors used for medical research applications in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. “GPUs can accelerate the analysis of whole genomes, which consist of 3 billion base pairs in human chromosomes, from days to less than one hour,” he writes. Gill also notes that with the stock down 35% from its peak as of Monday’s close, the stock trades at a multiyear P/E low.Goldman Sachs chip analyst Toshiya Hari chopped estimates across the board on Tuesday for both chip companies and semiconductor-equipment stocks—but he has a few stocks to recommend. Hari’s estimate cuts are driven by recent downward revisions in the outlook for key markets served by the chip industry. Goldman Sachs sees smartphone shipments this year down 1.4% from 2019, personal computer shipments off 10% and automotive sales down 3.5%. Hari writes that he has taken an approach of cutting estimates based on how various groups have fared in past recessions. “While we take no view on the development of Covid-19 and the impact it could have on end demand, and in turn, the semiconductor industry, we believe it is prudent to assume a peak-to-trough correction that is consistent with past downturns.”In reviewing the group, Hari shuffled some ratings, lifting his stance on            Xilinx       (XLNX) to Buy from Neutral and            Intel      (INTC) to Neutral from Sell. But he cut            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Sell from Neutral, and            Cabot Microelectronics      (CCMP) to Neutral from Buy. He also removed            Applied Materials      (AMAT) from Goldman’s conviction list, while keeping his Buy rating on the equipment company.Xilinx makes field-programmable gate arrays, parts used in communications, data center, aerospace and other applications. While Hari says Xilinx isn’t immune to a downturn, he contends that the underperformance of Xilinx shares over the past 3, 6 and 12 months reduces the stock’s risk. He thinks fundamentals in the communications sector are “at or near trough,” and writes that data center remains “a secular growth business.” Hari contends that other key sectors for Xilinx—aerospace and defense—in addition to test and instruments are less economically sensitive than other chip end markets. The analyst also notes that Xilinx, as a chip maker that doesn’t operate its own factories, “has historically demonstrated relative gross margin stability during economic downturns” and that “relative valuation multiples are near-trough” levels. Hari concludes that any signs of improving earnings should drive an outsize gain in Xilinx shares. For Texas Instruments, Hari cut his price target to $88 from $123. He notes that the stock is often perceived as a haven, but that weakness in many of its key end markets as well as “above-peer operating leverage,” given it operates its own factories, “should pressure margins over the next few quarters and drive negative earnings-per-share revisions in excess of those for its peers.”As for Intel, Hari writes that there are “multiple near-term positive developments that could largely offset the headwinds,” including resilience in the server market and potentially in personal computers as more people work and study from home. But he says that because of increased competition, growing capital intensity and pressure on margins, he would avoid overweighting the stock.The downgrade of Cabot Micro, Hari says, reflects a special situation. The company’s core electronics materials business, which makes slurries used in chip-making, “is a high-growth, high margin business with a deep/wide competitive moat, and one that we continue to view positively long term.” But the company also makes drag reducing agents, or DRAs, used by oil pipelines. And he sees Cabot feeling the impact on that business as oil pipeline operators in the Permian Basin reduce their use of DRAs. Hari notes that Cabot is down 78% from its highs in February, but that “uncertainty surrounding the DRA business” will likely “weigh on multiples for the foreseeable future.”Near midday Tuesday, Nvidia was up 18%, Intel up 7.5% and Xilinx gained 6.2%. Texas Instruments rallied 5.4%, Cabot climbed 4% and Applied Materials jumped 12.6%.

0,"The semiconductor sector could see earnings fall as much as 70% on average if the coronavirus pandemic triggers a global recession, according to Citi.“We believe it is time to assume a recession is coming given the extreme disruption happening to several businesses,” analyst Christopher Danely writes in a new research note. “As a result, we analyzed how far estimates fell in past downturns. We are not lowering estimates as we believe this is an exercise in futility given we’ll just have to change them again in a month and it is impossible to gauge how bad things can get.”Danely writes that his analysis of previous downturns from 2008-2019 indicates average consensus estimates can fall as much as 70% on average—with some declining 100%. In the 2008 downturn, the mean chip stock earnings estimate fell 70%—and the        PHLX Semiconductor Stock      Index, fell a stunning 88%, drastically outpacing the 39% decline in the        S&P 500.      The analyst says the companies in his coverage universe that have historical had the smallest cuts to estimates are            Xilinx      (ticker: XLNX) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), noting that both also have been among the best-performing stocks in a downturn. He thinks Xilinx will see relatively small estimate cuts this time, but that Qualcomm could have issues “given all the demand destruction in cellphones.”Danely says the largest cuts to earnings estimates historically have been suffered by            Micron      Technology (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). He thinks AMD again is likely to suffer among the largest estimate cuts, but Micron “might buck the trend.”The companies that interest Danely the most right now are            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and Micron. “Texas Instruments has been among the best performers so far during the downturn and we would expect that to continue,” he writes. “Microchip has been among the worst performers but we believe it is unwarranted and would aggressively buy the stock. We also believe Micron might buck the trend given the oligopoly in DRAM and strength in the server end market.”He also notes that “checks indicate server demand has remained strong throughout the volatile order patterns, due...to trends of more people working from home and online demand for various products.” That’s good news for            Intel      (INTC), AMD, and Micron.Semiconductor stocks have recovered more than 6.5% on Tuesday, well ahead of the 4.7% rebound by the S&P 500.

0,"W.W. Grainger      and            Tiffany      are sector leaders in Barron’s third annual ranking of the America’s Most Sustainable Companies.Supplier Grainger (ticker: GWW) tops the industrials sector, according to Calvert Research & Management, which compiles the ranking, while jewelry retailer Tiffany (TIF) is No. 1 in consumer discretionary. Meanwhile,            Voya Financial       (VOYA) sits atop the financials sector,            Clorox      (CLX) is No. 1 in consumer staples, and            Texas Instruments      (TXN) has the best sustainability ranking in information technology.In an interview with Barron’s, D.G. Macpherson, CEO of Grainger, said the industrial supplier helps customers curb usage of water, electricity and other resources. Green products, which Grainger qualifies for itself, now account for 5% of firm sales. The supplier has moved to reduce emissions, partly by grouping orders to be sent to clients. “We feel that we’re out front in providing those solutions,” says Macpherson. “To the extent that we can have measurable actions, we think it’s important for all of business.”Separately, Calvert, a unit of            Eaton Vance       (EV), also supplied a ranking of real-estate investment trusts, with            Kilroy Realty       (KRC) as the most sustainable real-estate investment trusts. Calvert typically excludes REITs because they aren’t operating companies, and are “a different asset class,” designed for tax purposes, Calvert’s Chris Madden says. There are, however, real estate management and operating companies in the overall ranking.Source: Calvert Research & Management; BloombergSource: Calvert Research & Management; BloombergSource: Calvert Research & Management; BloombergSource: Calvert Research & Management; BloombergSource: Calvert Research & Management; BloombergSource: Calvert Research & Management; BloombergTo create the various Barron’s lists, Calvert started with the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies by market value then ranked each by how they performed for five key constituencies: shareholders, employees, customers, community, and the planet. Specifically, it looked at more than 230 performance indicators that address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues, such as workplace diversity, data security, and greenhouse-gas emissions. Based on the indicators, Calvert assigned a score of zero to 100 in each stakeholder category. Then, it created a weighted average of the categories for each company, based on how financially material each category was for its industry peer group.  Write to Leslie P.

1,"Micron Technology      shares spiked Wednesday morning after UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri lifted his rating on the stock to Buy from Neutral and raised his target price to $75 from $47. Arcuri’s bet: Micron’s fortunes are going to measurably improve as the dynamics in the memory-chip industry recover. “As cyclical concerns evaporate, structural dynamics should carry the day,” he said in a research note.Arcuri wrote that “the time has finally come when Micron (ticker: MU) can materially outperform over a sustained period of time.” After assessing the cyclical and structural aspects of both Micron and the memory industry as a whole, Arcuri concluded that Micron “is in a much stronger position in a structurally better industry on the cusp of a cyclical upswing.” He thinks that the improving cycle in DRAM should last deep into calendar 2021.The analyst said he thinks Micron deserves a higher multiple “given its improving competitive position and through-cycle financial performance” comparable with or even better than other major chip companies with integrated manufacturing models, such as            Intel       (INTC) or            Texas Instruments      (TXN).Arcuri thinks the industry is headed into a 2-year period of DRAM undersupply. For NAND memory, he sees a shorter period of short supply lasting through the calendar 2020 first half, but with a flip back to oversupply after that. DRAM is used in desktop computers and servers, while NAND is flash memory, found in smartphones and solid-state hard drives. The analyst raised his EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending in August 2020 to $2.70, from $1.75, now well above the Street consensus at $2.30. For fiscal 2021, he jumps his forecast up to $7.42 from $4.06, above consensus at $5.51.Micron shares were up 6% to $60.69 near midday, and traded as high as $61, a new 52-week high.

1,"Three numbers to start your day:Keep up, fourth-quarter earnings season continues. Several major companies in the health-care space will report this week. Among the highlights are            Allergan      (AGN) and            DaVita      (DVA), who report on Monday,            CVS Health      (            CVS      ) on Wednesday, and on Friday, we’ll hear from            AstraZeneca      (AZNCF). Other highlights include            Lyft      (LYFT) and            Under Armour      (UA) -- they report on Tuesday. And on Wednesday, we’ll hear from            Applied Materials      (AMAT) and            Barrick Gold      (GOLD).And Thursday looks especially busy: Investors will be watching as            Nvidia      (NVDA), Alibaba Group Holding (BABA),            Expedia Group      (EXPE), KraftHeinz (KHC), and            Pepsico      (PEP) all report their earnings results.—in 2019. That means they beat the S&P 500 index. The 100 companies are part of Barron’s third annual ranking. It shows that America’s corporations are getting more sustainable.And investors are benefiting—along with, of course, the planet and the rest of its inhabitants.            Agilent Technologies      (A),            Texas Instruments      (TXN), and            Voya Financial      (VOYA) topped the list in 2019.One boost to performance is that good environmental policies like saving on water, fuel, or waste can lower costs. And studies show that sustainable enterprises are better at retaining their employees. Plus, good-for-the-Earth practices can help attract customers -- some people prefer to do business with companies that treat the environment well.—last week.

0,"Traditional dividend havens such as utilities and real estate investment trusts are expected to continue that role, with yields in the 3% range this year. Those looking for more robust dividend growth should consider sectors such as health care and technology. The health and tech sectors in the S&P 500 index are expected to notch the best dividend growth this year on a per share basis, 10% for health care and 9% for tech, according to consensus estimates. Those two sectors are expected to increase their earnings this year by roughly 10%, compared with mid-single digits for utilities and REITs.IHS Markit,      a financial-data firm, expects U.S. dividends paid out to total a record $663 billion this year, up 7.2% from 2019’s levels—but below the 7.9% gain the previous year. That 2020 estimate, which excludes special dividends, covers the entire U.S. stock market, including the S&P 500.These are consensus estimates. *Estimated growth compared to previous year.Sources: Bloomberg, FactSet,Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchThe slower dividend growth “is mainly attributed to a slowdown in earnings growth when compared with 2018 earnings growth, which was boosted by tax cuts,” IHS Markit says in its 2020 forecast.  Still, there should be plenty of dividend growth this year across various sectors, starting with health care. Dividends usually grow in line with earnings, and the health-care sector, from large pharmaceutical firms to a major prescription-drug distributor, offers plenty of strength. “The amount of money spent on prescription drugs has nearly doubled over the past three decades as pharmaceuticals sales and profit margins have ballooned,” the forecast says.The consensus earnings estimate for the            Health Care Select Sector SPDR       (ticker: XLV), a good proxy for larger health-care companies, is $6.31 a share, up 8% from $5.82 in 2019.In its recent assessment of dividend trends, IHS Markit noted that the health-care sector “has shown a very aggressive capital deployment stance in fiscal-year 2019 with mergers and acquisitions being the top priority followed by rising cash dividends.”IHS Markit expects the sector to boost its dividends by 9.3%, helped by sustainable free cash flow and lower debt levels.Goldman Sachs      shares IHS Markit’s optimistic outlook for health-care dividend stocks. For analytical purposes, Goldman divides the broad market into various baskets of stocks, one of which focuses on dividend growth. That particular basket, Goldman Sachs wrote in a note dated Jan. 3, “offers longer-term investors a premium yield while positioning for a value rotation.” Growth stocks have outperformed value names for many years, though value stocks did better in the last four months of 2019. Goldman Sachs observed in the research note that “the outlook for growth and value remains muddy” as stand-alone investments, and that “we recommend strategies that combine growth and value.” Goldman’s dividend-growth basket of stocks was recently yielding 3.6%, compared with 2.1% for the S&P 500, and it traded at a substantial discount to the broader market. These stocks offer 10% dividend growth through next year, compared with 5% for the broader market, Goldman Sachs says. The health-care stocks in the basket are            AbbVie      (ABBV), which recently yielded 5.3%;            Gilead Sciences      (GILD), 3.9%;            Pfizer      (PFE), 3.9%;            Cardinal Health       (CAH), 3.9%;            Amgen      (AMGN), 2.7%;            Bristol-Myers Squibb      (BMY), 2.8%; and            Eli Lilly      (LLY), 2.2%.  Meanwhile, the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to increase their dividends by an average of 9% on a per-share basis, based on consensus estimates. IHS Markit notes that “many of the leading tech payers have relatively large cash balances and low debt profiles, reinforcing the sector’s status as top payer.” That includes            Microsoft      (MSFT), which has regularly increased its dividend at a double-digit pace, and            Apple      (AAPL), whose net cash at the end of September totaled $98 billion. Microsoft was recently yielding 1.3%, and Apple was at 1%—both well below the S&P 500’s average of about 2%.The yields of Microsoft and Apple are also punier than the tech stocks in the Goldman Sachs dividend-growth basket. But in terms of total dividend payouts expected this year, Microsoft and Apple are expected to rank in the top five of U.S. companies, according to IHS Markit.The tech names in Goldman’s dividend-growth basket include            Texas Instruments      (TXN), which recently yielded 2.8%;            IBM       (IBM), 4.8%;            Broadcom      (AVGO), 4.2%;            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), 3%; and            NetApp      (NTAP), 3.1%.Of course, health care and tech aren’t the only sectors that offer dividend growth. Based on consensus estimates, consumer-discretionary and energy companies in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends this year by 8% on average. Consider, though, that the            Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR       exchange-traded fund (XLY), a proxy for companies in that sector, yields about 1.3%—not all that enticing. And energy stocks have lagged behind the broader market, their attractive yields notwithstanding. The            Energy Select Sector SPDR      ETF (XLE) was recently yielding about 3.7%.Utilities in the S&P 500 are expected to boost their dividends on a per share basis by an average of 7%, a respectable gain if it occurs. However, many of these stocks have been bid up, as investors seek yield in a low-rate environment, essentially treating them as a bond proxy. The            Utilities Select Sector SPDR      ETF (XLU), for example, trades at about 19.7 forward earnings estimates, some 15% above its five-year average of 17.2 times, according to FactSet.Income investors could also turn to the financial, materials, and industrial sectors of the S&P 500 for yield growth. Such stocks are expected to boost their dividends by 6% this year on a per share basis, according to consensus estimates. Take financials, for instance. They are expected to yield 2.2% on average, and many individual banks sport even higher yields.            JPMorgan Chase’s      (JPM) was recently at 2.6%, the same as            Citigroup’s      (C).            Wells Fargo      (WFC) was at 3.8%, compared with a 2.1% yield for            Bank of America      (BAC).Although dividend growth should slow this year, there should still be plenty of yield available in various sectors. But it’s important to understand the fundamentals of a company, even if its yield is alluring. • Write to Lawrence C.

1,"It’s been an odd year for semiconductor stocks. Fundamentally, 2019 has been challenging. For the full year, industry revenue, excluding the volatile memory sector, will be down 6% to 8% this year, after 8% growth in 2018, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur. But the stocks have been on a rip-roaring rally. The strong performance reflects anticipation of better fundamentals ahead—a recovery Sur thinks will drive further stock gains.So far this year, the PHLX Semiconductor Index (ticker: SOX) has soared 55%, well ahead of the 32% gain for the        Nasdaq Composite      and a 26% rally by the        S&P 500.      In a research note Monday morning, the J.P. Morgan analyst writes that he sees the rally extending from here. Sur projects 15% to 20% gains for the average semiconductor stock over the next 12 to 18 months, as fundamentals improve. He projects 2020 overall semiconductor industry revenue growth of 4% to 7%, with profits improving 8% to 12%.“We see strength in mobile, gaming, datacenter, and PCs with industrial demand trends likely to improve in 2020—overall driving a positive year-over-year cyclical inflection in industry growth” starting in the first half of 2020, he writes. “Longer-term, we continue to expect the semiconductor industry to exhibit relatively stable and less cyclical growth characterized by low-to mid-single-digit percentage annual revenue growth and high single-digit percentage unit growth.”Sur’s top pick in semis is            Broadcom      (AVGO), based on “under-appreciated diversification,” strong free cash flow, and dividend growth.

1,"Dividend investing often involves a trade-off between stocks with higher yields and those with faster growth.One company, ProShares, is putting its chips in the latter bucket—in keeping with its longtime bent—as it launches two new exchange-traded funds later this week.The ProShares S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats ETF (ticker: TDV), which has 34 holdings, will focus on technology companies that have raised their dividends for at least seven straight years. Tech isn’t always considered a go-to sector for dividends, though plenty of well-established companies offer them, including            Apple      (AAPL),            Cisco Systems      (CSCO), and            Oracle      (ORCL).Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, argues that dividend growth companies can add qualities such as better margins and earnings consistency to a portfolio’s composition.“You can apply dividend growth in areas where people haven’t historically thought about high-growth companies,” he says.The fund’s holdings include            Visa      (V),            Texas Instruments      (TXN), and            Microsoft      (MSFT). The new ETF will focus on the S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrat Index, which was recently yielding 2.04%.The fund’s operating expenses are listed at 0.45%, and its holdings are equally weighted.The other new ProShares ETF—the all-cap ProShares Russell U.S. Dividend Growers (TMDV)—has 68 holdings and tracks the Russell 3000 Dividend Elite index, which targets companies in the        Russell 3000      index that have raised their dividends for at least 35 straight years. The Dividend Elite index recently yielded 2.52%. Compared with the Russell 3000 index, the ETF is overweight mid- and small-cap names. Its holdings are equally weighted.

0,"Don’t give up on smartphone growth just because iPhone sales aren’t growing. Apple      (ticker: AAPL) iPhone sales dropped 9% year over year in its fiscal fourth quarter, reported Wednesday. That could be bad news for Apple suppliers. But stock of            Universal Display      (OLED)—an Apple suppler—was up more than 13% Thursday morning after the company smashed Wall Street earnings estimates and raised full-year 2019 sales guidance. It is all about product mix and increasing complexity for Universal. The company makes organic light-emitting diodes, or OLEDs for use in computer displays and solid-state lighting applications. That is a mouthful. It makes the fancy, energy-efficient screens for the newest generation of smartphones. Universal sales rose more than 25% in the third quarter. “We are pleased to report another quarter of solid results,” CFO Sidney Rosenblatt said in the company’s news release. “During the quarter, OLED activity continued to gain strength on a global scale.” Sales guidance was increased by about $25 million, or 7%, which is a big bump given there is only one quarter left in the year. The company feels good about 2020, too. “The premium smartphone market, I think, is something that will continue to grow,” Rosenblatt said in response to an analyst’s question during the company’s earnings conference call. “I mean, a lot of folks are talking about 5G being a push for people to switch, and it might be something that will keep a smartphone market moving ahead. I mean we were very positive on 2020.”That’s better news than investors have received from some other notable tech companies this quarter.            Texas Instruments      (TXN) outlook surprised investors last week. And not is a good way. Shares dropped more than 7% the day following its evening news release. Texas Instruments guided analysts to 91 cents a share for fourth-quarter earnings. Wall Street was predicting $1.28 a share to finish out 2019. “Our sense is that customers are just far more cautious than they were certainly a year ago, but even 90 days ago,” CFO Rafael Lizardi said on the company’s earnings conference call. Part of that caution is driven by trade conflict between the U.S. and China. A resolution would help the tech sector. But there are signs things are improving without a trade pact. Materials-science company            DuPont de Nemours      (DD) showed only that things are getting less bad in its electronics business, reporting recently that electronics sales were flat in the third quarter. That’s not great, but sales fell in the first and second quarters. DuPont, like Universal Display, is part of the global electronics supply chain making many products that enable the manufacture of microchips. Both companies benefit from mix and complexity upgrades. As microprocessors become more complex, for instance, they need more layers of silicon. That means more growth for DuPont and is one of the reasons its volume declines have stopped. DuPont shares were up 1.2% after reporting third-quarter numbers Thursday. For the year, however, shares are down about 9%, worse than the 18% comparable gain of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Texas Instrument shares dipped after recent results, but shares are still up about 25% year to date. Apple stock is also on a tear—despite lower iPhone volumes—up about 60%. Still, Universal Display stock has bested them all up more than 110% year to date. Even if the broader chip space isn’t growing yet, investors still have the trend of more-powerful, feature-rich phones to consider.            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) are two handset suppliers benefiting from increased complexity. That pair of stocks is up more than 30% year to date.

After the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      rallied 115.27 and the S&P 500 closed at a new high of 3,046.77 on Wednesday, stock futures were pulling back this morning. One reason? Bloomberg Television reported China has doubts it can reach a long-term trade deal with the U.S. More data is ahead—weekly jobless claims and consumer spending—which come on the heels of another interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy looks strong enough not to need more cuts in the future. We’ll see.Investors will be reacting to results from those big tech names and wading through more reports, from            DuPont      (ticker: DD),            Clorox      (CLX), and others. Still enthralled by big tech names such as Apple? BlueBox Asset Management’s co-portfolio manager William De Gale who says it’s time for investors to look past that household names toward companies on the cutting edge of the next big technology shift—connecting computers to the real world.“I want to own companies that are going to be dramatically better than five years from today,” the former BlackRock tech fund manager tells MarketWatch in an interview. In the Global Technology Fund he manages, he offers up alternatives like decades-old            Texas Instruments      (TXN). “It makes power management integrated circuits, a very small, very cheap chip that controls the flow around a circuit, and basically allows a battery to last as long as possible,” said De Gale, who adds that Texas Instruments has very little competition. Then there’s            EPAM Systems      (EPAM), a software-services company that made Fortune’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list for 2019. “They write software for companies that can’t do it themselves, mostly working for non-tech companies,” so in a sense a “sophisticated niche business,” he says.Also            Cadence Design Systems      (CDNS), which writes software to help chip designers design chips. De Gale says it stands out among the competition—            Synopsys      (SNPS) and Mentor Graphics, which was acquired in 2016 by            Siemens      (SIE.Germany).

0,"Forensic accountant Harry Markopolos alleged last week, among other charges in his explosive 175-page report, that            General Electric’s      reported profit margins are too high.That got us thinking: It can be hard to judge one financial metric, good or bad, without access to reams of financial data. So we looked up margins by industry.  Barron’s examined three-year average operating profit margins for stocks in the        S&P 500.      Operating profits are essentially profits earned before interest and taxes. We also looked at the median margin, as well as minimum and maximum margins. Overall, about 16% is a “normal” operating margin for a company in the S&P 500.The highest three-year average operating margins by group in our data are: exchange            CME Group      (CME) in Financials,            PPL      (PPL) in Utilities,            Texas Instruments      (TXN) in Technology,            VeriSign      (VSRN) in Communications, biotech company            Nektar Therapeutics      (NKTR) in Staples, railroad            Union Pacific      (UNP) in Industrials, lithium miner            Albemarle      (ALB) in Basic Materials,            McDonald’s      (MCD) in Consumer Cyclicals, and            Diamondback Energy      (FANG) in Energy. The Markopolos report also compared Bernie Madoff’s reported asset returns to GE operating margins. Investors should not compare return figures to operating margins figures. Returns and margins are linked, but not directly comparable. A better comparison would be to compare asset manager returns to returns on common equity, returns on invested capital, or perhaps returns on assets. Any of those measures tell how efficiently companies earn money. Take            Amazon      CEO Jeff Bezons, for example. If Bezos earns $1 billion dollars in 2020, he will make only about 1% on his total capital—not very good. If the average investor becomes even a multi-millionaire, on the other hand, it would mean they found the alchemists’ formula to turn lead into gold. One return is superior to the other. The average return on assets for the S&P 500 is about 6%. Returning to            General Electric      (GE), the company’s reported operating margins for the past three years are a negative 6%, lower than historical average because of problems at GE Capital and GE Power. Reported GE operating margins reached 16.1% in 2001. Our GE observations are based on reported financial statements and not on supplementary segment reporting. The Markopolos report objects to differences between reported margins by segment and margins reported by GE. The biggest non-segment expense reported by any company is usually corporate overhead. GE CEO Larry Culp has said recently wants to bring down corporate overhead. “What you’re going to see us do over time is not necessarily target corporate expense to a dollar level today or as a percent of sales,” he said in March. “But we’re going to bring it down dramatically.” Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comForensic accountant Harry Markopolos alleged last week, among other charges in his explosive 175-page report, that General Electric’s reported profit margins are too high.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Once again, waiting has paid off for Warren Buffett.Berkshire Hathaway      (ticker: BRKa, BRKb) affiliates have recently been buying shares of energy giant            Phillips 66      (PSX). Earlier this year, we noted that Buffett had lost money on shares purchased in 2015 and that shares purchased earlier in 2016 had gained less than 2%, excluding dividends.Now the            Oracle      of Omaha is sitting on solid gains with the stock market’s surge, and with a slightly larger stake.Regulatory filings show that Berkshire affiliates bought over $93 million more in Phillips 66 shares since our story was published. From Aug. 25 through Sept. 15, those affiliates bought 1,203,711 Phillips 66 shares, paying $77.33 each on average. Phillips 66 stock strengthened in the days after the presidential election and all 80,689,892 Phillips 66 shares that Berkshire affiliates now hold are comfortably in the black. In fact, those latest 1.2 million-odd shares purchased now sport a 12.7% return through Monday’s close.Buffett’s beneficial stake in Phillips 66 now stands at 15.5% and Berkshire is the company’s top holder.Reached by email for comment on Berkshire’s latest stock purchases, a Phillips 66 spokesman provided the statement, “It is our policy not to comment on matters involving individual investors.”  Yelp Stock Has Doubled And Can Double Again    Nordstrom’s Negatives Make Stock Hard to Buy    Generic Drug Price-Fixing Case May Grow in Scope  Berkshire didn’t return a phone call seeking comment.It is interesting that the election of Donald Trump has given Phillips 66--and the stock market as a whole--a lift. Buffett was a supporter of rival Hillary Clinton’s campaign. At an Omaha rally this summer, Buffet called out Mr. Trump: “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”Decent returns are Buffett’s consolation for not being able to see his preferred candidate take the oath of the country’s highest office.Interestingly enough, Trump himself may still own $250,000 in shares of Phillips 66.If he hasn’t sold them yet, that is.As we stand at the cusp of a new year, what is Buffett contemplating? He could, as always, wait well into 2017 and beyond, to see if anything strikes his fancy. If Phillips 66 dips back into the high $70s, he could scoop up more stock.Maybe another question that should be asked is what are the plans of the two former hedge-fund managers that Buffett recently hired?Todd Combs, who joined Berkshire in 2011, and Ted Weschler, who arrived a year later, have more of an affinity with technology than Buffett. Combs and Weschler were behind Berkshire’s purchase of            Apple      (AAPL) stock in the first quarter. Another Berkshire investment thought to be made by Combs and Weschler is the stake in Internet domain registrar and security company            VeriSign      (VRSN), initially reported in a July 31, 2014, filing.Berkshire affiliates trimmed back on April 29, selling 32,255 VeriSign shares for $2.88 million, or about $89.30 each. The sale was timed well, as it was near the 52-week intraday high of $91.99; shares closed at $78.09 on Monday. Berkshire still beneficially owns 12,952,745 VeriSign shares, a stake of about 12%, and remains the third-largest holder in the company, according to S&P Capital IQ.

1,"When Warren Buffett, the third wealthiest person in the world, acquires a stake in a company, investors pay close attention, especially as shares often rise when such news is disclosed. A recent screen searched for stocks that could appeal to Buffett turned up            Sysco      (SYY), the food distributor;            Cummins      (CMI), a maker of heavy-duty engines; and            Illinois Tool Works      (ITW), a roll-up of industrial equipment manufacturers.Investors dont have to guess which stocks Warren Buffett likes, of course. His investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (            BRKA      ) (          BRKB),      must report its positions each quarter, and from these 13-f filings investors can deduce recent buys and sells.A Feb. 14 filing shows that Berkshire last quarter took new stakes in crop processor            Archer Daniels Midland      (ADM) and            VeriSign      (VRSN), which provides Internet services like domain name registry. It trimmed exposure to            Johnson & Johnson      (JNJ) and cut          Kraft      (KFT). It added to stalwarts like            IBM      (IBM),            General Motors      (GM),            Wal-Mart      (WMT) and            Wells Fargo      (WFC). Berkshire also added to holdings of smaller companies:          DirectTV      (DTV), drilling equipment maker            National Oilwell Varco      (NOV);            Wabco Holdings       (WAB), which sells train brakes;            DaVita Healthcare Partners      (DVA), which provides kidney dialysis; and          Precision Castparts      (PCP), which makes high-end casts that give shape to things like airplane engine blades and artificial knees. Plenty of these stocks can still be had cheaply. Archer Daniels, for example, sells for 13 times this years earnings forecast, versus 14 times for the broad U.S. stock market. Investors seeking to beat Buffett to his next pick, however, may take interest in recent research from Thomson Reuters analyst John Kozey. He screened the market for companies with a handful of attributes Buffett is known to favor. Among them are modest debt, attractive valuations and growing (but not necessarily fast-growing) revenues and profits. To judge valuation, Kozey used a measure called EV/Ebitda. Enterprise value, on the top side of the ratio, adjusts a companys stock value for its debt and cash. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, on the bottom side of the ratio, is a measure of profits that ignores some non-cash charges that stem from past investments rather than current operations. Merger-and-acquisition analysts sometimes use EV/Ebitda to judge whether companies are priced right for takeovers.Kozeys screen turned up 28 names in total. Only one, Archer Daniels, is a current Berkshire Holding, which illustrates how no screen can precisely match the tastes of Buffett himself. The list of screen survivors is a good place to start a search for stock bargains, however. Sysco is the largest food distributor in North America, with an 18% share of the market. Its size gives it better profit margins than peers and a sales network thats difficult for competitors to match. It also makes Sysco a natural buyer for smaller distributors; it bought four in December. A jump in food prices last year cut into the companys profits, but prices have cooled off of late. Wall Street expects the companys revenues to increase 6% this year and next. Shares come with a 3.4% dividend yield.This column recommended Cummins (CMI) shares back in October (see Cummins Can Come Back). Theyre up 35% since then, but still look affordable at 13 times earnings. Cummins makes engines for trucks and generators, building the most lucrative components in-house and outsourcing the rest to others. It stands to benefit long-term from rising construction in emerging markets, which will spur truck purchases, and tighter emissions controls the world over, which will drive many truck owners to replace their fleets. Cummins comes with a 1.8% dividend yield, and its payment looks in need of a boost, making up less than one-quarter of profits. Illinois Tool Works has a long history of making tiny takeovers of manufacturing companies and giving each local control over operations. That has resulted in more than 800 decentralized divisions, and not enough cost-savings to please major shareholders. The company announced in December that it would reduce its number of divisions to 150; consolidate managers, factories and raw-materials buying; shed slow-growing or low-margin businesses; and look for fewer small acquisitions (but perhaps some larger ones). All of this could result in a gradual rise in profit margins in coming years and turn a pretty good stock (it has doubled in price over the past decade and carries a 2.5% dividend yield) into a better one.Heres the full list of screen survivors:Mosaic      (MOS)Newmont Mining      (NEM)PPG Industries      (PPG)Air Products & Chemicals      (APD)Nucor      (NUE)Eastman Chemical      (EMN)Johnson Controls      (JCI)General Mills      (GIS)Archer Daniels Midland      (ADM)Sysco      (SYY)Hershey      (HSY)Campbell Soup      (CPB)Coca-Cola Enterprises      (CCE)Baker Hughes      (BHI)Transocean      (RIG)Illinois Tool Works      (ITW)CSX      (CSX)Norfolk Southern      (NSC)Cummins      (CMI)Paccar      (PCAR)Ingersoll Rand      (IR)Tyco International      (TYC)Parker Hannifin      (PH)Stanley Black & Decker      (SWK)Dover      (DOV)Rockwell Automation      (ROK)Republic Services      (RSG)Fluor      (FLR) Comments?

0,"Companies with higher environmental, social, and governance factors have outperformed the broad market since its February peak, contradicting views that the trend is just a bull-market phenomenon.In a new report, companies with better ESG risk profiles beat those with lower ones since the        S&P 500 peaked on Feb. 19, according to a report by Sara Mahaffy, U.S. equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Meanwhile, two-thirds of actively managed sustainable equity funds were beating their benchmark in March, Mahaffy pointed out. They were helped by the fact that they were underweight in energy and financials; held higher-quality stocks as measured by higher returns on equity, invested capital, and assets; and they tend to own popular S&P 500 names that have held up better, such as            Microsoft      (ticker: MSFT),            Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Visa      (V), and            Apple      (AAPL). Flows into ESG exchange-traded funds stayed positive into March, Mahaffy wrote.“This is not a bubble or a trend,” says Erika Karp, CEO of Cornerstone Capital, an investment advisor with a sustainable focus. “ESG analysis is way more important than we could have imagined.”RBC’s findings were echoed in a report by BofA Global Research strategists led by Savita Subramanian. The report showed that since the Feb. 19 peak, stocks with ESG scores in the top quintile outperformed those that ranked poorly by five to 10 percentage points in the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, stocks with lower ESG scores were seeing bigger cuts to earnings forecasts. In Asia, BofA wrote, the phenomenon of ESG outperformance didn’t hold, partly because China and India outperformed Australia and Japan. That was partly because China, in particular, “has had better Covid-19 timing and containment,” the team pointed out.“ESG is a bear market necessity, not a bull market luxury,” BofA wrote, disputing recent critiques suggesting that in times of stress, investors and companies would allocate all resources to staying afloat, and that an ESG focus was a luxury.Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, says that it was possible that the push for companies to make ESG disclosures could slow down, particularly disclosure of “nitpicky” ESG factors. “But big issues like climate change will continue to resonate with investors,” and company disclosures about environmental practices will continue to proliferate, he says.Bud Sturmak, co-chief investment officer of Perigon Wealth Management, notes that sustainable investing is being “mainstreamed,” with ratings firms, central banks, insurers, and corporate lenders incorporating ESG risks into their assessments. “There is now a clear and direct line from a company’s ESG performance to cost of capital, profitability, and share-price volatility,” he says.Whatever the critiques, “the underpinnings of sustainable investing remain alive and well—despite the collapse in oil prices and the fact that many governments’ green growth agendas could be pushed back in time,” Sustainable Market Strategies wrote. “In fact, current market pricing of several ESG-relevant investment themes suggests that investors are still confident that the future will be a more sustainable one.”  Write to Leslie P.

1,"Coronavirus will hurt sales at two major credit-card companies—            Visa      and            Mastercard      —more than the companies currently expect, according to Piper Sandler. In recent weeks, both Mastercard (icker: MA) and Visa (V) reduced their March-quarter sales-growth forecasts by a few percentage points. Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat sees more downside. On Thursday, he reaffirmed his Neutral ratings for both companies, but lowered his Mastercard stock-price target to $292 from $332. Donat cut his Visa stock target to $197 from $204.“We now expect COVID-19 to have a more negative impact,” he wrote. “We now think that the revised outlooks for both companies are overly optimistic…However, with the virus spreading to Europe and North America, we now expect impacts not just on cross-border activity but also on domestic spending activity.”Visa shares were down 5.6% to $163.23 on Thursday, while Mastercard stock was down 6.7% to $251.62. Neither company immediately responded to a request for comment on the analyst report.The analyst said the current difficult market environment will also lower the valuation multiples investors are willing pay for the credit-card companies. “While we believe that the card networks deserve a significant market premium, we think that the introduction of intra-quarter revenue volatility could reduce their P/E multiples,” he wrote, referring to the ratio of stock prices to earnings.

0,"Lower merger and acquisition prices could be one positive byproduct of the stock market’s recent volatility.Oil fell more than 20% on Monday, after Saudi Arabia instigated a price war with Russia. This caused the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      and the        S&P 500      (SPX) to each plunge more than 7% Monday, causing the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading. The Dow ended up closing down 7.8% at 23,851, while the S&P 500 ended off 7.6% to 2,746.56.The volatility has caused some M&A and initial public offering deals to be put on hold, banking sources said. Warner Music Group and Cole Hann have opted to put their IPOs on ice, Reuters reported. Some transactions in India and Europe have been postponed, said Paul Aversano, managing director and global practice leader of Alvarez & Marsal’s global transaction advisory group. “We’re starting to see that here in the U.S.,” Aversano said Monday. In the first quarter, M&A for large deals was already slow, a middle market lender said. “A good number of big underwriting commitments by loan arrangers have been pushed off,” the person said. One private-equity executive of a middle market firm said “debt was shaky.” Valuations in health care are down across the sector, one banker said. “This could result in many sales processes being disrupted,” the banker said. Some portfolio companies, mainly industrial, are experiencing a slowdown due to supply chain issues, people said. Demand has become a problem. Coronavirus fears have caused many consumers to avoid travel, while concerts and conferences are being canceled. The travel and leisure space is also seeing deals canceled, Aversano said.Many private-equity firms last week assessed their portfolio companies, and worked with management teams to put Covid-19 plans in place, bankers said.            KKR      (KKR), for example, asked its portfolio companies recently to come up with scenarios on which assets were adversely impacted by the virus. The New York buyout shop has teams working around the clock and is in regular dialogue with companies providing support, guidance, and sharing best practices, a person familiar with the situation said. Not all is doom and gloom. Alvarez & Marsal is known for its restructuring business but it also has a global M&A practice. The New York firm saw “a bunch of new buy-side transactions” last week, Aversano said. On the sell side, the firm is seeing a healthy pipeline of transactions coming to market, he said. “That will likely change in the short term,” he said. One private-equity executive said the supply chain for his industrial portfolio company has improved since February.The coronavirus may also cause prices for M&A transactions to drop, Aversano said. For several years, the busy M&A market frequently saw companies sell for sky-high valuations. Strong software or fintech companies, before the virus, would often fetch high-teens multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda. For example,            Visa      (V) in January acquired Plaid for $5.3 billion, or nearly 50 times revenue.That may change now. Aversano said the average sell-side multiple before the coronavirus was 11.9 to 12 times Ebitda. This may drop to 9 or 10 times. “When you have all this volatility, people aren’t going to pay 12 times anymore,” he said. It will take some time, possibly six to nine months, before sellers accept the “new normal,” he said. This could lead to a pause in the M&A market as parties adjust to the less frothy market. “People have to realize what their companies are really worth,” he said.The major beneficiary of all this volatility? Private equity. The PE industry, including venture capital and fund-of-funds, is sitting on a $1.71 trillion war chest that it needs to put to work. “This correction or recession will create significant buying opportunities for private equity, which has a record amount of dry power,” Aversano said. “There’s also a very low interest rate environment.”“Personally, I’m thinking about buying some oil,” he said.

1,"Just weeks after agreeing to acquire Credit Karma for $7 billion,            Intuit      is considering buying another fintech firm, two people familiar with the matter said. Intuit (ticker: INTU) is “looking hard” at Finicity, which is up for sale, these people said. Other possible targets include Credit Sesame and NerdWallet. Finicity is expected to sell for $1 billion to $2 billion, while Credit Sesame could go for $500 million to $750 million. It’s unclear what NerdWallet might fetch. Intuit, the tax-software company known for QuickBooks and TurboTax, confirmed Feb. 24 that it was acquiring Credit Karma for $7.1 billion. The merger combines two companies that aim to solve the personal finance problems of consumers, a statement said. “We do not comment on speculations or rumors,” an Intuit spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions. Coronavirus-related volatility continued to weigh on the broad market Monday; Intuit’s shares dropped 4.3%, or $11.45, to $263.73 in morning trading. Market volatility has slowed down many transactions, with some expecting a drop in M&A valuations. This could mean a buying opportunity. “There is a lot of money on the sidelines and I would expect companies to take advantage,” a banker said. Finicity is a data aggregator; its Application Programming Interface, better known as API, is a software intermediary that lets two applications talk to each other. The Murray, Utah-based firm provides a suite of APIs that helps companies like            Experian      or Ellie Mae to authenticate and enroll customers. Finicity has raised some $80 million in funding, Crunchbase said. Investors include Experian Ventures, PitchBook said. The company is similar to Plaid, which            Visa      agreed to buy in January for $5.3 billion. Plaid’s APIs help users connect their bank accounts to finance apps and transfer money. The deal has led many to wonder which fintech would get sold next. Credit Sesame, which had been expected to go public later this year or in 2021, is a smaller version of Credit Karma. Launched in 2010, the Mountain View, Calif., company has been profitable since 2017, the company said. Like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame offers consumers unlimited free access to credit scores, as well as identity theft protection and savings recommendations. Credit Sesame has raised $120.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. That includes a $43 million round in August. Investors include Menlo Ventures, Inventus Capital, Globespan Capital, IA Capital Groups,            Symantec,      Capital One Ventures, and Stanford University.Some, however, doubted Credit Karma’s interest. “Credit Sesame is just like Credit Karma,” one private equity executive said. “Why would they want two?”Founded in 2009, NerdWallet aims to help users make better personal financial decisions. This includes picking a credit card, a personal loan or a mortgage. The San Francisco company has raised $105 million in funding through four rounds, Crunchbase said. Investors include IVP, Core Innovation Capital and Camelot Financial Capital Management. “It’s our company policy not to comment on speculation or rumors related to our business, our solutions or our markets,” Andy Capener, a Finicity spokesman, said in an emailed response to questions. Credit Sesame and NerdWallet could not be reached for comment.

All Rights ReservedInvestors have been grasping for some sort of framework by which to compare the market rout stoked by the coronavirus outbreak. On Monday, the 11th anniversary of the bull market, they got it: 2008. While it may not be a perfect comparison, strategists are now pointing to the deep downturn during 2008 for clues as to where the markets today will go—and warning value stocks may not be the place for a tactical shift. Instead, many prefer companies with strong balance sheets. Markets globally tumbled Monday, with coronavirus concerns exacerbated by Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war. The S&P 500 opened down 7%, briefly halting trade.As confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China tripled in the past week and the U.S. began grappling with how to deal with the outbreak, strategists started preparing for their worst-case scenarios to become the baseline, even as a lot remained unknown.For the most part, strategists aren’t looking to jump in yet for bargains. “We’re looking for 2008 levels of market fear to tell us the bottoming process has begun and we expect that window will be shorter than the financial crisis,” writes Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. In a note to clients, Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote that 2008 was a financial shock that hit demand whereas the coronavirus shock is one that is hitting both demand and supply and that means it is likely to play out differently. As a result, he expects a sharp economic hit that will play out more like a recession than a depression.• While the 2008 crisis created a deep recession and a slow recovery as both households and financial firms had to heal their balance sheets, the virus is likely to spark sharp drops in output in the affected economies over the next quarter but, as long as virus fades, activity should bounce back as supply constraints are eased. In other words, Shearing writes, expect a short, sharp shock.• Typically, fiscal and monetary stimulus work by boosting demand. But today, the problem lies with both supply and demand. Loans and subsidies to the hardest-hit companies—targeted, temporary and large fiscal support—could offset the shock and central bankers could ease credit troubles with cheap financing to banks to the worst-hit companies. But the speed of the recovery is predicated largely on how the virus spreads and life returns to normal, he notes.• Asset-price collapses have historically triggered severe depressions in the past. In 2008, high levels of leverage in the banking system and other vulnerabilities in the global financial system, such as a dependence on wholesale finance and short-term credit lines, magnified the situation, Shearing notes. The good news: Though debt levels are high, they are concentrated in the government rather than households and thus less risky and banks are better-capitalized. The pockets of vulnerabilities are not big enough to trigger a global crisis, Shearing says. • The biggest risk beyond the immediate coronavirus is likely what the Japanification of more of the developed economies means, where more countries get stuck in a rut of anemic growth and perpetually low interest rates. Interest-rate cuts made to combat this crisis could push more investors to reach for yield, eventually causing bubbles to inflate, thus sowing the seeds of the next major crisis, he warns.Shearing’s outlook is the kind that has investors rushing to find some safety. But most low-volatility stocks are trading at premiums that are making them unattractive to some. And while value stocks sometimes do well out of market routs, strategists aren’t so sure this time. Better positioned may be strong balance-sheet companies. In a note to clients, Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, co-head of portfolio strategy at Bernstein Research, gives two reasons it is hard to make a case for a tactical shift to value: The biggest value sectors are banks and energy—both of which face severe challenges as interest rates tumble, credit risks rise and oil prices plummet. Fraser-Jenkins says large-cap energy stocks could become a core part of an income strategy—but in the medium term rather than the short term. While many investors flock to low-volatility stock because they tend to do well as earnings growth turns negative, Fraser-Jenkins cautions that these stocks tend to reverse quickly as earnings growth bottoms. Plus, in the U.S., low-volatility stocks are expensive and highly linked to short-term bond-yield moves. With the quality of corporate credit at its lowest point in two decades and balance-sheet quality not priced into the stock market the way other quality measures are, Fraser-Jenkins favors stocks of companies with good balance-sheet quality. Plus, companies with strong balance sheets in the U.S. and Europe aren’t expensive, with relative valuations around the middle of their post-1997 historic range—a “relatively inexpensive entry point” for investors seeking protection from the market rout.Electronic Arts      (ticker: EA),            Alphabet      (GOOG),            Procter & Gamble      (PG),            Walmart      (WMT),            Biogen      (BIIB),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Visa      (V), and            Accenture      (ACN) are among the U.S. companies Bernstein listed as having a sector neutral low leverage and high credit ratings, as well as an Outperform rating.The lesson: Not everything that was “safe” last time will be this time around.

1,"Stocks tumbled Tuesday amid continuous fears over the spreading coronavirus outside of China, with a rate cut offering little to no support.The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      dropped 785.91 points, or 2.94%, to close at 25,917.41. The        S&P 500      lost 86.86 points, or 2.81%, to end at 3003.37, and the        Nasdaq Composite      tumbled 268.08 points, or 2.99%, to close at 8684.09.Responding to Covid-19’s perceived economic impact, the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by half point to a range between 1.00% and 1.25% on Tuesday morning. At the following press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is in active contact with other central banks and there might be more formal coordination moving forward.This is the first rate cut outside a scheduled meeting since October 2008, and the vote was unanimous. After a brief respite, all three major stock indexes closed in the red as investors doubt that the central bank can really curb the coronavirus’ damage by loosening monetary policy. Some on Wall Street think the cut indicated that the Fed sees a credible danger of a possible credit crisis for small and midsized businesses–and consequently, a recession.Following the rate cut, gold futures jumped more than 3% and U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply to record lows as investors moved out of stocks and into haven assets. The two-year Treasury yields dropped 10.1 basis points to settle at 0.723%, 10-year yields slipped 8 basis points to 1.005%, and 30-year bond yields slid 2.2 basis points to 1.622%. The 10-year yields even briefly dropped below 1% for the first time ever. Companies continued to cut guidance, citing coronavirus impact. Following rivalMastercard      (MA), credit-card giant            Visa      (V) cut its forecast for net revenue growth in the March-ended quarter by 2.5 to 3.5 percentage points from the initial projection, citing a sharp slowdown in its cross-border business, in particular, travel-related spending. The company said it does not believe this deteriorating trend has bottomed out yet. Chip makers            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and            Qorvo      (QRVO) also joined other tech companies to cut revenue guidance.Investors are also nervously watching the results from Democratic primary ballots in 14 states and one U.S. territory. Super Tuesday has typically been a strong indicator of the likely eventual nominee for the presidential election in November. More than one third of pledged delegates are up for grabs, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading candidates in the race, and others try to nab votes.

All Rights ReservedThe coronavirus outbreak is hitting credit-card spending and that trend has yet to hit bottom,            Visa       said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.Visa shares fell as the credit-card company cut its revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter.Visa stock (ticker: V) was down 2.5% to $187.59 Tuesday afternoon, while the        Dow Jones Industrial Average       was down 2.3%. The company’s shares are up 25% over the past 12 months, compared with a 7% for the        S&P 500       over the same period. The company said it had been monitoring the spread of the convoravirus, known as Covid-19, around the globe. So far, the most significant impact on its business from the virus has been a “sharp slowdown of our cross-border business, in particular travel related spending,” because of a drop-off in travel to and from Asia. “Cross-border growth rates have deteriorated week by week since the coronavirus outbreak in China, and trends through February 28, 2020 do not yet fully reflect the impact of the coronavirus spreading outside of Asia,” the company said. It expects the situation to get worse. “We anticipate that this deteriorating trend has not bottomed out yet.”The company said it now expects net revenue growth in the second fiscal quarter to be between 2.5 and 2.5 percentage points lower than it initially projected. CFO Vasant Prabhu had said on the company’s first-quarter conference call that it expected net revenue growth in the second quarter “to be in the low double digits and modestly better than the first quarter,” when net revenue growth came in at 10%.

0,"Three numbers to start your day:—that’s based on the companies that have reported so far. We’re almost done with fourth-quarter earnings season, but some major names are still left to report.Each earnings season, retailers tend to be among the last companies to go. Several release their results from the crucial holiday-period this week. They include            Target      (TGT) and Nordstrom (JWN) on Tuesday,            Dollar Tree      (DT) on Wednesday, and            Costco Wholesale      (COST) on Thursday.There are also plenty of earnings highlights among non-retail names.            Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)      goes on Tuesday. On Wednesday,            Campbell Soup      (CPB) and Zoom Video (ZM) report. And finally,            Kroger      (KR) releases its results on Thursday.On Friday it was up over 20% from its yield a week earlier. Plenty of dividend stocks are looking mighty attractive today, but there’s more to the story.The significantly higher yield isn’t because the oil giant just increased its payout. It’s a result of how far and fast Exxon’s stock (XOM) tumbled in last week’s market selloff.Remember, a stock’s dividend yield is its payout per share divided by its stock price. So when the denominator gets smaller, the calculated yield is larger.That’s exactly what happened to almost every dividend-paying stock last week. But if coronavirus disruptions force companies to cut their payouts as some investors fear, those high yields could disappear fast.Through those programs, the companies invested in about half of venture deals done last year—worth over $57 billion.SoftBank Group’s      (SFTBY) $100 billion Vision Fund is definitely the most famous example. But companies from            Starbucks      (SBUX), to            Toyota Motor      (TM), to State Farm all have venture divisions.They have several motivations to invest in venture deals. Some companies want to get in on hot new trends, like            Tyson Foods      ’ (TSN) investment in            Beyond Meat      (BYND). Others just want a look under the hood before acquiring outright—as            Visa      (V) did with fintech company Plaid. Finally, some companies look for products they can use to improve their own business—            JetBlue Airways      (JBLU) invested in an AI start-up to use their technology to improve its ticket pricing.

0,"Toast cemented its unicorn status Friday by raising $400 million in funding.The so-called F round of financing values Toast, which provides cloud-based restaurant software, at nearly $5 billion. New investors include TPG and Greenoaks Capital. Also taking part are Bessemer Venture Partners and Tiger Global Management with participation from Durable Capital Partners LP, TCV, funds and accounts advised by            T. Rowe Price Associates,      G Squared, Light Street Capital, and Alta Park Capital, as well as others.Toast has collected more than $850 million in funding, including the current $400 million. The Boston company has raised money every year since 2015, including $250 million in 2019, $115 million in 2018, $101 million in 2017, $30 million in 2016 and $3 million in 2015, according to CrunchBase.“We’ve been very fortunate to end up with some of the best investors on the planet,” Tim Barash, Toast’s CFO and chief business officer, told Barron’s. Toast needed only a “couple months” to complete the fundraising, which was launched in late 2019, he said. Toast didn’t use an outside investment bank to advise on the round. The $400 million capital raising comes roughly a month since Plaid’s $5.3 billion sale to            Visa      —a transaction that has prompted much speculation about which fintech will get sold next. Don’t count on Toast to be a merger target anytime soon. Barash said he doesn’t feel any pressure from the Plaid deal to take part in M&A. “There are no plans to sell in the foreseeable future,” he said. Instead, Toast wants to continue its domination of the $900 billion restaurant industry by providing hardware and software to improve the guest experience and conquer labor challenges. Launched in 2013, Toast’s point-of-sale software helps restaurants and bars process payments and streamline orders, according to Software Advice. Barash declined to disclose the company’s revenue but said it rose 109% in 2019. Toast employs 3,000 people spread across its offices in Boston; Chicago; Woburn, Mass.; Portland, Ore.; Omaha; and Dublin, Ireland. In July, the company acquired StratEx, a provider of human-resources and payroll software for restaurants.Barash reiterated Toast’s initial public offering plans to Barron’s. “We definitely see ourselves going public in the next few years or so,” he said, adding that the company is not in a rush for an IPO. “Long term, we expect to be a large independent public company,” Barash said. Toast is looking to hire. The company may add as many as 1,000 employees this year across various segments, including sales, operations, and research and development, Barash said. TPG’s investment in Toast is coming from its TPG Tech Adjacencies fund, which closed on $1.6 billion in May. The pool provides flexible capital for growing tech companies that choose to stay private longer. “Toast is providing restaurants of all sizes with a comprehensive software platform that enables them to run their businesses more effectively, efficiently, and creatively, leading to a better experience for diners everywhere,” said Arun Agarwal, of TPG, in a statement.

0,"AffiniPay, a payments company, looks like it will continue to be backed by private equity.TA Associates has won an auction for the firm, five people familiar with the matter said. Barron’s reported in December that the business, which produces $30 million a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was up for sale. The company was expected to sell for 20 times Ebitda, Barron’s said in December. Raymond James was advising on the auction. Amy Porter founded AffiniPay in 2005. The Austin, Texas, company provides payments technology for specific industries such as law and accounting. It processes more than $6 billion annually for more than 60,000 users, including the Alabama State Bar, the Louisiana State Bar and the ASPCA. In June, Porter, who was AffiniPay’s CEO, became executive chairman. Tom West took over as CEO, a statement said at the time.Payments companies, which typically process transactions between merchants and customers, have emerged as one of the hottest sectors in financial technology. Last year saw several large payments transactions:            Global Payments      (ticker: GPN) bought TSYS for $21.5 billion,            Fiserv      (FISV) acquired First Data for $22 billion, and            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS) snapped up WorldPay in a $35 billion deal.            Mastercard      (MA) bought Nets for $3.19 billion in August.More recently,            Visa      (V) agreed in January to buy Plaid for $5.3 billion. Plaid isn’t a payments company but provides the technology to enable consumer payments.TA, of Boston, is a longtime investor in payments companies. The private-equity firm acquired BluePay, a payment processor for merchants, in 2013. Four years later, in 2017, it sold BluePay to First Data for $760 million. TA also invested in BillDesk, an Indian payments company, in 2012, and in Financial Information Technologies, which provides invoicing and electronic payments to alcoholic beverage retailers and distributors, in 2018. Last year, TA’s 13th flagship fund raised $8.5 billion. Great Hill, which sold its stake in AffiniPay, invested in the company in 2015. The private-equity firm recently acquired a majority of One Inc., an insurance payments provider,Barron’s reported Feb. 20. Great Hill is investing out of its seventh growth buyout fund, which closed on $2.5 billion in July.

0,"Add servers and personal computers to the list of things that everyone is clamoring to buy in the age of coronavirus.On Wednesday, memory chip maker            Micron Technology      (ticker: MU) reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter, one of the first companies to post financial results for a quarter that includes the onset of the current pandemic and the associated downturn. And the company did just fine. For the quarter ended Feb. 27, Micron posted revenue of $4.8 billion, down 17.8% from $5.84 billion a year ago, but at the high end of the company’s guidance range of $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion, and above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Non-GAAP profits were 45 cents a share, 10 cents above guidance and ahead of the Street’s 37 cents. For the May quarter, Micron sees revenue of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion, with non-GAAP profits of 55 cents a share, give or take 15 cents. Street consensus has been for $4.9 billion in revenue and earnings of 54 cents a share. The quarter was a complicated one, and the outlook no less so. As the big year-over-year revenue drop illustrates, recent quarters have been rough on the memory business, with prices of both DRAM and NAND under pressure. But there has been widespread anticipation of a pickup in pricing on both memory varieties in 2020 and beyond. That’s still in the cards, but there are complications on both the supply and demand sides of the equation. One key update from the Micron call was the company is seeing strong demand both from both the cloud data center sector and for personal computers—trends which are consistent with the new reality that many people are working from home, but need to connect to servers to get work done. That shift has lifted the market’s sentiment on the entire PC and server hardware complex. PC makers            Apple      (AAPL), Dell (DELL) and            HP      (HPQ); disk-drive companies            Western Digital      (WDC) and            Seagate      (STX); microprocessor companies            Intel      (INTC) and            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)      ; and high-end server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) were all showing gains on Thursday.BofA Global Research analyst Simon Woo upped his rating on Micron by two notches to Buy from Underperform on Thursday, setting a $60 price target. The company, he contends, has new growth opportunities in the age of Covid-19, in particular in the data center sector. Other Street commentary highlighted the growth opportunities in servers and PCs, though there’s some concern the company’s May quarter guidance might be a little aggressive, given the uncertainty in the global economy and the tech supply chain.UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri repeated a Buy rating, with a new target of $70, down from $75. “The bear would argue there is risk to the guidance as 1) nothing is immune in a demand shock, and 2) data center strength is simply hyperscalers building inventory,” he writes. “We do worry about the first risk, but the new work-from-home economy is also creating new pockets of demand in areas like PC and, of course data center compute.”Deutsche Bank’s      Sidney Ho maintained his Buy rating, but cut his target to $60, from $65. “Post results, we are encouraged by Micron’s execution so far, but acknowledge that uncertainties remain high as governments globally determine how to combat the public health crisis,” he writes. But he adds with the stock trading at 1.3 times current book value (compared with a historical average of 1.7 times) “the risk-reward profile remains favorable.”Not everyone is convinced.Nomura’s David Wong is keeping his Neutral rating on the stock. While he writes in a research note that February results were strong, he notes that Micron said “it is unclear as to the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID-19 supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand.” He sees “substantial risk that the economic fallout of the virus issues could result in substantial end market demand weakness as the year progresses, pressuring memory prices.”Citi’s Christopher Danely maintains a Sell rating on the stock, cuts his target to $35, from $38. “Although Micron continues its pattern of higher cycle to cycle margins and EPS, we believe the guidance is too aggressive given our belief in a recession,” he writes. Micron stock was up 5.1%, to $44.65 in recent Thursday trading. Write to Eric J.

0," Wall Street started out the week wildly bullish: Analysts upgraded 41 stocks Monday and downgraded only 6, marking the most upgrades in one day over the past 30 days, according to data aggregated by Bloomberg and examined by Barron’s. It is also the most net upgrades in one day over the past month, at 35. Net ratings changes, of course, are the number of upgrades minus the number of downgrades. The question now is what this means for investors. Is this a buying signal for the wary—a sign that stocks are cheap enough after the coronavirus selloff? Or is it just one random data point that investors can safely ignore? The truth—as is often the case—lies in the middle. Stock valuations have come down significantly, making the market look more attractive. But uncertainty still reigns. The coronavirus selloff has been swift and brutal. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      dropped 12.4% last week. The        S&P 500      fell 11.5%. Both indexes entered correction territory, defined as a drop of 10% from recent highs. It was the fastest the S&P 500 has ever entered a correction from an all-time high, according to Dow Jones Market data. The steep selloff has taken the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P from about 19 times estimated 2020 earnings to about 17 times estimated earnings. Nineteen times is almost 20% higher than historical averages. Seventeen times is close to what Wall Street considers normal these days. It is hard to say if recent declines catalyzed the ratings actions. For starters, there are more ratings changes on a Monday than on the average day. Analysts, after all, have all weekend to ponder what has transpired recently. And analysts, over recent weeks, have tended to be a little more bullish on Monday than the rest of the week, data shows. But Wall Street analysts, overall, have been more bearish lately, which makes Monday’s data point a little more relevant. There have been about 10% more downgrades than upgrades over the past month. Over time upgrades and downgrades, in aggregate, should be just about balanced. The negative bias lately signals that analysts were feeling a little concerned over valuation. The upgrade and downgrade numbers are, of course, an aggregation., and look down on the market from a great height. The aggregation doesn’t say anything about why things are being upgraded or what sectors are falling in or out of favor. Energy shares, for instance, have gotten hit harder during the recent selloff because oil prices are falling. Benchmark crude prices are down more than 20% year to date. That hurts sentiment for even the most bullish energy analysts. There was one energy upgrade Monday.            Goldman Sachs      upgraded oil refiner            HollyFrontier      (HFC) from the equivalent of Sell to Hold. Shares are down 35% year to date. As a refiner, the company’s earnings are more about energy spreads—such as the difference between oil and gasoline prices—and less about the absolute level of crude. But it’s difficult to divine a bigger takeaway about energy from Monday’s upgrade figures. There were a lot of technology upgrades Monday too. Tech stocks have been beaten up because of exposure to China, where a lot of semiconductors and electronics are built and assembled. Baird, for instance, upgraded            Micron Technology      (MU)to the equivalent of Hold from Sell and upgraded            Western Digital      (WDC) to the equivalent of Buy from Hold. Both shares have been affected by coronavirus fears. Western Digital stock is down about 16% from recent highs. Micron shares have fallen 10% recently. Baird, apparently, sees opportunity after the selloff. There are a million ways to slice and dice any data set, including upgrades and downgrades. Monday’s slew of ratings changes is worth examining because it’s an outlier. And for the broader market, it’s a good—albeit small—sign that some analysts are seeing more opportunity, while the rest of the market sees fear.

All Rights ReservedWestern Digital’s      stock is trading higher after a pair of analyst upgrades. They follow a recent selloff in the shares of the disk-drive and NAND memory chip company.Amid concerns about the impact on the tech supply chain from coronavirus, shares of Western Digital (ticker: WDC) had their own private bear market, falling 21% from Feb. 12 through Friday, while shares of rival            Seagate      Technology (STX) fell 15% over the same span.Stifel analyst Patrick Ho has lifted his rating on Western Digital shares to Buy from Hold, with a new price target of $73, up from $63. “While we clearly acknowledge that the current coronavirus situation could impact near-term estimates, we believe our fundamental outlook for 2020 remains intact,” Ho wrote in a research note issued over the weekend. Ho is in the camp that says the virus issue is simply pushing out demand for mobile phones, PCs, and other tech goods—not destroying it. “We believe the entire electronics ecosystem continues to experience levels of supply constraints, which could push out demand by a quarter or more,” he said. “We believe structurally, demand has not changed but the ability to produce products can impact the ability to meet near-term demand.”He added that “current tightness in the flash memory market is likely only to intensify as the supply chain gets further constrained in the near term. This will benefit the industry, as well as Western Digital if the supply tightness intensifies further.”Baird analyst Tristan Gerra lifted his ratings on Monday for Western Digital, Seagate, and            Micron Technology      (MU). He went to Outperform from Underperform on Western Digital, to Outperform from Neutral on Seagate and to Neutral from Underperform on Micron. His prices targets moved up to $75 from $60 on Western Digital, to $60 from $54 on Seagate, and to $55 from $45 on Micron.Gerra wrote that the outlook for both NAND and DRAM memory chip pricing looks positive for 2020 despite current demand weakness in China. Pricing will “remain resilient” throughout the year, and memory demand from server manufacturers remains strong, he says. And he thinks that stimulus plans in China “could drive a second-half demand rebound” for smartphones and PCs.He adds that Western Digital should benefit from improved product mix in hard disk drives and continued strength in data centers. And he thinks Seagate can gain market share, driven by demand for the company’s new 16 TB disk drives. He notes, though that “near term, supply chain disruption and weak demand in China for consumer segments such as PCs and surveillance cameras should negatively impact hard disk drive revenue, utilization rates, and gross margin, partially offset by initial signs of a rebound in the China server market and continued strength in the U.S. data center market.”WD shares bounced back on Monday, rising 5%, to $58.33. Seagate was up 2.3%, to $49.06, while Micron was up 1.8%, to $53.49. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedThe Wuhan coronavirus has infected nearly 10,000 people in China and killed 213. To contain the outbreak, national holidays were extended, stores were closed, public events were canceled, and travel plans and movie screenings were delayed. The economic repercussions can’t be ignored, and are reflected in the falling stock prices around global markets. Stock markets in China were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, but trading in exchange-traded funds continued.        iShares MSCI China      (ticker: MCHI) has declined 11% since Jan. 17, while        iShares MSCI World      (URTH) and        iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted      (EUSA) have both lost more than 3%.During the SARS epidemic in 2003, China’s gross-domestic-product growth fell to 0.8% in the second quarter of 2003 from 2.9% in the first quarter, before bouncing back to 3.7% in the third quarter. Retail sales fell 4%, and air-passenger traffic plunged by 70%-80% for tourist-heavy economies such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, according to Robert Buckland, an equity strategist at Citigroup. Read Next: Sports Gambling Will Be a Huge Opportunity. Bet on These Stocks. Asian stocks were hit the hardest and continued to sell off in March 2003, even as markets elsewhere recovered. Indeed, Asian equities didn’t bottom out until new cases of infection peaked in late April. Cyclical sectors sold off the most, while defensives held up better. Some of the hardest-hit industries included airlines, hotels, restaurants, and banks.We should see a similar pattern this time. Citigroup economist Li-Gang Liu expects China’s GDP growth to slow down to 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020, and has cut his forecast for the full year to 5.5% from 5.8%. The outbreak is expected to peak in March, Citi strategists estimate, and Asian equity markets are likely to keep falling until there are signs infections are leveling out.Yet a China slowdown this time around will have a much bigger impact on the world economy than during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The Chinese economy made up only 4% of global GDP back then. Now, it is 17%.In the U.S., the coronavirus outbreak comes when stocks have been rallying for most of the past year and hitting new highs. According to a market sentiment indicator from Citigroup chief U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich, the U.S. market has entered euphoric territory and investors should exercise some short-term caution.The stock market was already due for a pause, and the coronavirus has proven to be the catalyst. Some might worry that the latest dip could mark the beginning of the next major bear market, but Citi’s economists think it’s still too early to make the call. Out of the bank’s 18 economic indicators, only five have turned red—the most for the current cycle, but still not enough to make a bearish call.Instead, the coronavirus-triggered selloff might present a good opportunity to buy the dip. Global equities will likely track the growth of earnings to post about a 4% gain in 2020, according to Buckland, and that means any further drop in prices would make expected returns more attractive.Buckland argues that it might be time to hunt for some bargains. His team has put together a list of large-cap developed-markets stocks that generate at least 15% of their sales from China. Stocks in the list, including 25 U.S., 19 European, and 16 Japanese companies, performed strongly in 2019, rallying 36.6% for the year as the MSCI World benchmark gained 25.2%. They have recently underperformed, falling 4.6% since Jan. 17. These stocks could be vulnerable if worries around the coronavirus and Chinese economy escalate, and should remain under pressure until the outbreak is brought under control. That makes them a good buy. Many of the listed names are in the semiconductors, autos, and tech hardware sector, including            Apple      (ticker: AAPL),            Intel      (INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            TE Connectivity      (TEL), and            Western Digital      (WDC).

0,"Morgan Stanley      is getting more optimistic over memory chip demand and now says there is more share price upside for            Micron Technology      and            Western Digital.Micron (ticker: MU) is a leader in the DRAM and NAND semiconductor markets. DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is used in desktop computers, mobile phones, and servers, while NAND is flash memory used in smartphones and solid-state hard drives. Western Digital (WDC) is another maker of NAND flash memory and manufactures mechanical hard drives. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore raised his ratings for both Micron and Western Digital to Overweight from Equal-weight.Our “channel checks make it clearer that customers are building real conviction that memory will tighten more demand versus supply over the course of 2020, which is leading them to put more inventory into place,” he wrote. “We see DRAM as a gradual bottoming process, but see Micron rerating, while we see NAND/Western Digital in more of a classical cycle bottom that looks more V shaped than we thought a month ago.”Micron stock was up 0.5% to $59.47 on Thursday, while Western Digital rose 2.7% to $70.47.The analyst estimates NAND flash memory prices will rise as much as 10% in the March quarter, driven by anticipation of the next-generation videogame console launches later this year. He also predicts DRAM prices will likely rise over the next six months. “We expect DRAM pricing to inflect in 2020 as inventories normalize and demand returns,” he wrote.Moore increased his price target for Micron stock to $73 from $56 and raised his forecast for Western Digital shares to $88 from $64.Other Wall Street analysts are generally bullish on Micron, with 74% having a Buy or Overweight rating on the company, according to FactSet. The average analyst price target for the stock is $65.58.Investors may want to assess how much of a recovery is already priced into the shares of chip companies. Micron and Western Digital have risen about 33% and 22%, respectively, over the last three months due to anticipation of a semiconductor industry turnaround.

1,"Everyone loves a comeback story. Especially investors.To identify the stock market’s best 2019 comebacks, Barron’s ranked the companies in the        S&P 500      index by their 2018 and 2019 price changes. We then calculated the difference in the price changes to come up with the best improvements. It’s worth noting that a stock that falls 50% one year, needs to gain 100% in the following year to reach break-even.Lam Research      (ticker: LRCX) topped the list. It soared 117% in 2019, following a 26% decline in 2018, for a delta of 143 percentage points.Chips and chip equipment makers dominate the list of comeback stocks, reflecting what bulls think will be an upturn in memory chip demand starting in 2020. Investors are hoping that 5G wireless services will drive an uptick in mobile phone sales, along with a pickup in chip demand from public cloud companies. Here’s a list of the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with the most dramatic reversals of fortune. (The data reflect the stocks’ closing prices on Dec. 26.) Lam Research (LRCX)  Price change, by year  2018: -26%,  2019: +117%  Lam’s rebound was part of a broad 2019 recovery in companies that make chip manufacturing hardware. Lam expects to see a pickup in spending on memory chip manufacturing in 2020 and beyond, with continued stable demand from logic chip companies and contract chip manufacturers. Over the last two years combined, Lam stock is up 59%.Coty (COTY)  2018: -67%  2019: +67%  In July,            Coty      announced a turnaround plan intended to “drive substantial improvement” in its consumer beauty business while deleveraging and improving profitability. In November, the company announced a deal to buy a 51% stake in Kylie Jenner’s company Kylie Cosmetics for $600 million. Coty is still down 45% over the last two years. Western Digital (WDC)  2018 -54%  2019 +70%  With the 2015 acquisition of SanDisk,            Western Digital      has become a bet on memory chips—with both DRAM and NAND memories expected to show better pricing and improved demand in 2020 and beyond. The stock is down 22% over the last two years.Applied Materials      (AMAT)  2018 -36%  2019 +87%  Like Lam, Applied is benefiting from anticipation of improving demand for chip making gear. On the company’s most recent earnings conference call, CFO Daniel Durn said that “while it’s always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it’s a matter of when, not if.” Shares are up 19% over the last two years.Arconic (ARNC)  2018 -38%  2019 +85%  The specialty metals company, spun off from            Alcoa      (AA) three years ago, rejected a buyout offer from Apollo Global Management in January. Instead, the company has filed with the SEC to split in two, with one company focused on aerospace and the other on autos—a move investors expect to unlock value for shareholders. Arconic shares are up 14% over the last two years.Xerox Holdings      (XRX):  2018 -32%  2019 +90%  Xerox shares have gotten a boost from the company’s aggressive cost-cutting moves, as well as its decision to sell its long held joint venture in Japan with Fujifilm. In recent weeks, the focus has shifted to the company’s bold unsolicited bid for            HP      (HPQ). Xerox is up 28% over the last two years.Fortune Brands Home & Security      (FBHS)  2018 -44%  2019 +72%  Fortune makes cabinets, plumbing supplies, and other home building wares. While the company said in reporting third-quarter results that the market had been slower than expected, it also said that there was a pickup in demand in September and October from both the new construction and home repair markets. Starting in January, President and COO Nicholas Fink becomes CEO, taking over for Christopher Klein, who is retiring. The stock is down 4% over the last two years.KLA (KLAC)  2018 -15%,  2019 +100%  The semiconductor capital equipment firm is seeing good demand from the logic chip sector, and it sees broad trends driving growth in 2020 and beyond. CEO Rick Wallace said on the company’s latest conference call that “the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence growing semiconductor investment in China, and continued device and process innovation.”            KLA      shares are up 69% over the last two years. Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS)  2018 -29%  2019 +82%  Skyworks makes radio chips for mobile phones, which are expected to see accelerating demand in 2020 with the arrival of the first 5G handsets. The stock is up 27% over the last two years.General Electric      (GE)  2018 -57%  2019 +54%  After a disastrous 2018, GE shares are showing signs of life. Investors seem to have gained confidence that GE has gotten a grip on its operating issues. Bulls expect improvements ahead at GE Power, continued solid performance at GE Healthcare, and growth in aircraft leasing. That said, its aircraft engine business remains vulnerable to the continued troubles with            Boeing’s      737 Max aircraft. GE shares are still down 33% over the last two years.

In addition, he forecasts gaming consoles from            Microsoft      and            Sony      that will be launched in late 2020 will have a terabyte of flash-memory storage. The prior consoles primarily used traditional hard drives for game storage. Hosseini raised his price target for Western Digital shares to $90 from $55.Other Wall Street analysts are mixed on Western Digital. About 52% have ratings of Buy or the equivalent on the stock, while 39% have Hold ratings, according to FactSet. Their average price target for the stock is $62.31.While there is little doubt that 5G phones and the new 2020 gaming consoles will add to demand for flash memory, investors should be less confident about the company’s other businesses: PC hard drives and enterprise storage.

All Rights ReservedMicron Technology      shares were trading higher Monday morning after Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini lifted his rating to Positive from Neutral and raised his price target on the stock to $85 from $45, anticipating a strong recovery in the supply-and-demand balance for memory chips in 2020 and 2021.On a similar basis, he also raised his rating on            Western Digital       (ticker: WDC) to Positive from Neutral, lifting his target to $90, from $55.For Micron’s (MU) 2020 fiscal year ending in August, Hosseini actually trimmed his earnings-per-share forecast to reflect near-term pricing trends, and sits well below his analyst peers. But he thinks a turn will start with the quarter ending in May and will continue from there, leading him to be well above consensus for fiscal year 2021. He cut his fiscal year 2020 EPS forecast to $1.95 from $2.07, but raised his 2021 forecast to $6.56 from $5.97. And he said Micron has “earnings power” in the $8 to $10 a share range. Street consensus estimates call for profit of $2.44 a share this year and $5.29 next year.Micron will report results for its fiscal first quarter ended in November on Wednesday after the close of trading. Hosseini thinks profit will be in line with the Wall Street consensus at around 95 cents a share. But he said he sees improving fundamentals ahead, with EPS likely to hit bottom in the current quarter.Hosseini thinks the company will benefit in coming quarters from improving economics for both DRAM and NAND memory chips. DRAM is used in personal computers, workstations and servers. NAND chips are used in smartphones and solid-state drives.For DRAM, he thinks average selling prices will be down in the low teens quarter over quarter for the first quarter, with a mid-single-digit decline in the current quarter ending in February, and then show a 3% to 5% quarter-over-quarter increase from there. He sees the company’s gross margin in DRAM troughing in the low 30% range in the February quarter before rebounding to the high 40s by the end of fiscal year 2020 and into the 50s in 2021. “We expect DRAM bit demand growth in 2020 to reach 20%-plus, driven by smartphone bit demand growth of 25%-30%, and exceeding supply bit growth of midteens,” he wrote in a separate note on the outlook for chip demand.For NAND, he expects a low single-digit slide in pricing in the fiscal first quarter, with a similar decline in the current quarter. He sees NAND gross margins troughing in the current quarter, with gradual improvement into the 20s in fiscal year 2020. Investors will need to wait for 2021 to see a meaningful recovery in the 30s or 40s, he wrote. The analyst expects NAND bit demand growth in 2020 to reach 30% to 35%, exceeding supply growth of 25% to 30%.Micron stock was up 4.6% to $53.57 Monday morning.

0,"Consumers and companies alike are generating data at an astonishing rate, and you might think that this would be a great time to invest in disk-drive stocks. But Stifel analyst Patrick Ho advises proceeding with caution.This morning, Ho picked up coverage of the dominant disk-drive companies,            Seagate Technology      (STX) and            Western Digital      (WDC) with Hold ratings. He set targets of $62 on Seagate and $53 on Western Digital, slightly above recent prices for both. Read Barron’s Recent Cover Story: Tech’s Pioneers Have Been Left Behind. Their Stocks Are Cheap—and Complicated.Ho is more bullish about the fundamentals at Seagate, but finds the valuation of both stocks challenging at current levels.Ho writes in a research note that his Western Digital target price reflects a multiple of 1.3 times enterprise value to projected fiscal 2021 sales, in line with the stock’s average multiple over the past five years. He sees some potential tailwinds for the stock — including an anticipated rebound in NAND flash pricing and a pickup in hard drive demand — but adds that fundamental questions reduce his enthusiasm for both Western Digital and Seagate.“While we believe market dynamics in both HDD hard disk drives and NAND are improving, we also believe Western Digital lags somewhat in both on the technology front,” Ho writes. “We believe technology helps differentiate companies, and we will monitor how Western Digital responds to the changing needs of its customer bases.He adds that he has questions about the company’s capital structure, with a high debt load that could reduce future flexibility.For Seagate stock, Ho’s stock target reflects a 1.8x multiple of estimated fiscal 2021 revenue, which would match the company’s five-year peak valuation. But he cautions that “valuation upside is somewhat limited near term, given the stock’s strong run in 2019,” with a 55% gain year to date. That said, Ho sees some favorable near-term and long-term market dynamics for Seagate. “Near term, we believe a recovery in data center spending is transpiring, and this is likely to carry into 2020, driving potential upside to estimates,” he writes. “Long term, we believe the emergence of a ‘big data’ economy and the emergence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other market needs will help drive HDD sales.” He adds that “the cost effectiveness and data-intensive needs for various data centers still make HDDs a very attractive ‘big data’ storage alternative, and we believe Seagate has a technology roadmap to meet these needs.”He notes that a key differentiator for Seagate is its HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) technology, which the company intends to use to boost its highest capacity drives from 16 terabytes today to 50 terabytes by 2026. “We are favorably biased on a fundamental basis on Seagate, but admittedly, we are seeking a better entry point into the name at current prices.”Both Western Digital and Seagate are trading fractionally higher early Monday.

1,"Few companies seem more American than            Facebook,      with its brat-genius corporate persona and consuming drive to sell advertising. But plans for the Facebook-backed global virtual currency Libra, a next really big thing if it works, tilt the House of Zuckerberg’s future further toward emerging markets.About two-thirds of Facebook’s (ticker: FB) some 2.3 billion active users are now in the developing world, and that doesn’t count WhatsApp, which has become “a utility” for a billion more, reckons Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The problem is these devoted masses produce little revenue. Facebook takes in 10 times as much per user in the U.S. and Canada as in Asia.Libra could offer a solution. Whether developed markets really need a new global electronic coin is debatable. But Libra is poised to catch a wave in emerging markets, which are leapfrogging at a breakneck pace from cash under the mattress to settlements via mobile device. The payments market in India, for instance, is growing by 60% a year, says Harshita Rawat, who covers the sector for AB Bernstein. International transfers in the developing world are huge, yet woefully inefficient. Personal remittances jumped to a record $529 billion last year, according to the World Bank. The leading vehicle for them is            Western Union      (WU), which can gobble commissions of 10% or more. The advantage of one-click transfers through WhatsApp, with Libra’s presumed economies of scale, is easy to see.Facebook also has an example to follow within emerging markets: Chinese social-media champion            Tencent Holdings      (700.Hong Kong), which has built its            WeChat      social network into a “super-app,” where users can buy anything from video games to automobiles and pay for them with WeChat Pay. “Libra has WeChat as a model, but can make the network global and bring down the cost with blockchain technology,” says Gil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson. “This is not a small thing.” Libra is envisioned as a stand-alone consortium that combines Facebook’s customer reach with the leading incumbent payments processors—            Visa      (V),            Mastercard      (MA), and             Paypal Holdings      (PYPL)—and global-reach vendors like            Uber Technologies      (UBER) and cellular provider            Vodafone      Group (VOD). Investors seem to like the idea so far; Facebook shares soared 18% in June. “This is a potential watershed moment for the company, unlocking revenue streams aside from advertising,” Mahaney says.Bernstein’s Rawat is less ecstatic. Libra’s big-tent structure—it ultimately aims for 100 members—will make governance and decision-making clumsy, she warns. And potential blockchain competitors aren’t sleeping, from big banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to Boston-based peer-to-peer network Circle. But the biggest challenge is regulation, as Libra moves to integrate its supercoin with old-school fiat banking systems. A number of populous emerging markets, like Indonesia and Bangladesh, flatly ban cryptocurrencies. So does China, which in any case is saturated by WeChat and competitor Alipay. In India, the biggest remaining market to play for, virtual money is legal but “not recognized as legal tender,” according to the finance minister. Against this background, an existing initiative to enable payments via WhatsApp has been stuck in the beta phase for the past two years, Rawat says. Central banks will be forced to accommodate the tide of demand for virtual global payments, Luria thinks. “Regulation should be the least of Libra’s concerns,” he says. Whoever is right, the Libra launch reinforces some home truths about the medium-term future: Emerging markets will continue to dominate global growth, and increasingly be the platform for innovation.

1,"Mastercard      (ticker: MA) and            Visa      (V) are working to extend their cross-border money-transfer capabilities into peer-to-peer transfers, KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani said in a note to clients Monday. Mastercard shares were up about 1.7% at $225.58 in recent trading, with Visa rising nearly 2% to $150.25.  The back story. Mastercard said on Friday that it was withdrawing its offer to acquire          Earthport      (EPO.UK), a United Kingdom payments company that was the subject of a bidding war between Mastercard and Visa. Mastercard said it was dropping out because a low number of Earthport shareholders had accepted its offer. That clears the way for Visa to acquire Earthport, and separately, Mastercard said it would acquire Transfast, another cross-border payments company. (Visa declined to comment.)  What’s new. “MA’s acquisition of Transfast and V’s potential acquisition of Earthport help further the companies’ strategies to broaden their focus and capture additional payments flows related to cross-border B2B payments,” Sakhrani wrote. “When closed, these acquisitions will provide V and MA direct connectivity and reach into bank accounts and ACH networks on a global basis.”That means that each payment company will have a better ability to generate revenue from sources other than their traditional card processing businesses.  Looking ahead. There has been a significant amount of disruption in the cross-border payments space in recent years. Longtime leader            Western Union      (WU) has seen products like            PayPal Holdings      ’ (PYPL) Venmo and Xoom take significant market share. Sakhrani notes that potential moves by Mastercard and Visa are a sign that card processors want to get into the P2P money-transfer business too.

The biggest blockchain story of the last year or so—other than a plethora of ICO scams and bitcoin crashing about 67% from its $19,783 December 2017 high—has been the steady stream of powerful mainstream figures and companies who have declared blockchain is the next big thing for...something.In that context, it seems almost a given that after leaving the Trump White House to spend more time driving his Tesla and playing golf in the Hamptons, Gary Cohn would pop up next doing blockchain...something. And so he has. As reported by the Financial Times, the former            Goldman Sachs      chief operating officer has become an advisor to Spring Labs, which is building a way to use blockchain to share consumer credit data among banks. Also advising Spring Labs: the former head of the FDIC, the former head of McKinsey’s financial institutions practice, a former deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the former president and COO of Oracle, the founder of Victory Park Capital, and so on.It’s not a group of anarcho-capitalists with Tor browsers and a passion for anonymized purchases of guns and hallucinogens.And that makes total sense: If you’re selling what you hope is going to be the next generation of back-office bank software, you don’t bring Julian Assange on board.Blockchain’s future, the new story seems to go, is about being boring. Everyone knows what the cool cryptocurrencies are good for. The question people like Gary Cohn are trying to answer is what exactly boring blockchain is for.If you haven’t already, read my piece from last week’s magazine on            Western Union’s      push into a digital business.Goldman Sachs Is Looking to Reduce Marcus Lending Goal on Credit Caution, Bloomberg reported.Civil, the blockchain-based journalism project, has an update on its ICO and things look bleak: It has sold just $1.34 million of its $8 million goal, with a single buyer accounting for $1.1 million.FT Alphaville’s Jemina Kelly takes a detailed look at Civil’s structure.

0," Bobbing for Basis Points. After two consecutive down days, all three major benchmark indexes are in the black, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the charge. All eyes are on September’s meeting of the Federal Reserve committee that sets interest rates, though an increase is all but certain. Stocks could swoon nevertheless. In today’s Intraday Update, we…  •…lay out what analysts expect from Wednesday’s Fed meeting;  •…explain why stocks might stumble later this afternoon;  •…and watch Airbus (EADSY) take off on reports of a potential $18 billion jet order from China.  Fed Day Expectations Wednesday’s Fed meeting is expected to be market neutral, but stocks didn’t get that memo. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 0.3% to 26,557.61, the S&P 500 has gained 0.3% to 2923.53, and the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 0.3% to 8036.47. The Fed is expected to raise rates for the third time in 2018 by 0.25 percentage point, or 25 basis points. A fourth increase, in December, is also widely anticipated, in addition to another four hikes next year. “Our team expects Jerome Powell to highlight the growing upside risks to the economic backdrop, downplay the potential impact of tariffs on the economy, and dodge any questions on the politicization of the Fed,” writes Lori Calvasina, equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Given investors’ expectations, Calvasina sees stocks shrugging off the hike, but says investors might experience “short-term indigestion” if the Fed takes a more aggressive line on the years ahead than anticipated. One dissenting view holds that stocks could stumble later this afternoon, but not because of the Fed. “Today marks the T+2 settlement day for September,” says Jeremy Klein of FBN Securities. “The significant outperformance of the S&P 500 versus the 10-Year Treasury will force many large institutions to dump equities in favor of fixed income.” Trades on Wall Street settle two business days after they go through, meaning Wednesday’s transactions are the last ones that will count toward institutions’ September performance. Selling stocks now would let institutions keep their asset allocations within the limits they have promised to investors. If a dip materializes, it may not last very long. October and third-quarter earnings season are just around the corner.

Every week, our finance & technology email will sort through the useful and the useless in fintech news and deliver it right to your inbox on Fridays. Sign up here.  Beyond untraceable drug and firearm purchases, one of the great promises made by blockchain evangelists is cheaper and easier remittances.As is so often the case with blockchain, the hype has come before the real use case, Khalid Fellahi, who is responsible for            Western Union’s      digital business, tells Barron’s. The company’s customers can initiate fully digital remittances in about 45 countries, Fellahi says. Its fully digital remittance business is growing around 20% a quarter.“We are a company that provides what we call the first mile, the last mile, and whatever happens in the middle to make a money transfer effective and secure and fast,” he says. “That’s what Western Union was built to do.”The question then is what blockchain, or bitcoin specifically, can do to make any of those three segments of the money’s journey from the developed to the developing world faster, more secure or cheaper. Fellahi’s answer is that for now, not much.In the middle, there is Western Union’s settlement system that works across 135 currencies but also, crucially, makes sure the sending and receiving entities are known entities and in compliance with anti-money laundering and other measures. “We make sure these transactions are safe, that we know who is transacting and we understand their behavior,” Fellahi says. “It sounds simple...but it’s actually a lot.”Cryptocurrency, viewed as a currency, doesn’t really help with that process right now. There’s no real benefit globally to moving one currency to bitcoin, and then moving bitcoin to a second currency. And in fact, there are huge volatility and complexity issues to manage.And cryptocurrency doesn’t help with that first mile and the last mile of a remittance: getting cash from a customer into a system that can send it abroad. “There’s no universal connectivity to all the institutions or remittance retailers to this ecosystem,” he says. The key problem is that “there is not enough demand, typically on one side” of a remittance to make a bitcoin-to-destination-currency transaction make sense.When that transaction is appropriate, it’s important to remember what problem has been solved: currency exchange. That, of course, is one of the problems that any remittance system has to solve, but it’s unclear why a horrifically volatile and scarcely adopted technology should be the thing to solve that problem. “Can I actually beat the exchange market by using cryptocurrencies to move from pesos to dollars?” Even if you could, “you still have to get the money from the somewhere and you have to get it out to the customer.” That means retail branches across the world, mature compliance systems, and lots of people already using the network.Remittances are about currency exchange and currency delivery. It’s not clear why blockchain is necessarily better for either.Funding Circle is planning to go public. “Talk of how algorithms make for better risk managers than experienced humans or institutions is still meaningless given how benign the current cycle has been,” Bloomberg notes. And it’s not just Funding Circle that’s looking to IPO. Quartz points out that seven fintech firms “have announced or completed initial public offerings (IPOs) this year, on pace to set an annual record.”One year ago,            Equifax      got hacked. Two U.S. agencies aren’t saying what the company has done in response to the loss of 140 million Americans’ personal data, the New York Post reports.The story about            Goldman Sachs      abandoning plans to trade bitcoin is “fake news,” CFO Marty Chavez said. Earlier, a spokesman for the firm provided Barron’s with a more measured non-denial denial.

1,"Even the most devoted Bitcoin convert will admit the network is slow.We noted in a December cover story that            Visa      (ticker: V) “can process 10,000 times as many transactions per second as Bitcoin’s vaunted blockchain.” Evercore ISI analyst David Togut offered slightly different numbers in a March 26 report. “Visa can process 65,000 transaction messages per second, at full capacity, compared with fewer than 10 bitcoin transactions per second.”In any case, you get the idea. Blockchain transaction = slow. So far that tardiness has created a moat of molasses that protects card issuers such as Visa,            Mastercard      (MA) and            American Express      (AXP) from Bitcoin encroachment. There are some ideas on how to equip cryptocurrencies with speed, however.Togut had some thoughts on two such suggestions at a March 22 panel hosted by Columbia Business School: “Blockchain: Recasting the Payment Industry’s Future.” Timothy Galebach, chief technology officer of Blockmason, suggested sharding. “Currently, every single node running the Ethereum network has to process every single transaction, which is why it’s slow,” Togut wrote. “With sharding, the network is partitioned into shards where only certain nodes process transactions for certain shards, allowing for greater speed. However, fewer nodes means reduced security, and risk of centralization; problems which have yet to be addressed.”We don’t think users would settle for less security. The other alternative was proposed by Jeff Bandman, a principal at Bandman Advisors and a former regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “Business practices could be put in place to allow for the slower verification process of blockchain, or a hybrid payments solution could be created utilizing both card and blockchain payments,” Togut noted.Perish the thoughts. Throughout advances in technology, users have never accommodated “slower” in their vocabulary. We refer readers to Emily Dickinson, who noted that only Death itself will wait patiently. A hybrid solution looks nice in theory, but it would still be slower than the card system alone.In a March 6 report, Togut wrote, “We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies pose limited disintermediation risk to our payments coverage, including Mastercard, Visa and American Express.” We agree completely.On the other hand, the Evercore analyst wrote in the earlier report that “blockchain offers long-term cost-reduction and efficiency-creation opportunities for our Bank Technology coverage, especially            Fidelity National Information Services      (FIS),            Fiserv      (FISV) and            Jack Henry & Associates      (JKHY), and the market share leader in U.S. proxy services,            Broadridge Financial Solutions      (BR), in both transaction processing and trade settlement.”Togut also noted in the March 26 note that Bandman said “the underbanked” would benefit from cross-border blockchain transactions, as “too many intermediaries exist and transactions fees are high.” It’s telling that            Western Union      (WU) and            MoneyGram International      (MGI) have partnered with digital currency Ripple.Speaking of ripple, that’s all cryptocurrencies can manage to make in the card moats at this point.

1,"Shares of MoneyGram International (MGI) are down more than 9% this afternoon, after it and Alibabas (BABA) Ant Financial Services Group agreed to end their merger agreement, due to the fact that they couldnt get  the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) blessing.  Mizuho  Thomas McCrohan writes that its telling that the companies press release didnt name CIFUSs specific concerns, which leads him to believe that it was likely the U.S.s concerns about a Chinese company having access to U.S. consumer data. He writes that Alibabas Alipay segment can still achieve its aims even without owning MoneyGram outright (and indeed the press release includes a pledge from the two companies to work together on new strategic initiatives.McCrohan believes that if Alibaba can add Alipay as an option to U.S. Moneygram customers, the company will use pricing as a way to attract customers. That could affect Western Union (WU), which he estimates gets between 5% and 10% of its revenue from U.S.-to-southeast-Asia transactions, but he calls it manageable for Western Union. Additionally, McCrohan writes that Euronet Worldwide (EEFT) may emerge again as a bidder for MoneyGram.

0,"Late Friday, Total System Services (TSS) and Western Union (WU) both announced executive departures via 8-K filings. Total Systems President and COO Pamela Josephs resignation is effective immediately, while Western Unions Chief Technology Officer David Thompson will leave on December 1. Mizuhos Thomas McCrohan and Leonard DeProspo write that they view the developments as negative for both companies, reiterating a Neutral rating on Total System and an Underperform rating on Western Union.As for Total System, they write that the unexpected resignation of Joseph is a blow, given that she was viewed as a potential heir apparent to current CEO Troy Woods. The company didnt say why she left, but McCrohan believes that it shows that she lacked enough support on the board to become CEO, and her departure doesnt do much to quash speculation that Total System is in talks with Fidelity National Information (FIS), although the company denies this. Ultimately, they see greater downside risk for the stock after Josephs departure.As for Western Union, they write that Thompson, a veteran of   Symantec (SYMC), Oracle (ORCL), and PeopleSoft, is a material loss for the company, especially as the company is in the middle of its  expansive $100 million “WU Way” initiative, and this raises questions given the loss of a dynamic CTO that was helping spearhead this undertaking.Their recommendation in the payments space is Global Payments (GPN), which they have a Buy rating on.

1,"As technology has become more pervasive in our daily lives, the challenges in finding investment opportunities and understanding its complexity within portfolios have increased. With 2017 underway, many investors are looking at the technology landscape, seeking out the areas of opportunity—while also looking to sidestep potential pitfalls.Before investing in technology, it’s helpful to segment potential pockets that may be attractive versus others, because investments that can be considered “technology” vary across a wide spectrum. This makes it difficult to perfectly categorize the universe, but I’ve found focusing on nine technology-related industries within the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) is a good starting point. (The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by            MSCI,      Inc. and Standard & Poor’s.)In addition to the seven industries within the technology sector, I have added biotech (health care sector) and Internet retail (consumer discretionary sector). To analyze each industry, I used a proprietary methodology which ranks industries from most attractive to least attractive by equally weighting three different components. The components which this particular ranking system prefers are higher recent returns, a deeper valuation discount relative to its history, and stronger projected growth. The results are constructive for Internet retail, software and semiconductors while the methodology is wary of IT services, communications equipment, and technology hardware.Here’s a closer look at the rankings analysis I performed to identify the potential investment opportunities. RECENT RETURNS Evaluating returns over the trailing one year and six month periods, excluding the past month, reveal that software and semiconductors have performed the best of all the industries while Internet software and technology hardware have performed the worst. The ranking methodology, which favors strong recent returns, rewarded high performing industries as defined by their blended rank of trailing one year and six month returns while penalizing the poorer performing industries.Investors looking to apply a similar analysis on the stock level would discover that            Advanced Micro Devices      (ticker: AMD), 371% over the 12 months period and 101% return over the six month period, screens at the top of the list. The worst performing name has been            TripAdvisor      (TRIP), returning -24.4% and -23.9% over the same time periods, respectively. VALUATION Another important metric for investors to consider are trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratios. Predictably, when ranking industries from “expensive” to “cheap” the results were nearly the same whether P/E or P/CF was used. For both measures, technology hardware (P/E 16.6x P/CF 10.8x) was the least expensive industry and Internet retail was the most expensive (P/E 96.9x, P/CF 26.7x). For investors, it’s critical to take these valuation metrics to a deeper layer of analysis. For example, each industry is in different stages of its lifecycle, so it’s worthwhile to evaluate today’s value for a particular multiple to its history (in our case the quarterly average over the past three years). If we look at two industries and find one is trading at 10x and the other at 25x, we will be compelled to say the former is “cheap” while the latter is “expensive.” However, comparing them to their own history might show that the industry trading at 10x historically trades 8x, representing a 25% premium today, while the industry trading at 25x has typically traded at 40x, a -37.5% discount today. This methodology focused on the P/CF multiple because it tended to track P/E well while minimizing the number of observations lost due to negative values. The results showed only three industries currently trade a discount to their historic value with biotech, a -24.1% discount, and Internet software, a -4.0% discount, trading at the largest discounts. The industries trading at the highest premium are technology hardware (+27.6%) and software (+15.0%). To overcome the fact that some of these industries can be dominated by a large holding, the proportion of firms within an industry trading at a discount (i.e., < 0%) was also calculated. Biotech again came in at the cheapest with 92% of companies trading a discount. The results for the least number of firms trading at a discount were also unchanged with technology hardware having only 17% of firms trading at a discount. A blended score was calculated based on the industry’s P/CF discount and the percentage of firms trading at a premium within the industry to get an overall rank. The methodology rewarded higher discounts and a lower percentage of firms trading at a premium. On the stock level, Twitter (TWTR) trades at the largest discount at -91.6% while            Zillow Group      (ZG) trades at 617.5% its historic P/CF, the highest premium of all stocks. By rewarding stocks trading at a discount and punishing those trading at premium, the methodology inherently anticipates multiples to mean revert. Implementing this analysis on individual stocks should be complemented with fundamental analysis to determine if there is justifiable rationale or an outlier event driving a large deviation from history. Twitter’s large discount is driven by the higher P/CF multiples it traded at early in its history while Zillow Group is coming off of a cash flow trough triggered by a litigation settlement.  GROWTH Looking at top line and bottom line growth for 2017 across each industry revealed that Internet retail has the highest projected overall growth, 38.3% earnings growth on 19.8% revenue growth, according to Bloomberg estimates. The second highest projected overall growth is semiconductors (38.5% earnings growth, 11.0% revenue growth) followed by software (16.7% earnings growth, 11.6% revenue growth). Communications equipment has the lowest projected values for each metric with 1.5% earnings growth on 1.4% revenue growth. Technology hardware is second lowest on each growth projection as earnings are expected to grow at 7.3% while revenue grows 5.8%. Investors seeking stocks using this growth metric should look into            LogMeIn      (LOGM) and            EchoStar      (SATS). LogMeIn’s earnings are projected to grow 271% growth on revenue growth of 198% while EchoStar has a projected earnings decline of 71% on a sales decline of 33%. SO WHERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY? The preferred industries—based on this proprietary methodology which evaluated recent returns, valuations and growth—are Internet retail, software and semiconductors. While no industry consistently screens at the top across all metrics, they are typically at the top for two of three metrics. One commonality these three industries share is their exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) theme playing out within the technology sector today. The AI trend has been underway for years but more recently its commercial success is leading to real profits. Investors seeking individual stocks within these industries should focus on stocks with the greatest advantages within AI. For Internet retail and software, it is those with the technical ability to implement AI in conjunction with the proprietary data to extract insight and provide “AI-as-a-service”. Within semiconductors, it is companies best positioned to help bring AI capabilities to the corporate sector more broadly. Additionally, I have ranked each individual firm for those investors interested in how this methodology evaluates stocks. Three names that come to the top of the screen are            Incyte      (INCY),            Proofpoint      (PFPT) and            Applied Materials      (AMAT). Incyte screens quite well on each individual category while the other two are rewarded being consistently in the top third among each category. Proofpoint and Applied Materials come from overweight industries.            Amdocs      (DOX),            Xerox      (XRX) and          DST Systems      (DST) screen at the bottom of my ranking system and all three come from underweight sectors. The top three stocks for each overweight industry not already mentioned include            Amazon.com      (AMZN),          Priceline      (PCLN) and            Expedia      (EXPE) from Internet retail,            Splunk      (SPLK) and VMware (VMW) from software and            Cypress Semiconductor      (CY) and            Analog Devices      (ADI) from semiconductors. The bottom three stocks from each underweight industry, excluding those already mentioned, are            Western Union      (WU) from IT services,          Brocade Communications      (BRCD),            Cisco Systems      (CSCO) and          Arris International      (ARRS) from communications equipment and the formerly related Hewlett Packard Enterprise (            HP      E) and            HP      (HPQ) from technology hardware.Identifying attractive industries and stocks is certainly a tall order as there is no perfect methodology one can use to make the right investments. An ideal approach should be based on principals the investor believes to be true and applied in a consistent, systematic manner that minimizes an individual’s ad hoc influence.

1," Evercore ISI Euronet Worldwide announced its proposal to acquire            MoneyGram International      for $15.20 per share or $1.8 billion, including $764 million of net debt, and representing seven times latest-12-months adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.The $15.20 per-share purchase price is a 15% premium over           Alibaba Group Holding      (ticker: BABA) unit Ant Financial Services Group’s bid and a 20% premium over MoneyGram’s (MGI) closing price Monday. If the deal closes, in year one, the acquisition should be 3%-5% accretive to Euronet’s (EEFT) adjusted EPS and in year two could be 13%-15% accretive.Combined with MoneyGram, Euronet would become one of the largest global money-transfer players, allowing it to better compete against money-transfer giant, In Line-rated            Western Union      (WU) with 500,000 agent locations, in our view. On average, Western Union’s pricing remains at a 20% premium to competitors. We believe the Euronet-MoneyGram acquisition will pressure Western Union’s cross-border pricing. While some agent locations may be redundant, currently, Euronet has 317,000 agent locations and MoneyGram 357,000.In year one, the acquisition should be 3%-5% accretive to adjusted EPS and in year two could be 13%-15% accretive upon realization of $60 million in cost synergies driven by maintaining combined selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs levels while growing revenue and generating savings through the utilization of both transaction networks. Such an estimate for accretion is conservative given it excludes any potential revenue synergies, in our view. Additionally by eliminating redundancies, Euronet will reduce capital expenditures aiding strong generation of free cash flow.In this all-cash deal, Euronet will finance with debt, bringing pro-forma leverage, including planned cost synergies to 3.8 times at closing. Within 24 months, Euronet plans to reduce leverage to below three times.The transaction could close by year-end 2017, subject to shareholder and customary regulatory approval. MoneyGram will need to terminate its agreement with Ant Financial and subsequently enter into a merger agreement with Euronet. Euronet remains confident that the deal will not face antitrust issues given a highly fragmented money-transfer market, and is including a $69 million termination fee in the contract, four times higher than Ant Financial’s $17.5 million termination fee. For Ant Financial to acquire MoneyGram, such deal would need to go through a substantial review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Euronet anticipates MoneyGram’s board of directors will make a decision on the Euronet proposal this week.MoneyGram’s broad presence in large retailers and post offices will expand Euronet’s Money Transfer footprint, which currently consists of smaller, independent agents. Such deal will also enhance Euronet’s digital capabilities, allowing it to better compete against new digital entrants. Euronet plans on maintaining both the MoneyGram and Ria brands.In conjunction with the acquisition announcement, Euronet announced it has renewed its contract with            Wal-Mart Stores      (WMT) to power its domestic Walmart2Walmart product. -- Rayna Kumar  -- Anthony Cyganovich  -- David Togut To be considered for the Soapbox feature, please submit an original article of less than 1,000 words to research@barrons.com with “Soapbox Submission” in the headline.

1,"HP Inc.      shares have been dragged down in the market sell-off, despite the company’s pledge to buy back half of its outstanding shares and the hostile tender offer from Xerox. JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster thinks the sell-off has gone too far. On Thursday, he upped his rating on HP (ticker: HPQ) to Overweight from Neutral, with a price target of $24. Coster writes in a research note that the call is “taking advantage of the market correction to buy an attractively valued stock in advance of positive catalysts.” He notes that HP has pledged to buy back $8 billion of stock within 12 months of its upcoming annual meeting—and the company intends to buy back $15 billion of stock over the next three years. Meanwhile,            Xerox      (XRX) still has a $24-a-share cash and stock takeover bid on the table (although the actual value of that offer has dropped to $22.32, as Xerox shares have tumbled in the selloff.) An HP bid for Xerox is also a potential outcome, he adds. At some point, he notes, the coronavirus disruption to the company’s supply chain will ease. On the virus issue, he notes that HP was one of the first companies to pre-announce a negative impact from COVID-19, and “could be first out with good news on the supply-side (barring a relapse).” He says the company seems confident about supply, but with some concerns about demand as business and consumer spending slow, partially offset with additional PC and printer sales as more people work from home.Coster thinks the market selloff makes it more difficult for Xerox to successfully close its bid for HP, given the debt financing required for the deal and reduced investor appetite for credit risk.“Our guess at probable outcomes here? HP probably goes it alone, but there is still a small chance that HP makes a counter bid for Xerox, and we think an even thinner chance that Xerox wins the shareholder vote and proceeds to acquire HP,” he writes.Coster notes that as of Wednesday’s close, the stock was trading at 7.4 times calendar 2020 estimated non-GAAP EPS, and 5.4 times estimated calendar 2020 EBITDA, discounts to the three-year historic averages of 10.2 times for EPS and 7.3 times EBITDA. “We think the discounts are starting to look attractive, assuming there is a recovery in demand once Covid-19 is contained and the firm starts to buy back shares under the go-it-alone strategy,” he writes.HP shares on Thursday are down 8.1%, to $17.79, while Xerox is off 6.9%, to $25.91.

0,"HP Inc.      CEO Enrique Lores has had a remarkably eventful first few months as the company’s CEO. Since replacing Dion Weisler in the top job last August, the company has struggled through demand issues with its crucial print supply business, launched a new business model for printers, maneuvered through a microprocessor shortage, and dealt with the fallout from the rapid spread of coronavirus which has disrupted the companies supply chain. And, of course, Lores has been at the forefront as HP (ticker: HPQ) battles a hostile tender offer and proxy fight by            Xerox Holdings      (XRX), a company a fraction of HP’s size.A native of Madrid with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic University of Valencia and an M.B.A. from Esade Business School in Barcelona, Lores has been with HP since joining as an intern in 1989. Before his recent ascent to the top spot, he ran the company’s printing business, steering the company’s 2017 acquisition of            Samsung Electronics      ’ (005930.Korea) printing business. He also played a key role in the separation of the old Hewlett-Packard into two separate companies: HP Inc. and            Hewlett Packard Enterprise      (HPE).  Barron’s recently sat down for a chat with Lores in the company’s historic HP Laboratories building in Palo Alto, Calif., where the old offices of founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard are still preserved for posterity—and where the company’s engineers continue to develop new tech printing and PC technologies. Among other things, Lores discussed why HP is so opposed to the Xerox bid—and why HP might want to turn around and buy Xerox.   Barron’s: Enrique, let’s start with Xerox. You’ve repeatedly rejected their takeover bid as too low. But you’ve also said you see value in consolidating the printing business and that you’re willing to talk to Xerox about potential deals. Given they’re unlikely to raise their offer, that suggests you might want to buy Xerox. Can you explain your thinking?  Lores: When we look at the print market, especially in the office space, we don’t see significant growth going forward. But there are many competitors—and there is going to be consolidation. And when you drive consolidation by reducing costs, you create value. Three years ago, we bought the Samsung printing business. We drove consolidation and created value. It was a money-losing unit before we bought it and profitable the first year after the deal closed. That deal helped accelerate our growth in managed print services. With Xerox, the problem we have is with the deal on the table. It doesn’t create value for our shareholders.  Remind us why you said no. First, the price they’re offering doesn’t recognize the stand-alone value this company has. The second problem is the high leverage the combined company would have, which we consider extremely risky. Third is that the synergies they’re using to calculate the value of the deal are unrealistic. They count cost savings we’re already finding as a stand-alone company.  So what if HP turned around and bought Xerox? Hold on. There are three questions that need to be addressed first. How do we get to the right value exchange between the two companies? How do we create an entity with the right capital structure? And how do we align on a realistic set of assumptions for synergies? That’s the first conversation. How the companies get together, who buys whom—there are many ways of doing that, but we don’t think it should be the first conversation. You don’t actually compete with Xerox much, do you? The overlap is small. We’re a $60 billion company. About $40 billion of that is PCs, with zero overlap. Of the remaining $20 billion, about half is consumer printers, with zero overlap. Of the rest, we do about $2.8 billion in managed print services, which is where we compete. They’re about a $9 billion business. That’s why when they say there are $2 billion in synergies, out of a combined $12 billion in business—well, that would be a miracle. If you bought them, where would the value be? We see an opportunity to drive costs down. We are investing in R&D, we both invest in marketing. We estimate the cost synergies are around $1 billion. It would also give us a larger presence in managed print services.  But you repeatedly have said you have other options. Our priority is to execute our plan, which is going to create a lot of value for shareholders. We are open to exploring consolidation, but there are other opportunities we’re considering from an M&A perspective.  When you say other opportunities, are you talking about other printing deals? Or might you do something on the PC side? Both. There are opportunities in the print market. There are opportunities in the personal systems market. Some might involve consolidation, others might be about expanding into other segments. There are opportunities in graphics printing and industrial printing. There are opportunities in 3-D printing. Is Xerox open to the possibility of you buying them? We have talked, but I don’t see value in sharing the discussions we’ve had in public.  What are you hearing from your institutional holders about the Xerox offer and about your own plan, which includes a large stock buyback and cost-cutting measures? We presented our plan a few weeks ago, and since then we’ve spent a lot of time sharing, discussing, and explaining the plan. The response has been very positive. Investors understand how we plan to manage the company, and they like the amount of capital to be returned. Have you also been in contact with Carl Icahn, who is the largest Xerox holder and also holds a 4% stake in HP? We regularly talk to all of our key shareholders. He’s one. But we won’t talk about the specific conversations, not with him or with any others.  One of your biggest operating issues in recent quarters has been decreasing revenue from ink and toner. What are you doing to fix that issue? It’s an opportunity to become more profitable. If you look at our installed base, we lose money with 25% of our customers who buy a printer and either don’t print enough or don’t use HP supplies. We have a plan in place to address the issue. What’s the plan? The first thing is to shift from a transactional model to a subscription model. With the new model, we monitor the amount of ink in your printer and before you run out, we send you a new cartridge. You pay us a fixed fee per month. The model is very attractive for consumers—it addresses the two big problems consumers have. The first problem is running out of ink. The second is printing is too expensive. Your cost per page goes down by up to 70%.  Is that program fully rolled out? We already have 6 million subscribers, and the program is growing fast. In the U.S., 20% of customers who buy a printer end up as subscribers.  How are the third-party suppliers fighting back?  We’re seeing some retailers offering “replenishment models.” The difference with our program is that we get data directly from the printer, so we know exactly what you need. We know exactly when the printer is going to run out of ink. Also, the cartridges we use are bigger. The overall cost of our model is significantly lower. How does the hardware price vary if you pay for ink with a subscription? No change. The difference is that we’ll send you ink cartridges before you run out. You can drop from the program at any point, but the retention rate is in the high 90s. Customers love the program because it addresses a key problem—they don’t need to buy cartridges anymore, and the cost of printing is cheaper. Will most consumers adopt that model? We think 40% to 50% of customers will subscribe. The percentages will grow because that’s the way more and more consumers want to buy. But you are taking an alternative approach in emerging markets. Right. In those markets, the printer comes with a very big reservoir of ink or toner, which, depending your consumption rate, could last a year, two years, three years. That’s a change in our model, and those printers are profitable. The average life of a printer is three to five years. In many cases, you might choose to buy a new printer. But we also have the ability to refill the ink. You’ve also announced a shift in your business model for retail customers.  Yes, we’re adopting a model that looks like the one mobile phones used to have. We’re going to offer two options. One we call an end-to-end system, which will only work with HP supplies. The price of the hardware will be similar to where it is today. We’ll also offer a flexible system, which will work with supplies from other companies, and the hardware price will be higher.  And you are going to start doing that at the end of 2020. Yes. It will take almost two years to change the whole portfolio to this model. The important thing is the print business will be in much better shape as we drive these transitions. For the personal-systems business—the PC business—there have been some positive dynamics over the past year. The Windows 10 refresh cycle has driven demand, and memory chip pricing has been soft. And then there has been a tight supply of microprocessors. In the January quarter, you had your highest operating margins in the PC business in many years. But that’s not sustainable, is it? The PC business is more than 60% of revenue and close to 50% of profits. It’s a critical business for us. In recent years, we’ve been able to outgrow the market in revenue, units, and profits. We have been growing and improving profitability, driven by the innovation we bring to market, the experiences we create, and the scale we have. But what happens with margins? And growth? We’re confident in our ability to continue to grow the business at or above the market pace. When we look at the overall PC market, the expectation from analysts is that it will grow around 4% for the next three to five years in revenue. In the segments where we operate, which are not growing as fast, growth is 1% to 1.2%, and we should grow at or above that rate. In terms of margins, you’re right that the margins we have now are the best in a long time. Our long-term projection is for margins between 3.5% and 5.5%. So in the latest quarter, we were one full point above the top of the long-term range. We think at the end of the year we will be within the target range. Let’s discuss these component supply and demand issues. The component issues are extending the life of the Windows refresh, by not having enough processors, and now because of the implications of the coronavirus. We expect to see very solid growth in this business just driven by these changes. On top of that, there is a large installed base of PCs that are older than four or five years, hundreds of millions of units that will eventually be replaced.  You raised this notion about M&A in personal systems. What’s your thinking there? We’ve always said any transaction needs to be supported by three things. It needs to be aligned to the strategies we have explained. It needs to have a solid financial case. And we need to have an execution plan that will support the financial gains. If I apply those filters to personal systems, we have said that we see opportunities to grow in certain verticals where margins are better—for example, retail point-of-sale systems, where we are the leaders in the market. We have said we want to grow in the services category. We have said we want to grow in the accessories category. We have said we want to grow in specific premium categories. There could open opportunities to use M&A to complement our position.  Give us a brief update on how 3-D printing is going. It’s a fantastic opportunity. We are leveraging technologies that we have built for years. There are opportunities in automotive, in aeronautics, in the medical space. At the same time, though, we are talking about transforming large industries, and that takes time. But once it happens, it scales. And it is very sticky. That’s why we decided that this strategy for the company is to focus on real manufacturing opportunities. And we are actually making good progress in working with some of the largest manufacturing partners to use our technology to grow into this category.  I used to see the opportunity in printing replacement parts. But you see this as a primary production technology. The value of 3-D printing is not only in aftermarket parts. It is in designing parts that will be created with 3-D printing, because you can create structures that are more complicated, structures that with traditional modern methods cannot be built, but that have better physical performance. For example, something really important for cars going forward is weight, especially as we go to electric cars. With 3-D printing you can create much lighter parts. You can design a part of that because the same physical performance but significantly less weight.  How far is this from being material to your financial results?  It’s a great long-term opportunity, but it won’t be material for a few years.  Finally, how has HP been affected by the coronavirus so far? After the Chinese New Year, production didn’t restart at the pace it usually does. But it has been recovering. Clearly there has been an impact in terms of the products that we will have in the short term to sell. It’s a supply problem, not demand. Are you through the worst of it? In China, yes. But the situation is fluid. We have seen steady progress, with factories coming up to speed in alignment with a plan that we had two weeks ago. It has not gotten worse.  Is the impact spread across your business?  Yes. It’s an issue for print hardware, PCs, and printer suppliers. We were already having product shortages because of processors, and we have customers not getting the products they want. But that’s the situation we’ve already been in.  And what about demand? If anything, PC demand is stronger than we were expecting. As many companies launch their business-continuity programs, they need their employees to have PCs to work from home. In many cases, they had desktops, and now companies are offering them notebooks.  Enrique, thanks so much.  Write to Eric J.

1,"In            Xerox Holdings      has filed proxy materials urging            HP Inc.      shareholders to support its proposed slate for the HP board. Xerox (ticker: XRX) has launched a $24-a-share cash and stock bid for shares of HP (HPQ) , which HP’s current board has rejected as too low and not in the best interests of HP shareholders.Monday’s filing specifically focuses on the Xerox board slate, asserting that supporting its nominees “will send a clear and strong message to the HP board to negotiate with Xerox” on the proposed transition. Xerox adds that voting for its slate will show that shareholders want HP to focus on creating stockholder value, objectively evaluate the Xerox offer, and to negotiate in good faith with Xerox about the proposal.The filing includes a detailed “ticktock” of events in the relationship between the two companies, similar to, but with interesting differences from a similar timeline laid out in a recent HP filing. Among other things, Xerox asserts that former HP CEO Dion Weisler in conversations with Xerox CEO John Visentin “expressed particular interest in how a board of directors functioned when a company had a large activist involved or was owned or controlled by a private-equity fund.” That is an obvious allusion to investor Carl Icahn, who holds 10% of Xerox shares, as well as 4% of HP’s stock. According to the filing, “Visentin explained several advantages in each scenario, all of which were primarily derived from a greater focus on results over politics.” In other words, Visentin seem to be saying that having an activist like Icahn hanging around your stock is a good thing.The filing asserts that Weisler “often expressed frustration with certain members of the HP board, whom he said preferred listening to the sound of their own voice more than helping to facilitate effective and efficient strategic decision-making.” And the filing adds that “Weisler expressed particular concern about his senior leadership team...In one instance, after poor quarterly results caused a precipitous stock price drop, Mr. Weisler attempted to rally the senior leadership team and was outraged when he received questions from them about whether the poor results would impact bonuses.”Weisler has since stepped down as CEO over a family health issue.In the proxy, Xerox also proposes a measure that would repeal any amendments to the company’s bylaws approved by the board but not by shareholders since Feb. 7, 2019. That measure would appear to be targeted at reversing the company’s recent “poison pill” rights offering, which was adopted as a defense against a hostile takeover.HP shares on Monday were down 9.6%, to $19.36, while Xerox was off 8.5%, to $28.62.

0,"HP Inc.said on Thursday that its board had voted unanimously to recommend shareholders reject a $24-a-share cash-and-stock tender offer for the company from            Xerox Holdings.That decision is not exactly surprising—HP (ticker: HPQ) has repeatedly been saying “no” to Xerox (XRX) since the takeover drama began in November.HP shares were down 0.6%, to $21.47, on Thursday morning, while Xerox was off 4%, at $32.34.Repeating a position it has taken before, HP said the offer, which consists of $18.40 a share in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share, “meaningfully undervalues HP and disproportionately benefits Xerox shareholders.”HP adds that “Xerox is essentially offering HP shareholders something they already own,” and that the offer “fails to reflect the full value of HP’s assets and stand-alone strategic and financial value creation plan.” HP recently announced plans to repurchase about half of its shares outstanding, and committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to holders going forward via dividends and stock buybacks.Also, HP said that the Xerox offer “would create an irresponsible capital structure, resulting in significant risks for HP shareholders.” Xerox has lined up a lending group to provide financing for the cash portion of the offer.“Our message to HP shareholders is clear: the Xerox offer undervalues HP and disproportionately benefits Xerox shareholders at the expense of HP shareholders,” Chip Bergh, the chairman of the HP board, said in a statement. “The Xerox offer would leave our shareholders with an investment in a combined company that is burdened with an irresponsible level of debt and which would subsequently require unrealistic, unachievable synergies that would jeopardize the entire company.”In their response, HP rattles off a long list of reasons it opposes the deal, including the fact that Xerox management has no experience in personal systems, home printing and 3D printing. HP also contends that the estimates Xerox has offered on potential synergies “exceed reasonably achievable levels.”Xerox spokesperson said the company did not have any immediate comment.

The offer is for $18.40 in cash plus 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share.In a statement, HP said its board will review the offer, and advised shareholders “to take no action pending the board’s review and evaluation of the offer.”HP (ticker: HPQ) has continued to reject the Xerox (XRX) takeover bid as too low. In response, HP has adopted a poison pill shareholder rights plan and announced a program to repurchase about half of its shares outstanding. Xerox is also staging a proxy contest for control of the HP board.“Our proposal offers progress over entrenchment,” Xerox CEO John Visentin said in a statement. “HP shareholders will receive $27 billion in immediate, upfront cash while retaining significant, long-term upside through equity ownership in a combined company with greater free cash flow to invest in growth and return to shareholders.”Xerox said it has a commitment letter for $24 billion in financing from a group of banks that includes Citi, Mizuho, Bank of America, MUFG, PNC, Crédit Agricole, Truist and Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey. The offer expires April 21 unless extended.HP recently said it was reaching out to Xerox to see if there is common grounds for a combination of the two printer companies, a statement that spurred renewed speculation that HP might turn around and bid for Xerox, an approach that would require substantially less leverage than a Xerox acquisition of far larger HP.

0," Last November, when details were first trickling in on the unusual            Xerox Holdings      plan to bid for the much-larger            HP Inc.,      Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi speculated that the real goal of the offer might have been to goad HP to turn around and buy Xerox. That approach, he wrote in a research note at the time, made “a lot more financial sense” given that HP’s market cap is so much bigger—now $34 billion for HP versus $7.7 billion for Xerox.A lot has happened since Xerox (ticker: XRX) first offered $22 a share in cash and stock for its bigger rival in the printing business. HP (HPQ) said no. Xerox said it secured financing for the deal. HP said no. Xerox said a deal would generate huge financial synergies. HP said no. Xerox announced a board slate, raised its bid to $24 a share, and threatened a proxy fight. HP said no, no, and no. Over the past few days, HP issued a poison-pill rights offering, announced a plan to buy back 50% of its stock to boost shareholder value, and again told Xerox “no.”But amid a flurry of announcements yesterday, HP also said that it “is reaching out to Xerox to explore if there is a combination that creates value for HP shareholders that is additive to HP’s strategic and financial plan.” To read between the lines, that suggests HP might be interested in a deal in which it buys Xerox, as Sacconaghi wrote last year.On HP’s post-earnings conference call with investors Monday, Sacconaghi asked CEO Enrique Lores about that possibility. Lores dodged the question—but he didn’t say no. “At this point, Toni, I don’t think that who buys what is a real conversation,” he said on the call. “We need to make sure that the valuation of the two companies is fair based on the value that both companies are going to be bringing to the joint entity. We need to make sure that the resulting capital structure makes sense for the businesses where we will be operating and we need to make sure also that there is a fair, a clear assessment of what the synergies are. This is, I think, the important conversation for our shareholders. Once we clarify that, then who, how, are things that will be discussed after that.”That hint prompted Sacconaghi to ask in a research note today whether HP will now buy Xerox.“While HP implicitly stated it wouldn’t accept an offer from Xerox regardless of price,” he writes, “management did appear to express potential interest in buying Xerox instead, citing ~$1 billion in synergies, and indicated they were reaching out to Xerox to explore opportunities.” Sacconaghi calculates that buying Xerox for $11 billion—about a 30% premium—could add 40 to 80 cents (17%-35%) to HP’s earnings per share, depending on the mix of cash and stock, and that HP could still proceed with its huge buyback plan on top of buying Xerox without compromising its investment-grade debt rating.HP generates about $5 billion a year in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, he notes, and synergies from buying Xerox could add another $2 billion to 2.5 billion, with only a few hundred million dollars in incremental annual interest expense. A spokesman for Xerox yesterday said the company had no comment on HP’s announcements.It is telling that on a horrific day for the stock market—the        S&P 500      lost more than 3%—Xerox shares jumped 4.6%, to $36.46. HP shares rallied 5.7%, to $23.35, as investors reacted positively to HP’s stronger-than-expected earnings report and aggressive stock-buyback plan. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedHP Inc.      didn’t solve all of its issues with Monday’s fire hose of news announcements, but the printer and PC company has dramatically strengthened its hand in its battle to fend off a hostile bid from            Xerox Holdings.      It improved its standing with investors in the process.First, a quick rundown of the news:Even the bears on HP shares found things to like. Many analysts raised their target prices on the stock to reflect the updated financial outlook and aggressive repurchase plans. There seems to be growing agreement that the prospects for the current Xerox bid are fading fast, as HP cuts costs, buys back stock, and takes other steps to carve out an independent path that boosts shareholder value.The other interesting takeaway is that the Street seems to be more convinced that HP’s proposed talks with Xerox would turn the tables, and that HP could become the buyer. Some observers have noted that possibility since the start of this drama, given that an HP acquisition of Xerox would require much less leverage than a transaction with Xerox as the buyer. Meanwhile, almost ignored in the latest results is the fact that HP’s biggest ongoing issue—weakness in its ink and toner business—hasn’t been resolved. Revenues from printer supplies fell again, dropping 7% year over year. That issue, by the way, is in no way addressed by a combination with Xerox.Here’s a rundown of what analysts are saying.Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his rating on the stock to Buy from Hold, with a new target of $28, up from $19. He says the company’s announcements provide various scenarios that could allow the stock to keep rising.HP stock was up 7% to $23.64 on Tuesday.Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani maintained an Outperform rating and $26 target on the stock. HP “presented a credible and aggressive shareholder return policy that is an attractive alternative to the Xerox $24 a share offer, which would be done heavily on HP’s balance sheet,” he wrote in a research note. He says he continues to “see the path higher for the stock.”Barclays analyst Tim Long kept an Equal Weight rating, but raised his price target to $25 from $19. He said the stock-repurchase plan and a poison pill HP recently announced together “make it harder for Xerox to acquire HP.” He remained cautious on the stock given “elevated uncertainties as well as continued secular challenges in printing.”J.P. Morgan’s Paul Coster likewise kept a Neutral rating, but raised his target to $24 from $20. “HP remains open to merger discussions with Xerox, but we sense a high bar and an eagerness to quickly pivot to this go-it-alone strategy,” he wrote. ‘We raise estimates…but we think the stock is trading close to full value.”Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty stuck with her Equal Weight rating, bumping her price target to $24, from $21. “Investors have been concerned about slowing commercial PC growth and a messy transition away from the historical razor / blade printer model as HP shifts value toward printer hardware in some markets,” she wrote. But she added that the company has outlined how “earnings will grow even without top-line or mix-driven profit expansion.” She notes that “a combination with Xerox is by no means off the table,” and that management “left open the possibility of making an acquisition of Xerox’s size.”Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong kept his Hold rating, but raised his target price to $24, from $22. He contends that Xerox now looks more like a target than a buyer. Were HP to acquire Xerox, he noted, it could require HP to slow its plan to aggressively return capital to shareholders. “Questions remain, with no easy answers,” he wrote. “With potential downside to HP’s stock should the deal-talks fall apart in the near term, coupled with possible upside from present levels should a combination be negotiated, we continue to view HP’s risk-reward as balanced.”Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral, who has a Neutral rating and $22 target on the stock, still finds issues. He noted that the 6.7% operating margin in the computer business was the highest in his records, which date to 2003. But he sees increasing headwinds from a fading Windows 10 refresh cycle and an expected rise in memory-chip prices. While he thinks consolidation makes sense, he said HP’s poison-pill rights plan announced last week “effectively neutralizes Xerox’s proposed tender and likely extends the focus to the upcoming proxy fight, unless a negotiated transaction emerges.” Write to Eric J.

1,"In its latest move to counter a takeover bid from          Xerox Holdings,HP Inc.      said Monday that it would buy back up to $15 billion worth of stock, a figure equal to half its current market value. The announcement came on a busy afternoon for HP (ticker: HPQ), which once again rejected Xerox’s (XRX) latest takeover offer as too low, while reporting better-than-expected profit for its January quarter.HP’s shares rose 5.4% in late trading Monday. Despite the latest rejection, HP opened the door for talks with Xerox to consider a possible transaction, triggering new speculation that HP might turn the tables and make its own bid for Xerox.HP said it expects to return about $16 billion to shareholders from now through fiscal 2020, about half of the company’s current $32 billion market capitalization. As part of that program, the HP board has increased its current stock repurchase authorization to $15 billion, from $5 billion. HP says it will repurchase at least $8 billion of stock in the 12 months following its 2020 annual shareholders’ meeting. (A date for the meeting hasn’t been announced.) HP returned a combined $9.1 billion to shareholders over the last three years. Over the long term, HP said it would seek to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form buybacks and dividends.Without announcing specifics, HP said it would fund the share repurchase program through debt. As for Xerox’s bid, which recently increased to $24 per HP share, HP said the offer “undervalues HP, creates significant risk and compromises HP’s future.” At the same time, HP said it is reaching out to Xerox to “explore if there is a combination that creates value for HP shareholders that is additive to HP’s strategic and financial plan,” adding that the HP board “is committed to pursuing the most value-creating path and to serving HP shareholders’ best interests.” HP CEO Enrique Lores told Barron’s Monday that HP has held conversations with Xerox before and that “we are open to continuing those conversations.” Lores didn’t respond directly to a question about whether HP would be the acquirer in a potential deal. The news came late Monday as HP reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter profits and raised its full year profit guidance, noting that any impact on its business from coronavirus would be transitory. HP also set a fiscal 2022 profit target well above current Street expectations, likely reflecting the impact of the newly planned share buybacks.Revenue for the January quarter was $14.6 billion, down a fraction from a year ago and in line with Street estimates. Non-GAAP profits were 65 cents a share, well ahead of the guidance range of 53 cents to 56 cents, and above the Street at 54 cents. GAAP profits were 46 cents a share, ahead of the guidance range of 39 cents to 42 cents a share. The results were driven by the company’s personal systems business, which saw operating margins rise to 6.7% from 4.2%, as HP held prices firm amid a favorable component environment. Revenues were up 1% for notebooks, 2% for desktops, and 6% for workstations. Overall personal systems segment revenues were up 2%, while units were up 4%, with notebooks up 2% and desktops up 7%.Printing segment revenue was down 7%, pressured by a 13% drop in consumer hardware and another 7% drop in supplies, which has been sliding in recent quarters as more customers choose ink and toner from third-party sellers. Commercial hardware was down 1%. For the April quarter, the company sees non-GAAP profits of 49 cents to 53 cents a share, below the Street at 54 cents, reflecting the near-term impact of coronavirus. HP sources many products in China. HP CFO Steve Fieler said in an interview that without the impact of the virus the guidance would have been above the Street consensus.For the fiscal year ending in October, HP lifted its non-GAAP profit forecast range to $2.33 to $2.43 a share, up from a previous range of $2.24 to $2.32. Fieler said that the higher guidance reflects the company’s view that the impact from coronavirus will be temporary.The company also said it expects fiscal 2022 non-GAAP profits of $3.25 to $3.65 a share, which at the midpoint is more than $1 a share above the current Street consensus of $2.35 a share. The company didn’t provide a 2021 outlook. The company said it expects $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in non-GAAP operating profit in FY 2022, with $10.7 billion to $11.7 billion in cumulative free cash flow in FY 2020, 2021 and 2022. The company expects $1.2 billion in structural cost reductions in fiscal 2022, with $650 million of that flowing through to non-GAAP operating profit.HP said it has revised its long-term operating model for its personal systems business, increasing the target operating margin to 5.5%, from 3.5%. For printers, the company is setting a long-term operating margin range of 16% to 18%.A spokesperson for Xerox said the company had no immediate comment on the announcements from HP. Write to Eric J.

All Rights ReservedThree numbers to start your day:—when the data is released Tuesday. The predicted reading is a pretty strong one, it would be the highest since last August.Demand from American households—that is, not businesses—have become an important engine of economic growth. That is because demand from China and Europe is harder to rely on these days. We can thank last year’s tariffs and this year’s coronavirus scare for that. But investors have been worried that the recent slowdown from the coronavirus could be, well, contagious. In fact, on Friday, one important measure of U.S. economic activity showed a contraction for the first time since 2013. —today after the closing bell. The technology company, known for its PCs and printers, is expected to report slightly higher earnings per share, and nearly flat sales for its fourth quarter. But that is not where the fireworks will be. Those will come when HP updates investors on its takeover fight with its competitor Xerox Holdings (XRX).Here’s the back story: Late last year, Xerox made a $22-per-share bid for HP, but that offer was rejected. Repeatedly. Earlier this month,            Xerox      raised its price by $2, to $24 a share. HP (HP) hasn’t formally responded to that offer yet. But last week it did unveil a so-called poison pill, a maneuver intended to make hostile takeovers prohibitively expensive. So investors aren’t optimistic that this will be an offer HP accepts.—for the fourth quarter. Those earnings are scheduled to come out tomorrow before the open of trading. Home Depot’s financial results matter because they can help analysts gauge the health of the American household, and the housing market, too. Home sales and renovations are good for the retailer -- and they also create a lot of economic activity. Now, the company’s sales didn’t rise very quickly last year, and executives don’t expect red-hot growth this year either. But with low rates for mortgages, a strong jobs market, and even a small fourth-quarter increase in lumber prices, analysts say investors shouldn’t worry about Home Depot (HD).

1,"Something is brewing at            HP Inc.,      and there are hints that            Xerox Holdings       might not like what the company has in mind.On Tuesday, HP (ticker: HPQ) said it will announce earnings on Feb. 24 for its fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31. More interestingly, it said it would also “share additional information about its plan to drive sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, including through the execution of the company’s multi-year strategic and financial plan and the deployment of its strong balance sheet.”HP added that it “wants its shareholders to have full information on the company’s earnings and the value inherent in the company before responding” to the recently increased $24-a-share takeover bid for the company from Xerox (XRX).Xerox began its pursuit of HP in November with a bid of $22 a share. HP repeatedly rejected the offer as too low. Xerox has now increased its bid, proposed a slate of directors to take control of HP’s board of directors, and is threatening to initiate a tender offer for HP shares in early March.To date, HP hasn’t responded to the higher bid, which consists of $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share. Xerox continues to say that it sees at least $2 billion in cost synergies from combining the two companies. It has also said that it has borrowing commitments to fund the cash portion of its bid.HP repeatedly has said it has other paths to boost shareholder value, including potentially leveraging up its balance sheet and conducting a large stock buyback program.In a research note Wednesday, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote that based on the language in the news release, he thinks HP will likely pursue a stand-alone path, perhaps initiating a large share repurchase, and could announce incremental cost-cutting measures. He said a higher share price or a more levered balance sheet, or both, could make the company a less-attractive takeout candidate.HP shares rose 1.1%, to $22.48 on Wednesday. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      gained 0.9%. Write to Eric J.

0,"Xerox       has raised its offer to acquire            HP Inc.      to $24 a share, from $22. The new bid consists of $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share. Xerox also said it intends to make a tender offer for all of HP’s shares “on or around” March 2. The new proposal values HP at $34.8 billion. Xerox (ticker: XRX) has been pursuing a deal with HP (HPQ) since November, and HP has repeatedly rejected the overtures. Xerox has asserted that combining the two printing companies could yield $2 billion in cost synergies. Some investors have suggested that the considerable debt Xerox would require to complete the cash portion of the deal argues for reversing the transaction, with HP buying Xerox. But there is no indication that HP is interested in that approach. Xerox recently proposed a full slate of directors to replace the current HP board. Note that HP’s market cap at $32.4 billion is about quadruple the current $8 billion value of Xerox shares. Xerox said in a statement Monday morning that it had met “in some cases multiple times” with many of HP’s largest stockholders. “These stockholders consistently state that they want the enhanced returns, improved growth prospects and best-in-class human capital that will result from a combination of Xerox and HP. The tender offer announced today will enable these stockholders to accept Xerox’s compelling offer despite HP’s consistent refusal to pursue the opportunity.”Xerox asserts that the combination would provide synergies “incremental to any value that HP can create by revising its strategic plan or dramatically changing its capital allocation policy to incorporate additional share repurchases.” HP has floated the idea of a large stock repurchase plan as an alternative approach to boosting shareholder value. Xerox said the tender offer will be subject to a majority of holders accepting the offer.HP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.HP shares were up 2.8%, to $22.35 Monday morning. Xerox shares were up 1.6% to $37.78, while the        Dow Jones Industrial Average       was near the break-even line. Write to Eric J.

0,"Semiconductor shares were leading the market higher on a strong rebound day for the broader market Tuesday, as analysts and investors sort through the rubble of the downturn looking for likely winners coming out it. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised his rating Tuesday morning on            Nvidia       shares (ticker: NVDA) to Buy from Hold, setting a price target of $270. “We acknowledge it’s risky to upgrade a stock given this vicious pandemic and the subsequent economic fallout,” he writes in a research note. “However, during this uncertain time, we believe investors will flock to companies with superior balance sheets and robust free cash flow. Nvidia fits the bill.”Gill expects a pickup in demand for Nvidia graphics processors used for medical research applications in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. “GPUs can accelerate the analysis of whole genomes, which consist of 3 billion base pairs in human chromosomes, from days to less than one hour,” he writes. Gill also notes that with the stock down 35% from its peak as of Monday’s close, the stock trades at a multiyear P/E low.Goldman Sachs chip analyst Toshiya Hari chopped estimates across the board on Tuesday for both chip companies and semiconductor-equipment stocks—but he has a few stocks to recommend. Hari’s estimate cuts are driven by recent downward revisions in the outlook for key markets served by the chip industry. Goldman Sachs sees smartphone shipments this year down 1.4% from 2019, personal computer shipments off 10% and automotive sales down 3.5%. Hari writes that he has taken an approach of cutting estimates based on how various groups have fared in past recessions. “While we take no view on the development of Covid-19 and the impact it could have on end demand, and in turn, the semiconductor industry, we believe it is prudent to assume a peak-to-trough correction that is consistent with past downturns.”In reviewing the group, Hari shuffled some ratings, lifting his stance on            Xilinx       (XLNX) to Buy from Neutral and            Intel      (INTC) to Neutral from Sell. But he cut            Texas Instruments      (TXN) to Sell from Neutral, and            Cabot Microelectronics      (CCMP) to Neutral from Buy. He also removed            Applied Materials      (AMAT) from Goldman’s conviction list, while keeping his Buy rating on the equipment company.Xilinx makes field-programmable gate arrays, parts used in communications, data center, aerospace and other applications. While Hari says Xilinx isn’t immune to a downturn, he contends that the underperformance of Xilinx shares over the past 3, 6 and 12 months reduces the stock’s risk. He thinks fundamentals in the communications sector are “at or near trough,” and writes that data center remains “a secular growth business.” Hari contends that other key sectors for Xilinx—aerospace and defense—in addition to test and instruments are less economically sensitive than other chip end markets. The analyst also notes that Xilinx, as a chip maker that doesn’t operate its own factories, “has historically demonstrated relative gross margin stability during economic downturns” and that “relative valuation multiples are near-trough” levels. Hari concludes that any signs of improving earnings should drive an outsize gain in Xilinx shares. For Texas Instruments, Hari cut his price target to $88 from $123. He notes that the stock is often perceived as a haven, but that weakness in many of its key end markets as well as “above-peer operating leverage,” given it operates its own factories, “should pressure margins over the next few quarters and drive negative earnings-per-share revisions in excess of those for its peers.”As for Intel, Hari writes that there are “multiple near-term positive developments that could largely offset the headwinds,” including resilience in the server market and potentially in personal computers as more people work and study from home. But he says that because of increased competition, growing capital intensity and pressure on margins, he would avoid overweighting the stock.The downgrade of Cabot Micro, Hari says, reflects a special situation. The company’s core electronics materials business, which makes slurries used in chip-making, “is a high-growth, high margin business with a deep/wide competitive moat, and one that we continue to view positively long term.” But the company also makes drag reducing agents, or DRAs, used by oil pipelines. And he sees Cabot feeling the impact on that business as oil pipeline operators in the Permian Basin reduce their use of DRAs. Hari notes that Cabot is down 78% from its highs in February, but that “uncertainty surrounding the DRA business” will likely “weigh on multiples for the foreseeable future.”Near midday Tuesday, Nvidia was up 18%, Intel up 7.5% and Xilinx gained 6.2%. Texas Instruments rallied 5.4%, Cabot climbed 4% and Applied Materials jumped 12.6%. The        PHLX Semiconductor Stock Index      (SOX) rallied 10% and the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      had climbed 8.6%. Write to Eric J.

0,"The semiconductor sector could see earnings fall as much as 70% on average if the coronavirus pandemic triggers a global recession, according to Citi.“We believe it is time to assume a recession is coming given the extreme disruption happening to several businesses,” analyst Christopher Danely writes in a new research note. “As a result, we analyzed how far estimates fell in past downturns. We are not lowering estimates as we believe this is an exercise in futility given we’ll just have to change them again in a month and it is impossible to gauge how bad things can get.”Danely writes that his analysis of previous downturns from 2008-2019 indicates average consensus estimates can fall as much as 70% on average—with some declining 100%. In the 2008 downturn, the mean chip stock earnings estimate fell 70%—and the        PHLX Semiconductor Stock      Index, fell a stunning 88%, drastically outpacing the 39% decline in the        S&P 500.      The analyst says the companies in his coverage universe that have historical had the smallest cuts to estimates are            Xilinx      (ticker: XLNX) and            Qualcomm      (QCOM), noting that both also have been among the best-performing stocks in a downturn. He thinks Xilinx will see relatively small estimate cuts this time, but that Qualcomm could have issues “given all the demand destruction in cellphones.”Danely says the largest cuts to earnings estimates historically have been suffered by            Micron      Technology (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). He thinks AMD again is likely to suffer among the largest estimate cuts, but Micron “might buck the trend.”The companies that interest Danely the most right now are            Texas Instruments      (TXN),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) and Micron. “Texas Instruments has been among the best performers so far during the downturn and we would expect that to continue,” he writes. “Microchip has been among the worst performers but we believe it is unwarranted and would aggressively buy the stock. We also believe Micron might buck the trend given the oligopoly in DRAM and strength in the server end market.”He also notes that “checks indicate server demand has remained strong throughout the volatile order patterns, due...to trends of more people working from home and online demand for various products.” That’s good news for            Intel      (INTC), AMD, and Micron.Semiconductor stocks have recovered more than 6.5% on Tuesday, well ahead of the 4.7% rebound by the S&P 500.

0,"Is there something wrong with the vaunted 5G wireless rollout? That’s the question you have to ask after the ugly earnings report late Tuesday by the chip maker            Xilinx.The company’s December-quarter results proved disappointing, and its March-quarter forecast was worse. Xilinx            ﻿      (ticker: XLNX) disclosed weakness in both its wired and wireless components business, which it blamed in part on a slowdown in 5G network deployments, announcing a round of job cuts in response.For its fiscal third quarter, ended Dec. 31, Xilinx posted revenue of $723 million, falling short of the Wall Street analyst consensus at $730.6 million. The figure was down 13% from the September quarter and fell 10% year over year. Profits were 68 cents a share, above the 59 cents Wall Street expected. For the March quarter, the company projected revenue of $750 million to $780 million, sharply below the Wall Street consensus at $825.6 million.In response, Xilinx announced plans to cut its global workforce by 7% through “a targeted reduction in force and meaningfully slower hiring to replace attrition.” That implies the loss of about 300 positions.Xilinx said it expects to generate non-GAAP cost and operating-expense savings of $17 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter, while incurring a pretax charge of $25 million to $30 million for severance-pay expenses. “As expected, our fiscal third quarter was a challenging quarter and our revenue came in near the midpoint of our guidance,” CEO Victor Peng said in a statement. “Given the revenue headwinds we experienced during the quarter, we took actions to reduce our operating expenses which delivered earnings greater than our expectations.”Peng added that fiscal fourth-quarter revenue “is expected to grow on a sequential basis as a result of strength in our core vertical markets and a moderate resumption of growth in our data center business.” But he added that Xilinx is “seeing greater than expected weakness in our wired and wireless business due to a slowdown in both 5G and wired infrastructure deployments, in addition to ongoing global trade headwinds.”He added that the company expects some of those headwinds “to be persistent, resulting in revenue growth lower than our prior expectations.”On a conference call with analysts and investors late Tuesday, Peng added that the company is seeing “a slowdown in 5G rollout across multiple regions as many operators take a pause before the next wave of infrastructure deployment.” And he added that “wired revenues are being impacted by a broad based weakness in demand across multiple customers.”Raymond James analyst Chris Caso, who has a Market Perform rating on Xilinx shares, wrote in a research note that he had expected the company to miss Street estimates, but that the results were even worse than he had expected.“Xilinx threw cold water on the broader 5G infrastructure ramp,” he writes. “While we believe the company’s market commentary is directionally correct (for example wireless growth outside of China has not yet begun), we think Xilinx’s main challenge has been imprudently aggressive expectations...The good news is that the bar has now been reset, and lower expenses will provide a basis for earnings growth once business does begin to improve.” He said he doesn’t expect that kind of improvement for several quarters.Xilinx was down 8.1%, to $90.71 in premarket trading on Wednesday.

1,"Xilinx      (ticker: XLNX) shares are climbing Monday after Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong raised his rating on the chip maker to Buy from Neutral, keeping his price target of $115. Wong simply thinks Xilinx has become too cheap to ignore, even as he remains cautious on semiconductor names overall.“We believe that many risks remain for U.S. semiconductor companies including uncertainties related to U.S./China trade issues and U.S. action against specific Chinese companies such as Huawei,” Wong writes. “However, in our view, Xilinx’s stock price and estimates have, in recent months, adjusted to reflect these risks.”Xilinx, which produces programmable chips known as FPGAs, is growing even with Huawei-related constraints on its business. June quarter sales were up 24% year over year, despite the U.S. adoption of restrictions on sales to Huawei starting in mid-May. And he notes that the September quarter guidance implies 11% year-over-year growth even with a full quarter impact of the Huawei sales restriction. Wong asserts that the company has gained meaningful market share from rival Altera, which was acquired by            Intel      (INTC) in 2015. For the 12 months through June, he notes, sales at Intel’s programmable-solutions division—basically Altera—were down about 5%. The analyst thinks the market share gains for Xilinx in the quarter were in part a reflection of “strong positioning” in 5G, as well as improved performance in two other categories—aerospace, industrial and test, as well as automotive, broadcasting and consumer. Xilinx shares, which continue to trade well below their 52-week high at $141.60, today is up 0.5%, to $96.71. Write to Eric J.

1,"Semiconductor and semiconductor-equipment makers have seen their stocks rally in 2019 as some analysts and investors called a bottom in the highly cyclical market. But just because industry demand isn’t falling anymore doesn’t mean a recovery is afoot. The back story. Semiconductor stocks had a brutal second half of 2018, falling harder than the broader market. Investors looking ahead to this year saw lofty growth expectations meet the reality of a global economic growth slowdown and the U.S.-China trade war’s disruption to intertwined cross-Pacific supply chains.Christmas Eve 2018 marked the bottom for the stocks, which have rocketed back this year as investors have been willing to give chip companies another chance. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker: SOXX)—which tracks an index of U.S. semiconductor companies—has returned 35% this year, including dividends, versus a 21% return for the        S&P 500.       What’s new. While a return to growth for overall chip demand may not be in the cards yet, KeyBanc Capital Markets semiconductor analyst Weston Twigg sees evidence that at least it isn’t deteriorating further. In other words, orders for a range of chip products may be done falling, as they have been for much of 2019.“Our quarterly Asia trip and supply chain findings revealed overall demand trends remain weak, but are not getting worse,” he wrote in a report on Tuesday. “Additionally, we were encouraged to find inventories beginning to normalize and expectations for normal seasonality in 4Q.”Inventories are not as backlogged as they have been in recent quarters, and while tariffs and other trade disruptions mean that uncertainty is still high, Twigg sees chip companies’ businesses returning to normal going forward. He particularly sees CPU, GPU, and memory companies as poised to see demand stabilize.  For semiconductor-equipment companies, the picture is a bit more mixed. Capital expenditures from memory makers are still weak, but Twigg called foundry investment “robust.” Looking ahead. Twigg recommends buying            Analog Devices      (ADI),            Microchip Technology      (MCHP), and            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI). He sees demand stabilizing and channel inventories becoming more favorable for these chip makers, and upgraded each of the stocks to Overweight on Tuesday.As the U.S.-China trade conflict carries on, Twigg expects Huawei Technologies and other Chinese customers to ramp up domestic production of components for smartphones and 5G infrastructure. That’s a negative for            Xilinx      (XLNX), which Twigg downgraded to Sector Weight on Tuesday.Twigg’s long-term outlook for the sector is more mixed.“With the escalation in the trade war and the accelerated initiatives by Huawei and other China OEMs to move toward China domestic and non-U.S. sources of supply, we are increasingly concerned about long-term implications for U.S. semiconductor companies,” he wrote. “Even post a potential trade war resolution, we do not anticipate a return to normalized U.S.-supply relationships.”The            iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      was trading down 0.7%, at $209.86, on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 was down 1%.

1,"Semiconductor-makers have faced a tough environment in 2019: high growth expectations have come up against the trade-war and economic-slowdown headwinds. But after these stocks plummeted late last year on those concerns, they have rebounded to outperform the market in year to date. Where the sector goes next is a subject of disagreement on Wall Street. The back story. Semiconductor and semiconductor-equipment makers belong to an inherently cyclical industry that sees periodic episodes of booming growth followed by inventory corrections—the current situation. After strong industrywide sales growth of 8% in 2018 excluding memory, the sector is on track for a 6% drop this year. The U.S.-China trade war has extended the current downturn. Most major semi players have been caught in the middle of the conflict, with supply chains and customers on both sides of the Pacific.The            iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF      (ticker: SOXX)—which tracks an index of U.S. semiconductor companies—tumbled a steep 18% in the second half of 2018 through Christmas Eve, after dividends, versus a 12% loss for the broader        S&P 500.But so far this year, investors have been willing to give semiconductor stocks another chance. Wall Street estimates for chip company earnings came down, managements reset their forward guidance, and the stocks have still bounced back. The semiconductor index has returned over 32% this year versus 17.5% for the S&P 500. What’s new. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur sees that outperformance continuing through the second half of 2019 as both supply and demand sides of the equation improve for semiconductor companies.“We remain confident in a second-half pickup in overall demand with near seasonal demand in PC computing, wireless/wired infrastructure (around 5G), aerospace/defense, smartphones (ex-Huawei), consumer/gaming, and a resumption in cloud/hyperscale spending trends,” Sur wrote in a report on Wednesday morning. The end of the year is a seasonally strong period for orders of chips used in PCs, smartphones, and gaming consoles, according to Sur. Ongoing 5G deployment in the U.S. and abroad will boost demand for wireless infrastructure products. He also expects data center capital expenditures to increase by as much as 30% over the first half of 2019, powered by big spending from the likes of             Alphabet      (GOOGL),            Facebook      (FB), and            Microsoft      (MSFT) on artificial intelligence and cloud chips.Others see a hazier near-term picture for semiconductor stocks. Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong noted in a report published Tuesday that total global semiconductor sales have declined at least 15% year over year in May, June, and July. Recently issued forward guidance from several chip companies implies continued sales declines in the fall, he added.“With the continuing U.S. restrictions on shipments to Huawei and rising tariffs on Chinese goods into the U.S., we think the chance of a meaningful recovery in chip end-market demand in 2019 is unlikely,” Wong wrote. “Our projections assume year-over-year declines in global chip sales in every month through the rest of this year.”For the full year 2019, Wong projects a 15% decline in semiconductor sales.Sur also acknowledges that the U.S.-China trade war, global economic data, and restrictions on doing business with Huawei could all be sources of volatility for semiconductor sector stocks. Looking ahead.            J.P. Morgan’s      Sur recommends buying diversified semiconductor companies exposed to growth in datacenter, automotive, and industrial products. He has Overweight ratings on            Broadcom      (AVGO),            Intel      (INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA),            Micron Technology      (MU),            Marvell Technology Group      (MRVL),            Texas Instruments      (TXN), Inphi (IPHI), and            KLA      (KLAC).Nomura’s Wong, meanwhile, is largely neutral on the sector, including Nvidia, Micron, Texas Instruments,            Xilinx      (XLNX),            Applied Materials      (AMAT), and            Analog Devices      (ADI).

0,"Selecting the right dividend stocks can be tricky.For one thing, it is hard to strike a proper balance between stocks with faster-growing dividends and those with higher yields.Bespoke Investment Group, an investment and market research firm, took a stab at it beginning 5 years ago. Its Bespoke Dividend Model Portfolio looks for stocks with above-average dividend payout ratios versus their sector peers and a history of consistently increasing those disbursements. The Bespoke model aims for stocks with payout ratios—the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends—of less than about 65% and tries to weed out high-yielding names with poor performance relative to the overall market. The weighted yield of stocks in the portfolio is 3.01%, compared with about 2% for the        S&P 500.      The portfolio, which is rebalanced once a year, most recently on Tuesday, has 20 holdings. The portfolio’s total return was 10.6% year to date as of Tuesday, trailing the S&P 500’s 18.6%, mainly because its cash position rose to nearly 40%. The reason for the big cash position was that the portfolio sells stocks when they fall to the specified stop price set by Bespoke. For example, stock A is acquired at $50 with a stop price of $40. If it falls to $40, the stock is sold from the portfolio.Now that the portfolio has been rebalanced, its cash position is back to zero.That wasn’t the only factor that has impeded performance, though. “Stocks with high dividend yields haven’t exactly been the best performers over the past year,” Beskpoke observed.Bespoke divided the Russell 1000 index into 10 parts, or deciles. As of Tuesday, the top 4 deciles measured by dividend yield had negative 1-year returns. At same time, the lower-ranked deciles all had positive 1-year performance.Stocks recently added to the portfolio include            AmerisourceBergen       (ABC), which yields 1.8%;            Texas Instruments       (TXN), 2.4%;            Target       (TGT), 2.6%;            Home Depot       (HD), 2.5%, and            Chubb       (CB), 1.9%.Four companies were removed from portfolio:            Verizon       (VZ),            Genuine Parts      (GPC),            Travelers       (TRV) and            Xilinx       (XLNX).Bespoke notes that its dividend portfolio “was never intended to act as a replacement for an asset allocation to fixed income.” With yields falling as much as they have, dividend stocks have been viewed as a bond proxy, especially sectors such as utilities and real estate.Since its inception on July 22, 2014, the dividend portfolio has returned 55.26% through Tuesday, compared with 64.31% for the S&P 500.

0,"Hedge funds soured on technology stocks in the second quarter, and increased their exposure to potentially politically sensitive health-care stocks.Within 45 days of the end of each quarter, hedge funds must report their portfolios’ holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a regulatory form known as a 13F. In a study published Tuesday evening, a team of            Goldman Sachs      analysts drew on those reports to assess the holdings of 835 hedge funds that managed $2.1 trillion as the third quarter began.While the        S&P 500      has returned over 18% since the start of the year, the average equity hedge fund has returned 9%—their best performance through August since 2009. A basket of hedge funds’ top 50 holdings did better, returning over 16%, but still lagged behind the market. Managers continued to double down on their best ideas. Goldman found that, on average, funds’ top 10 long positions accounted for 69% of their holdings, up from 57% 15 years ago.They’re also holding on to their positions longer. “In 2Q 2019, the average fund turned over 26% of distinct equity positions, a figure that typically registered between 35% and 40% per quarter during the last cycle,” wrote the Goldman analysts. Hedge funds reduced their relative positioning in information technology stocks in the second quarter and bought into health care. Compared with the Russell 3000 index of most U.S. stocks, hedge funds are most overweight health care, which represents 18% of their combined holdings, or almost 4.5 percentage points more than the index. Information technology is the most out-of-favor sector: At about 16% of hedge-fund holdings, it is almost 4.5 percentage points underweight to the index. Other overweights include energy, consumer discretionary, and communication services, while big underweights are financials and consumer staples.That’s been an unfortunate portfolio positioning this year, however. Tech stocks are the best performers in 2019, up 28%, while energy and health care have been the two worst-performing sectors year-to-date.The favorite new buys of hedge funds last quarter are headed by Invisalign makerAlign Technology      (ticker: ALGN) and enterprise IT giant            Cisco Systems      (CSCO). Other big new buys include            United Technologies      (UTX) and            Comcast      (CMCSA). The list of reduced positions is topped by            Corning      (GLW) and            Xilinx      (XLNX). Other top sells are            Chevron      (CVX) and             Alphabet      (GOOGL).On an individual company level, following the smart money has been a winning strategy over the past 15 years, according to Goldman. Since 2002, the stocks that saw the largest number of new hedge-fund investors in a quarter outperformed other stocks in their sector by an average of 0.59 percentage point in the following quarter. The Goldman team found the reverse holds true as well: Stocks with the largest decline in the number of hedge-fund owners in a quarter have underperformed their sector peers by 0.66 percentage point over the next quarter.Here are the top 10 new adds and most exited positions by hedge funds in the second quarter:Source: Goldman SachsSource: Goldman Sachs Write to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.comHedge funds soured on technology stocks in the second quarter, and increased their exposure to potentially politically sensitive health-care stocks.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

0,"Semiconductor stocks sensitive to U.S.-China trade are rising on Monday morning following the weekend’s G20-sidelines meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Japan. Companies involved in semiconductor design and manufacturing have been caught in the middle of the trade war, with many firms having supply chain and customer exposure in both of the world’s two largest economies.Although all current tariffs remain in place, the Trump-Xi meeting ended with an agreement to restart trade talks. The U.S. will also potentially lift some export restrictions on suppliers doing business with Chinese telecommunications hardware giant Huawei Technologies, which has been the target of a U.S. ban since May.The        iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF       (ticker: SOXX), which tracks an index of U.S. stocks in the semiconductor sector, rose 3.5% on Monday morning, versus a 0.9% rise for the S&P 500. “At the request of our High Tech companies, and President Xi, I agreed to allow Chinese company Huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our National Security,” Trump tweeted on Saturday night. The president’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow later told Fox News Sunday that Huawei will remain subject to “serious” exports controls.Bullish investors’ hope is presumably that what starts as narrow exemptions on non-sensitive technologies will lead to a greater accord that includes the removal of all new tariffs imposed since last summer.“It may be that Trump’s statement, to the extent it carries any real weight (we may just be getting jaded but we have seen this before) may just indicate more willingness to be a bit more liberal in granting export licenses for specific products where national security impact is deemed minimal,” wrote Bernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon in a report on Monday. “...it remains unclear if anything has really changed as there are already mechanisms by which (uncontrolled) products can be sold to Huawei.”Rasgon sees high-performance computing chips or products with artificial intelligence or 5G applications most unlikely to be exempted from the export ban. He cites            Intel      (INTC),            Nvidia      (NVDA), and            Analog Devices      (ADI) as potentially most exposed to products sensitive to national security concerns. The companies’ stocks rose 0.9%, 2.8%, and 1.8%, respectively, in Monday morning trading.Broadcom      (AVGO) counts Huawei as a larger customer for its networking and storage products, which Rasgon believes could have an easier path to exemptions. After declining over 20% in May as the Huawei situation deteriorated, the stock also has more ground to recover. Shares rose 5.2% on Monday.Other major semiconductor stocks rising on Monday morning include            Qualcomm      (QCOM), up 2.3%;            Texas Instruments      (TXN), up 2.6%;            Advanced Micro Devices (AMD),      up 3.9%;            NXP Semiconductors      (NXPI), up 3.6%; and            Xilinx      (XLNX), up 2.7%.Smaller firms that supply some components to Huawei also saw their stocks pop on Monday.            Microchip Technology      (MCHP) rose 5.2%,            Qorvo      (QRVO) rose 5.3%,            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) rose 6.1%,            Cree       (CREE) rose 4.8%,            Marvell Technology Group Ltd.      (MRVL) rose 2.2%, and            Lumentum Holdings      (LITE) rose 2.9%.Year to date, the SOXX is now up 30.5%, while the broader S&P 500 index has climbed 17.4%.

1," Twin Shots in the Arm. Stocks surged on Tuesday, with all three major market indexes up 1% or more. President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will meet at the G-20 next week, boosting hopes a trade deal can be nailed down eventually. Investors were also awaiting the Fed’s interest-rate decision on Wednesday for signs the central bank could cut rates this year. At the same time.            Facebook      (ticker: FB) unveiled plans for its new cryptocurrency, Libra. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Just Under a Record Stocks closed in solid black on Tuesday in anticipation of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy announcements tomorrow. The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      surged 353.01 points, or 1.35%, to close at 26,465.54. The        S&P 500      rose 28.08 points, or 0.97%, to end at 2917.75, and the        Nasdaq Composite      gained 108.86 points, or 1.39%, to close at 7953.88.The market rally today is partly supported by President Trump’s recent tweet on Tuesday morning that indicates he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 next week in Japan and that the respective teams will begin talks before the meeting.Still, officials from both countries have played down the possibility for any meaningful breakthroughs even if the talks were to happen. Investors are also sensing the unwillingness from both sides to compromise on the key issues in dispute. “We believe that the market is pricing in both a trade impasse with China as well as a Fed rate cut in response,” wrote Chris Zaccarelli of Independent Advisor Alliance on Tuesday. While market sentiment is leaning toward a rate cut as early as July, Allianz Investment Management strategist Charlie Ripley thinks Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely keep his options on the table without fully committing to any action in the near term. “In our view, escalating trade tensions won’t be enough for the Fed to send a strong signal for a rate cut in July and instead we will likely see some subtle changes in the statement and economic projections that tilt the committee’s views in a dovish direction,” wrote Ripley on Tuesday.If the FOMC officials do not signal any projected rate cuts later this year on the dot plot, it could trigger a deeply negative reaction from the market. The S&P 500 is now less than 1% below its all-time high, the benefits of a rate cut could quickly give way to doubt about future economic growth, according to Zaccarelli.“At this point, the market is primed for disappointment,” wrote Zaccarelli in a Tuesday note. “If the Fed doesn’t appear sufficiently dovish—including taking the word ‘patient’ out of their statement—or the G-20 meeting doesn’t result in significant progress in the trade war with China, then the market could experience a sharp pullback.”Investors are now the most bearish since the financial crisis in 2009, according to one measure by the latest Global Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch released Tuesday.Allocations to bonds jumped by 12 percentage points to the highest since September 2011, while equity allocations fell by 32 percentage points from May—the second-biggest monthly drop on record—to a net 21% underweight. Cash holdings increased the most since the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, while the U.S. Treasuries have now become the most crowded trade among fund managers. The Hot Stock Xilinx      stock (XLNX) rose 6.9% to close at $111.78 on news that Trump and Xi were meeting at the G-20.

0,"The founder and chief executive of Huawei Technologies Co. says the U.S. government is underestimating the Chinese tech giant, and within a few years no one will be able to catch up with its 5G technology.Speaking Tuesday to China’s state broadcaster China Central Television, Ren Zhengfei said a reported move by the Trump administration to temporarily ease export restrictions against Huawei was meaningless, as the company has already made preparations for such an eventuality, including stockpiling chips. He also said Huawei could make its own chips, though that doesn’t mean it intends to stop buying U.S. chips.Zhengfei said Huawei’s 5G technology would not be affected by a U.S. export ban, and that within two to three years, no company will be able to match its 5G technology.“The current practice of U.S. politicians underestimates our strength,” he said, according to a translation by TRT News.Ren said retaliation from the U.S. was inevitable. “We sacrificed the interests of individuals and families for the sake of an ideal, to stand at the top of the world,” he said, according to the South China Morning Post. “For this ideal, there will be conflict with the United States sooner or later.” Read our recent cover story: The Trade War Will Make Stocks Scary. 5 Reasons Not to Panic.On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials will announce later this week that some companies would be granted 90-day exemptions to the U.S. export ban against Huawei, a move that could give Huawei and U.S. companies more time to find backup solutions, as well as serve as a bargaining chip to potential new trade talks with China.Last week, the Trump administration announced a ban on U.S. technology and services to Huawei, among other foreign-owned companies, on national-security grounds. On Sunday,            Alphabet’s      (ticker: GOOGL) Google revoked Huawei’s Android license, and U.S. chip companies such as            Xilinx      (XLNX) and            Intel       (INTC) cut off chip shipments to Huawei, according to Bloomberg News.

1," One More Day Down. Stocks fell Monday, with all three major market indexes ending in the red, and the Nasdaq seeing the worst of it. With seemingly no end in sight to tariff tensions, more investors are feeling rattled about the prospect of a prolonged trade war. Tech was one of the hardest-hit sectors Monday, as Google and other companies reportedly took steps to cut ties with China’s Huawei Technologies after a U.S. blacklisting. Ford Motor      (ticker: F) announced plans to streamline by 7,000 white-collar jobs, or about 10%, to save an estimated $600 million a year. Shares of            Sprint      (S) and            T-Mobile US (TMUS)      jumped after the head of the Federal Communications Commission announced Monday that he will support a merger between the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers. In today’s After the Bell, we...   Tech Feels the Heat The        Dow Jones Industrial Average      fell 84.1 points, or 0.33%, to close at 25,679.90. The        S&P 500      tumbled 19.3 points, or 0.67%, to end at 2840.23, and the        Nasdaq Composite      dove 113.91 points, or 1.46%, to close at 7702.38.Investors continue to evaluate the consequences of the Huawei ban announced on Friday, which could jeopardize the success of the trade talks with China and impact many of the Chinese giant’s American partners.Already, chip makers including            Intel      (INTC),            Xilinx      (XLNX), and            Broadcom      (AVGO) have reportedly told employees that they will not supply products to Huawei until further notice. Mobile-phone-parts producer            Lumentum Holdings      (LITE) confirmed it would halt shipments to Huawei, and cut revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. Google’s parent company            Alphabet      (GOOGL) has also suspended business activity with Huawei that involves the transfer or hardware, software and other key technical services.The coming week will likely remain volatile for stocks, Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group wrote in a report. A slew of U.S data expected to release this week, as well as the minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting, should provide the market with some updated clues. But it is still too soon to see any impact of the escalation of the trade war on data, which explains why investors are reacting so strongly to headlines, wrote Lawler.“Whilst the latest headlines over Canada are supportive of sentiment, a news bite which increases risk aversion could be just around the corner. Investors know this and are on edge right now,” he wrote. “That won’t change overnight.”U.S. oil prices rose on Monday as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies inched closer to extending production cuts until the end of the year. The group agreed last December to cut output by a collective 1.2 million barrels a day. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, closed 0.5% higher at $63.10 a barrel on Monday, the highest closing price in nearly three weeks.“Oil has already rallied around 40% since the start of the year, thanks mainly to OPEC limiting supply,” wrote Lawler, “Investors had been growing nervous that OPEC could look to remove the production limits at its next meeting in June, in light of tightening global supply and elevated prices.” The OPEC production cuts have offered significant support to oil prices, wrote Lawler. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have also sparked fears of supply disruptions and played a role in oil’s rally. Recent attacks on tankers floating near Iran have led to high tension in the region.Oil’s moderate price increase today, however, was rather a humdrum response to the OPEC news, Barron’s noted. Investors are now worried about oil demand at the same time, given the reignited trade wars and slower global growth. The International Energy Agency reduced its estimate for 2019 oil demand in a report on Wednesday. Demand in Brazil, China, and Japan has lagged the IEA’s estimates this year.  The Hot Stock TechnipFMC      stock (FTI) climbed to the top of the S&P 500 on Monday, on news that its joint venture with Russia’s largest private gas producer will lead to a new liquefied-natural-gas plant.TechnipFMC stock gained 64 cents, or 2.9%, to $22.97.The energy-services firm said Arctic LNG 2, its joint venture with Novatek, will build an LNG plant, deepening their partnership.In the trailing 12-month period, TechnipFMC stock is down 32.8%. The Biggest Loser Keysight Technologies      stock (KEY) fell to the bottom of the index on Monday, following an analyst downgrade.Keysight stock dropped $7.30, or 8.9%, to $74.56. Robert W. Baird analyst Richard Eastman downgraded the electronics-testing equipment and software maker’s stock to Neutral from Outperform, and lowered his price target to $82 to $90, citing the ongoing tariff pressure on the tech sector. “Huawei is a small direct Keysight customer; however, the negative indirect impact (customers as vendors to Huawei) could weigh on Keysight’s growth rate,” Eastman wrote. “What’s bad for the U.S. tech Industry isn’t a positive for Keysight. China-related uncertainty may be an overhang on the shares in the near term.”Keysight stock is up 38.5% in the past 12 months. –Teresa Rivas Write to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com One More Day Down.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The stock is now up about 17% year-to-date.Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department said it was putting Huawei on its “Entity List” because of national-security issues, which mean companies may now be required to apply for a license to export technology to Huawei. What’s new. Nomura Instinet analyst David Wong on Sunday reiterated his Neutral rating for Xilinx shares, citing the risk of the U.S. government sanction against Huawei.“We think that action against a major maker of communications infrastructure equipment like Huawei likely poses risk for Xilinx,” he wrote. Wong noted Xilinx’s wireless and wireline segment represented 41% of its total sales in the March quarter. He estimates Huawei constituted 10% to 20% of the company’s sales in the quarter.“Outside of 5G, Xilinx has announced that Huawei uses some of its chips in datacenter applications,” he wrote.A Xilinx spokeswoman said Monday, “We are aware of the Denial Order issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce with respect to Huawei, and we are cooperating.”Xilinx stock was down 5.5% to $98.95 on Monday.

All Rights ReservedLumentum      cut sales and earnings guidance because the U.S. government banned the company, and other U.S. tech companies, from selling to Huawei. The Lumentum (ticker: LITE) news is the canary in the coal mine. Investors should prepare for a slew of guidance cuts from other tech equipment suppliers. The sales hiccup could be a temporary blip as Chinese-American trade negotiations grind forward or it could lead to some unintended consequences like the growth of foreign competitors willing to sell to the Chinese networking giant.  The back story. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced a plan to add Huawei and 70 of its affiliates to a list that bans U.S. tech companies from selling sensitive components and technology to Huawei. The list also bans Huawei from selling equipment in the U.S. Lumentum stock was already down considerably because of the Huawei ban. Shares have declined by 21% since May 15. Lumentum stock is down again in Monday morning trading, by 3.4%, worse than the 0.5% decline of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      Now Lumentum shares trade for less than nine times estimated fiscal year 2020 earnings estimates.  What’s new.  Lumentum had expected to generate about $415 million in sales and $79 million in operating income for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019 ending in June. Now the maker of 3D-sensing components expects to generate about $383 million in sales and $62 million in operating income, a cut of 8% and 21%, respectively. “Lumentum intends to fully comply with the recent U.S. Department of Commerce imposed license requirements for the export, reexport and/or in-country transfer of all items subject to U.S. export control regulations to Huawei Technologies,” the company’s press release reads. “Lumentum has discontinued all shipments to Huawei effective as of the date the licensing requirements went into effect.”Lumentum generates about 18% of its sales from Huawei. That’s high for a U.S.-based tech firm, but everyone in the tech supply chain is impacted by the ban to some degree.  Looking ahead. Nomura analyst David Wong writes that the action against Huawei may also be a risk to            Xilinx      (XLNX). “To our knowledge, Xilinx has never identified Huawei by name as a major customer that is driving its recent wireless strength,” writes Wong in a Monday research report. “Nevertheless, Xilinx has undoubtedly been benefiting recently from strength in demand for chips used in 5G wireless base stations.” Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland thinks the ban will hit Xilinx as well as            Synaptics      (SYNA),            Skyworks Solutions      (SWKS) and            Qorvo      (QRVO). “During our last trip to Asia we learned of buy-ahead purchases by Huawei of key U.S. components, particularly for 5G base stations, and to a lesser extent handsets,” wrote JP Morgan analyst Gokul Hariharan in a research report on Friday. “These purchases were described as an amount needed to satisfy one year’s supply and perhaps as much as two year’s supply.” Hariharan listed even more companies impacted by the ban including            Broadcom      (AVGO),            Intel      (INTC) as well as            Nvidia      (NVDA) and            Advanced Micro Devices      (AMD). The action against Huawei creates a lot of noise for investors to parse. Forward buying, temporary weakness and motivations for the ban will be topics of coming investors conferences and earnings reports. The situation makes it hard for investors to call a turn in smartphone demand and the acceleration of 5G spending by telecom equipment providers. The best case solution for U.S. tech suppliers is likely a rapid resolution to the China-U.S. trade dispute and a negotiated settlement about selling to Huawei. Hopefully, that will happen before U.S. companies lose sales in future to foreign competitors.

1,"There was good news, and plenty of reason for concern, in the latest report on manufacturing in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Manager Index—also known as the manufacturing PMI—registered above 50, the level that indicates growth, for the second straight month in February. That was Monday’s good news. The bad news is comments about coronavirus from U.S. manufacturers exploded from January into February. The common theme in the comments: “No one knows what’s going on.” Tim Fiore, who heads the ISM survey committee, told Barron’s that more than 40% of the comments from survey participants in February were about the virus, up from 2% in January. A big chunk of those comments expressed dismay over a lack of information. The ISM PMI report is a survey of 800 businesses. Manufacturers across 18 industries say whether things are getting better, worse, or staying the same in areas such as hiring, sales, orders, pricing, and inventories. “Think about if you are sourcing parts through a broker in China,” said Fiore. “When are you going to get them? You have no idea. You can’t call, you can get on a plane.” The import, pricing, new export orders and customer inventory components of the survey all fell from January to February. The import component of the survey fell from 51.3 to 42.6. Those declines highlight the impact of the virus. “We are in for a couple of bad months,” of PMI data, added Fiore. “The virus better be contained by April.” If it isn’t, he fears there will be pressure in other parts of the survey, such as employment. Some companies are starting to quantify the impact of the virus.            Zebra Technologies      (ticker: ZBRA) CEO Anders Gustafsson told Barron’s that shipping costs are higher and his Chinese suppliers are working at less than 100% of capacity. Emerson Electric      (EMR) told investors at its Feb. 13 analyst event in New York that the virus would shave about $88 million from fiscal second-quarter sales. Emerson management raised that estimate to $125 million on Friday. That works out to about 2.8% of expected second-quarter sales. Investors can look past a 3% hit to one quarter. The problem is that no one knows how bad it is going to get. Data from Johns Hopkins as of 6 a.m. Eastern standard time on Tuesday show 91,313 global cases with 3,118 deaths and 48,134 people who have recovered. U.S. cases reported by Hopkins total 105. Industrials have been hit a little harder than the rest of the market in the coronavirus selloff. The        Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF      (XLI) is down 11% over the past couple of weeks and down 7.5% for the year. The        Dow Jones Industrial Averageis down about 6% year to date. The        S&P 500      has fallen less than 5%.

1,"Industrial productivity-solutions provider            Zebra Technologies      celebrated a five-year anniversary with another strong earnings report. It has been quite a ride for investors since Zebra doubled the size of the company with the October 2014 purchase of Motorola Solutions Inc.’s enterprise business. The company earned $3.43 a share in the third quarter, better than Wall Street had predicted. Results exceeded even Zebra’s guidance given earlier in 2019. Shares (ticker: ZBRA) rose almost $15, or 6.7%, to $237.64 on Tuesday. Year-to-date gains amount to 49%, far better than the comparable 16% return of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      “The company executed very well with strong growth in the quarter on top of strong growth a year ago,” CEO Anders Gustafsson said in an interview. Health care and logistics were the company’s fastest-growing “verticals,” he noted. Logistics growth might surprise investors, because trucking volumes are weakening as the industrial economy slows. “We enable expedited delivery and e-commerce so it’s helped up us weather industry headwinds,” Gustafsson said. Strong results are nothing new for investors. In fact, over the past five years Zebra stock has returned 27% a year on average. Again, that is far better than the comparable 12.5% average annual return of the Dow. Five years is particularly relevant for Zebra, because five years ago—almost to the day—Zebra closed on its transformational $3.5 billion deal for Motorola Solutions’ hand-held computing and data-capture franchises. When the deal was announced, Zebra stock was worth about $3.5 billion and the company had no debt. (Today’s market value is almost $13 billion). The deal, engineered by Gustafsson, effectively doubled the size of the company, adding huge amounts of debt in the process. Zebra’s debt to estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda—a common measure of financial leverage—was more than 4 times in 2014. The average industrial company in the        S&P 500      typically operates with about 2 times financial leverage. Zebra has paid down debt—and increased earnings—and its financial-leverage ratio is back under 2 times. “Five years ago, traditional industrial logic was our Motorola driver,” Gustafsson said. He wasn’t making a big bet on an industry megatrend. Instead, he saw an attractive asset and believed Zebra could boost growth and margins if it were added to the company’s existing portfolio. He was right. “We delivered attractive 6% to 7% sales growth; good margin improvement; investors have been pleased.” Industry trends helped. As computing costs have fallen, retailers, health-care providers and logistics companies are providing employees with more hand-held computing devices—the kind Zebra sells—enabling higher efficiency and new business models. Traditional bricks and mortar retailers, for instance, are using cheap computing power to enhance inventory tracking so they can offer online sales from existing store footprints. That helps traditional retailers better compete with e-commerce companies such as            Amazon.com      (AZMN). The trend to higher levels of enterprise connectivity isn’t done yet. “We have some studies—look at different industries,” Gustafsson said. “The number of connected people is up a lot in retail and health care—a device for everyone is the new mantra.” That’s good news for Zebra shareholders. And over the next five years, Gustafsson sees Zebra morphing into a broader solutions player, being less dependent on hardware sales and selling more software-based applications. “The core business is healthy,” he said. “It will continue to drive shareholder returns and give Zebra the ability to invest in new solutions.” Nothing much seems to faze Gustafsson, but his view isn’t Panglossian. Trade conflict and its impact on China weighs on his mind. The quicker U.S.-China conflict is resolved the better for growth, he said. What keeps him up at night? “Delivering growth for the next five years.”  Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.comIndustrial productivity-solutions provider Zebra Technologies celebrated a five-year anniversary with another strong earnings report.An error has occurred, please try again later.Thank youThis article has been sent toCopyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

1,"Midwestern brokerage firm R.W. Baird listed its top industrial-stock ideas for the balance of 2019, in an expansive research report Monday. The picks are sorted for growth and value investors. Baird analysts still see opportunity in the industrial sector despite global headwinds, including the U.S.-China trade war, that have weighed on industrial-investor sentiment since the end of 2017. Industrial production peaked at the end of 2017, a little before the global trade war heated up. U.S. and Chinese car sales, important drivers of industrial activity, dipped and global construction spending growth decelerated. “There are very few bright spots within industrial markets globally,” Citigroup analyst Timothy Thein wrote in another Monday research report. Still, there are pockets of strength, such as in aerospace & defense, as well as some idiosyncratic stock situations Baird thinks are worth a look now. For value investors, Baird likes commercial aerospace giant            Boeing      (ticker: BA), engineering firm            Aecom      (ticker: ACM), trucker            Knight-Swift Transportation      (KNX) and restaurant equipment maker            Welbilt      (WBT). For growth investors, industrial stocks the broker is highlighting include industrial-services company            Clean Harbors      (CLH), generator maker            Generac      (GNRC), defense contractor            L3Harris Technologies      (LHX) and mobile-computing company            Zebra Technologies      (ZBRA) On the value side of the equation, the four Baird picks trade for an average of about 13.7 times estimated 2020 earnings, a discount to the 15 times valuation multiple for stocks in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      The reason Boeing qualifies as a value pick should be obvious. The stock has been battered since the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX jet, the second fatal accident involving the new MAX plane. Boeing stock is down about 20% since early March, while other aerospace & defense companies have risen about 10% from the same point. “Lots of headline risk priced in and 2020 deliveries will be aided by stored aircraft,” analyst Peter Arment wrote. He still thinks it is likely the 737 MAX will return to service in late 2019, which is key to seeing Boeing shares move higher. Wall Street seems to agree with Arment, as more analysts rate the stock a Buy than a Sell, despite Boeing’s difficult year. “Aecom is the largest global provider of engineering, architectural, design and program/construction management services to government and commercial clients,” analyst Andy Wittmann wrote. “For years we’ve advocated Aecom simply to do what it’s doing today which is simplify the business, collect cash and improve margins.” He thinks recent results indicate the company is making headway against that list of goals. A little less than half of the other analysts on Wall Street agree, also rating shares a Buy. In addition, analyst Mig Dobre pointed out that Welbilt has a new CEO, with a 3-year plan to improve operations. Analyst Ben Hartford thinks trucking fundamentals could bottom in the first half of 2020. Freight volumes are down and truck stocks bottom before volumes improves, according to Hartford. On the growth side of things, the 4 Baird picks trade for an average of 19 times estimated 2020 earnings and earnings-per-share growth is expected to be about 13% on average this coming year. Analyst Mike Halloran calls Generac “undervalued at current levels” and thinks persistent power outages resulting from California wild fires represent one opportunity for more growth at the backup-power company. His view is unique, the rest of the Street rates shares Hold and the average analyst price target is $79 a share, up about 5% from recent levels. Halloran sees share hitting $86. L3Harris, on the other hand, is widely loved on Wall Street. All analysts rate the shares Buy, according to FactSet. The newly combined defense contractor will be harvesting deal synergies in coming months, according to Baird. Analyst Rick Eastman thinks Zebra will continue to benefit from omnichannel retail trends—with traditional retailers adopting smart technologies to better compete with online sellers such as            Amazon.com      (AMZN). And Dave Manthey thinks Clean Harbors has upside from new marine regulations regrading lower sulfur emission that go into effect in January 2020. Clean Harbors is an environmental and industrial service provider and operator of waste treatment facilities. Overall, industrial stocks have had a tough time for a while. The        Vanguard Industrial ETF      (VIS) has lost about 3.7% over the past year, worse than the 1% gain of the        S&P 500      over the same span. Trade detente could be a catalyst for all industrial stocks, as could more rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. But even if the macroeconomic conditions don’t improve, there are still some stocks that can produce results for investors.

0,"Zebra Technologies,      an official partner of the NFL, has made a touchdown and scored the extra point.Zebra stock (ticker: ZBRA) soared Tuesday after the maker of mobile-computing equipment reported second-quarter earnings. Sales and earning both beat Wall Street expectations, sending the stock up $29.03, or 15.3%, to $218.45.Despite the rally, over the last month Zebra stock is up only 3.6%, a little better than the 2.1% change of the        Dow Jones Industrial Average      over the same span. That means that results were a relief for investors worried about slowing industrial trends. Don’t forget, Zebra stock dropped 7.7% after            Honeywell International      (HON) reported slower-than-expected automation revenue on July 18. Only that part of Honeywell competes with Zebra; the rest of Honeywell’s business performed well and its stock rose that day. What’s more, the results demonstrate that positive business trends affecting Zebra are overwhelming the negative economic concerns swirling about the market. “I would say our products are now foundational,” says CEO Anders Gustafsson to Barron’s. In the past, business might avoid purchasing Zebra mobile computing products if the economy weakened. “Our value proposition works in good times and bad times.” Retail, for instance, can’t afford to stop investing in so-called omnichannel technology—needed to fulfill online orders to and from multiple locations—because the pressure to compete with e-commerce giants such as            Amazon.com      (AMZN) is too great. Zebra is also expanding the markets it serves. One of the most interesting growth markets is now the NFL. The company makes the technology that tracks player movement and vital statistics that are ubiquitous in sports coverage. “We have the RFID stuff,” New York Jets coach Adam Gase told 98.7 ESPN Radio Monday evening, “Everyday quarterback Sam Darnold is like, ‘I’m gonna have the most yards.’” Gase is referring to data analysis enabled by Zebra technology. It’s Zebra products that keep track of Darnold’s yards.“We’re not going to break out revenue for the NFL,” Gustafsson tells Barron’s with a chuckle. “But it illustrates what we are doing—leveraging data at the edge.” And Zebra is benefitting immensely from its ability to take and analyze such “edge” data generated by machines on factory floors, or by workers in warehouses, or by players on the field. Investors have taken notice. Zebra stock has soared almost 60% a year on average for the past three years, far better than the 16.5% average annual return of the Dow. Still, Gustafsson is upbeat. “I feel better about the business than I did a few years ago.” Zebra stock trades for about 16.5 times estimated 2020 earnings, about an 8% premium to stocks in the Dow.

0,"Honeywell      reported another solid quarter Thursday morning, increasing its forecast for 2019 earnings for the second time this year. The industrial conglomerate (ticker: HON) reported second-quarter earnings of $2.10 a share and $9.2 billion in sales. Earnings per share beat Wall Street predictions by about 2 cents. Full-year earnings guidance was also raised by about 2 cents per share. Management now expects to earn roughly $8.05 a share in 2019, although Wall Street believes the company can earn $8.11, meaning analysts are still a little more optimistic than management.Growth in its aerospace business, up 11% year over year on a comparable basis, was a big driver of the second-quarter numbers. That’s good news for other aerospace companies, although investors are getting used to strong trends in the industry.  The back story. Honeywell is transforming itself into a so-called software industrial company under the leadership of CEO Darius Adamczyk. In recent years, the company has shed automotive and chemical businesses and added smart-metering and warehouse-automation franchises. Shareholders appear to approve of the overhaul. Honeywell stock has returned 28% year to date, better than 18% for the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      “We are making significant progress in transforming Honeywell into a premier software-industrial company, with connected software sales continuing to grow at a double-digit rate organically,” said Adamczyk in the company’s news release. “The Honeywell Connected Enterprise foundation is firmly in place, supported by the launch of Honeywell Forge, a comprehensive Industrial Internet of Things software solution.” What’s new. Honeywell’s aerospace, commercial building and energy business all increased their sales and expanded their margins year over year. Investors should cheer that performance. Sales in the other segment—Safety and Productivity Solutions, which includes much of Honeywell’s automation technology businesses—fell about 4% in the second quarter. Shares of other automation-technology providers, such as            Zebra Technologies      (ZBRA), could react to the decline.  Looking ahead. Even though sales in one segment declined, Barron’s thinks the overall earnings report looks solid. The only real complaint investors may have with Honeywell is about its valuation. Shares trade for about 20 times estimated earnings for next year, a premium to other industrial companies in the        S&P 500.      On a conference call with investors, Honeywell remained upbeat about the outlook for aerospace, but didn’t offer any news about            Boeing’s      (BA) grounded 737 MAX jet. “Regarding the Boeing 737 MAX situation, we remain aligned to Boeing’s stated production schedule, and we’ll continue to monitor the situation closely,” CFO Gregory Lewis said. “But as we stated previously, we do not anticipate a significant impact to Honeywell’s operational results in 2019.”Some 3% of Honeywell’s sales are to Boeing.Honeywell stock rose 1.8% in Thursday afternoon trading.

0,"Honeywell      raised the long-term margin guidance for its aerospace division Tuesday morning. That’s good news for investors. (Who could use some good news after trade fears have roiled the industrial sector for the past few days.) Honeywell (ticker: HON) is hosting an analyst event Tuesday and, in addition to increasing aerospace division targets, reaffirmed 2019 guidance given on the company’s earnings conference call in April. That’s some more good news. The company expects to earn about $8 a share at the midpoint of management guidance. That means Honeywell shares are trading at 20.8 times earnings, an 18% premium to their historical average and a 30% premium to stock in the        Dow Jones Industrial Average.      Investors are paying that premium, in part, because of the strength of the aerospace industry. Aerospace trends are benefiting Honeywell and other aerospace suppliers too.  The back story. Honeywell, with a market value of more than $127 billion, including debt, is one of the largest industrial companies in the world. Its operations touch many segments of the global economy including energy and aerospace. CEO Darius Adamczyk took over for longtime CEO David Cote about two years ago. Adamczyk has some big shoes to fill. Cote outperformed peers over his 15-year tenure. Honeywell stock returned 15% a year on average under Cote, about 3 percentage points better than other industrials over the same span.  What’s new. The presentations are ongoing Tuesday morning, but Honeywell management raised long-term aerospace margin targets from 25% to 27%. “Long-term segment margin targets were raised in Aerospace…as well as in HBT Honeywell Building Technologies—to 23% from 20%,” wrote Barclay’s analyst Julian Mitchell Tuesday morning. He added that margin targets were lowered in the Performance Materials and Technologies segment and left unchanged in Safety and Productivity Solutions, which includes products for warehouse automation, among other things. The overall impact of the guidance update is a 0.5% expansion in firmwide profitability, according to Mitchell.  Looking ahead. Aerospace is arguably the best-performing industrial end market. More people flying drives demand and the International Air Transportation Association said passengers on planes grew 6.5% in 2018 and are expected to double by 2037. That’s good news for the aerospace and defense suppliers.            Boeing’s      (BA) woes are well known, but            Airbus      (AIR.France) is an option for investors still wanting plane manufacturing exposure and willing to invest in an overseas stock.            United Technologies      (UTX) is breaking into three companies, one will be dedicated solely to aerospace and defense. Of course, there are other aerospace options for investors to consider such as            Textron      (TXT) and materials producer            Arconic      (ARNC), to name two more.

0,"Industrial-technology providers            Zebra Technologies      and            Cognex      reported earnings Tuesday. Both companies beat Wall Street sales and adjusted earnings-per-share estimates. Topping expectations sounds good on the surface, but both stocks traded significantly lower after reporting results. Zebra stock (ticker: ZBRA) closed down 7% on Tuesday. Cognex stock (CGNX) ended with a 6% loss. And that’s good news in at least one respect. It gives investors a chance to invest in the growing trend of industrial automation at a better price. Of course no one wants their stock portfolio to decline in value, but nothing we heard on either conference call impacts the long-term growth drivers of either business. “We executed well and sales grew 9%,” CEO Anders Gustafsson told Barron’s in a phone interview. “All business lines grew and we increased revenue guidance.” That doesn’t sound like a recipe for a stock decline. Gustafsson went on to add, “Asia was our fastest-growing region and China was up 12% in the first quarter.”That’s the second time in as many days a CEO has told Barron’s that Chinese growth has improved.            TE Connectivity      (TEL) CEO Terrence Curtin told us Chinese orders grew 9% in TE’s first quarter and the worse was passed for that economy. It’s possible that Zebra shares are being dragged down by Cognex, whose stock-price decline is easier to understand. Cognex management forecast second-quarter sales of $195 million–$8 million below, or 4%, what Wall Street was expecting.  Baird analyst Richard Eastman explained in a research report that large consumer-electronics orders don’t repeat each year, creating a 2019 sales headwind, but adds that Cognex is “still well positioned for multiple secular tailwinds and insistent the 2019 weakness not indicative of market share loss.” Cognex supplies vision systems to assemblers of            Apple      (AAPL) iPhones and other consumer-electronics devices.  Barron’s wrote positively about Cognex on Dec. 28 when shares traded for $37.71. Back then industrial shares were down, near 52-week lows and trading for 15 times estimated 2019 earnings, a discount to their historical average. Our Cognex call wasn’t valuation-based. In December, Cognex shares traded at more than 30 times estimated earnings. The stock’s multiple is justified, as the top line has been growing quickly. Cognex sales have grown an average 22% a year for the past three years.Lower growth would be a problem for a stock with a premium valuation multiple, but, while lumpy, the direction of Cognex sales is up. Eastman predicts the company will generate $927 million in 2020 sales, up 17% from this year. Gustafsson doesn’t see a reason for sales growth to decelerate either. And new catalysts for the adoption of industrial-automation technology are emerging. For instance, the            Amazon.com      (AMZN) move to one-day free shipping for Prime customers keeps pressure on retailers to adopt the latest warehouse-automation technology. “Strong competition spurs innovation and everyone has to embrace technology,” explains Gustafsson.Zebra shares have returned almost 50% a year for the last three years, but they still trade at less than 17 times estimated 2019 earnings, in line with other industrial companies. That’s why days like Tuesday can be a good thing for savvy investors. Cognex is more expensive. It trades at 43 times estimated earnings, a big premium to the U.S. industrial sector. But Barron’s still believes Cognex has the leading technology in a growing field. Which stock—be it Zebra, Cognex, or another automation firm—appeals to investors depends on what kind of investors they are. But no matter what mix of growth and margins appeal to an investor, we think the trend toward higher industrial automation warrants a closer look.
